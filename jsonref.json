Dr Bux, in considering the diagnosis, undertook a telephone consultation with the ill holidaymaker and diagnosed infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which he concluded was due to inadequate food preparation and food handling at the hotel.Karen Smith, Operations Manager for Beachcomber Tours, handled this claim and had concerns that Dr Bux\u0027s diagnosis differed from that of the doctor at the resort. She also discovered that Dr Bux\u0027s wife was a Partner at AMS Solicitors.              Dr Bux was found to be at fault for failing to disclose his solicitor wife Sehana (right) was a director for AMS, the solicitors firm which had commissioned him to act as a medical witness in county court claims (left: Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester)Further cases involved one claim in Fuerteventura where a patient suffered a rash in November 2015 and was treated in hospital on the island. In his report dated 26 July 2016, Dr Bux diagnosed the patient with an anaphylactic reaction secondary to infective gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning.A couple went on holiday to Benidorm in June 2015, and both complained of falling ill with food poisoning and both made a claim against TUI. Dr Bux produced reports dated 24 August 2016 and 25 August 2016 diagnosing both with infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which was caused by inadequate food preparation and handling, although he only spoke to them on the telephone.Allegations were found proven in each of the holiday cases, with Dr Bux failing to declare his personal relationship with his wife at AMS and diagnosing food poisoning without sufficient evidence.Tribunal chairman Julia Oakford said as Dr Bux\u0027s wife was a salaried partner at AMS, managing the litigation department, it was difficult to conclude she would have no knowledge or sight of the claims.The panel also ruled the doctor\u0027s actions were misleading, dishonest and financially motivated.She added: \u0027The tribunal found that Dr Bux diagnosed food poisoning alone as it was in his interest to write a positive report to enable him to sustain this stream of work.\u0027Expert witness Nigel Zoltie also criticised Dr Bux for circumcising the 15-month-old, referred to as Patient A, in a community setting.He said: \u0027It remains my opinion that all actions were likely to put Patient A at high risk of life-threatening complications that could only managed with great difficulty in the community. \u0027For a religious procedure these risks were unacceptable, and therefore the care was seriously below standard.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Lion cub tries sound vicious manages high pitched squeak","story":"Share this article Someone asks if the animals all make that sound and a zoo worker replies: \u0027It will turn into a growl later.\u0027When the animal makes the noise again the zoo worker adds: \u0027Aah you\u0027re so vicious, come on!\u0027As the animal begins to move, one person says: \u0027Get up little baby.\u0027         In the clip, the animal lifts its cheeks baring teeth while letting out a squeak. It is not clear where the video, taken in 2010, was filmedIt continues to squeak as onlookers laugh and one says: \u0027Aw, it\u0027s okay.\u0027As the animal lies back down, a male voice can be heard saying: \u0027That is one good-looking cat!\u0027 Rachel Kane posted the footage to YouTube with the caption: \u0027I uploaded this video a few months ago.

The way people consume media is different now and people are conditioned to the idea of subscription because of services like Netflix.‘A BBC subscription service is an idea that’s gathering pace and I hope we will see some radical thinking about this.’Last night a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said the Government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the Corporation until 2027.A BBC spokesman said: ‘The licence fee ensures a universal BBC which serves everyone, is the most popular funding system among the public and is agreed as the method of funding the BBC for another eight years, so any debate about future funding is a long way off.’This year the BBC faced even more criticism about the licence fee than usual when it announced that it would no longer fund free licences for all over-75s.The free licences were funded by the Government, but as part of the 2015 charter renewal negotiations, the responsibility was passed to the Corporation.The BBC announced that from next June it would only fund licences for the 900,000 households on pension credit – meaning 3.7million would have to pay.Yesterday an analysis found that 1.7million pensioners face a cut in their living standards next year when the change comes in.State pensions are to rise by 3.9 per cent next year in line with the increase in average earnings. But calculations by insurers Royal London reveal that for many pensioners over the age of 75, much of this rise will be wiped out by the £154.50 a year they will have to spend on their TV licence.Royal London says that while most single people on a basic state pension will see their payment go up by £5.05 per week to £134.25, those having to pay their licence for the first time will lose £2.97 a week of the increase.It means that 1.7million single pensioners over 75 will only see a real increase in their pensions of 1.6 per cent next year – lower than the 1.7 per cent rate of inflation.

The other is that Britain’s departure from the European Union is so mistaken that it must be reversed, once again with least damage.More than three years on some of us are still juggling, even as Boris Johnson heads to Brussels. The thing that keeps the juggling alive is not, in the end, an inability to make up our minds. I am a remainer. Full stop. The question is how to respond to Brexit in the political circumstances of the moment, in the best long-term interests of the country as a whole? The answer has evolved. But it will soon be make-our-minds-up time.Back in 2016 my response to the leave victory was to lament it bitterly but to say that Britain should continue to hug Europe as close as possible, even while leaving. This would help to protect jobs, secure the Irish peace process, and allow Scotland’s remain vote to be treated with enough respect to avoid Brexit becoming a threat to the union. A decade or so down the line, my rationale went, it might then be possible to reopen the question of EU membership, especially if the EU had continued to evolve in a multispeed manner, and if post-Jeremy Corbyn Labour had got off the fence to support Britain’s place in Europe.Instead, the longer that process has gone on, the wider the gap has grown between the original democratic deference owed to the idea of “leaving” in 2016 and the real-world consequences of the detailed version on offer in 2019. Simultaneously, however, the passage of time has made no difference at all to one very big thing: the concern among many leave voters that what they wanted in 2016 has still not happened. To reconcile these two realities is almost impossible, because it pits the malleable pragmatism of representative government against the rigid mandate of government by populist referendum.As the process has lengthened, so the options have widened. This isn’t the conspiracy that some claim to see. It is simply the entropy of politics at work. Few talked about a second referendum back in 2016. But the issue is central to the debate now. Almost no one in 2016, certainly not Johnson, imagined the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all. Today, despite the ongoing talks, no deal is a Johnson government policy option. In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, reversing the 2016 result had few supporters. Today it is the policy of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP and both are prospering in the polls.There is no perfect choice to be made on Brexit. The fault with that lies in the way the referendum process was devised – verdict first, terms later. All the options come with risks, often very big ones. But we don’t solve anything by wishing we could have made better choices at previous turnings along the way. The here and now choice takes two forms. The first is between Johnson’s deal, no deal and remaining in the EU. The other, which applies as much to hardline leavers as it does to remainers, is between folding and fighting on.The case for Johnson’s deal is that it means Britain leaves the EU in line with the referendum vote. That’s not a minor civic consideration. People are weary and angry. A deal could draw some of the worst poison from public attitudes to politics. It would satisfy the many (more than some of us want to think) who just want the whole thing over, although in reality almost everything about Britain’s future relationship with the EU is still to be decided. It might, if you agree with Corbyn, allow a general election to be fought on “real”, that is to say domestic, economic and social issues.But it would still be a terrible deal and that can’t be ignored, however weary we are. It would mean buying a pig in a poke and hoping that what’s inside entails a good future for the British people. It would defer rather than solve the Irish border crisis. It would risk breaking up the union. It would instantly worsen the UK’s trading position, with severe short- and long-term impacts on the economy and jobs. It would weaken the UK in the negotiations during the transition period. And it would set Britain at odds with its only true geographic and regional allies.The lesson of the past three years needs to be faced. That lesson is not that politicians are out of touch or failing to listen. It is the opposite. It’s not that the country can get along with Brexit. It is the opposite of that too. The lesson is that Brexit won’t work.Brexit won the vote. But it’s an ideology not a policy. When its supporters tried to turn it into policies, as they are still trying to do, it fell apart. It made things worse. These three years have been the leavers’ fault and no one else’s. That’s why obstructing no deal has been so important.But it’s also why preventing Johnson’s deal is important too. Optimism and slapdash policy will not make Britain a global power. Theresa May was right when she said Brexit means Brexit. That’s exactly what’s wrong with it. It’s why, in the end, Britain has to do everything possible to retain its place in Europe, in spite of the difficulties, and persuade its people in a new campaign – not with a message of fear, but with a message that pro-Europeans are listening to what’s wrong with the country.It certainly will not be easy. Most battles are not fought on ground of one’s own choosing. But as long as the passage of time and the sheer folly of Brexit permit the possibility of remaining, Britain should make up its mind to remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be196b54a2962e1a8382a662080fe76138855ce/179_0_5022_3015/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0928611701de36fb9e2c2245fa6030f","title":"wildlife photographer of the year 2019 winners in pictures","story":"Hailing from the Chinese province of Qinghai, Yongqing Bao has won the prestigious wildlife photographer of the year 2019 title for his image The Moment, which frames the standoff between a Tibetan fox and a marmot.

We need to try not to concede goals and score. I think the away goals only really matter if you score again in the second leg.”The hosts took the lead through Janine Beckie before Corral, who scored 86 goals in 117 appearances for Levante before joining Atlético, ensured City face a tough return leg.The most alluring tie of the round did not quite live up to that billing. But in Lauren Hemp, who was making her third appearance of the season after a spell out with a shoulder injury, City had the brightest player on the pitch. The 19-year-old ran Carmen Menayo and Aïssatou Tounkara ragged, and it was her shot that led to their goal. Hemp’s low effort was saved by the Netherlands goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal but a poor clearance enabled Keira Walsh to play a ball through the middle. The pass took a deflection but ran kindly for Beckie, who powered it coolly into the roof of the net with her first touch. It was her fifth goal of the season and all have come in the Champions League.City were ahead but Atlético could have punished them in the opening minutes. A free-kick from the edge of the box was swung towards goal only for Ellie Roebuck to acrobatically palm the ball away. It fell to Toni Duggan in the six-yard box but the former City forward could only direct the follow-up over the bar. Rather than spurring the visiting side on though, it would be their only real chance of the half, with City dominating possession and whipping the ball around. The England right-back Demi Stokes returned to the starting lineup for City and combined smartly with Hemp, with shades of the Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris partnership to their link-up play and Jill Scott characteristically supporting the flank play from inside.At half-time Cushing would have been significantly happier with his team’s relaxed but assured performance compared with their showing against the La Liga champions here last year. In the round of 32 a valuable away goal in Madrid, tempered by Kenti Robles’s 89th-minute leveller, was thrown away within four minutes in Manchester. Atlético then doubled their lead and City found no way back.This time round they were facing a very different Atlético side, one that was turned over 6-1 by Barcelona in their second game of the season and with a new manager, Pablo López.“It was tough. We knew it would be difficult,” said Duggan, whose attitude was praised by López as “extraordinary”.“We lost our coach which is always difficult. We had a tough game on Saturday then had to travel here. I am so proud of the team. It means so much to us.“The performance we put in, the injuries we have got, the week we have had, it was a positive performance from us all. We haven’t seen the best from Atlético but we are near the top of the table and competing in the Champions League.”City too are a very different side. Further into the season they are fitter and fresher than against Atlético last year. But it was the Spanish side who pushed for an equaliser on the break in the second half.Struggling to break through City’s commanding backline, which had conceded only once in seven games, Maria Santos tried to catch Roebuck out from distance but could only loop the ball over the bar.Hemp should have doubled City’s lead after a burst into the box from the left but Laia Aleixandri threw her body in the way. In the end the hosts were punished.Ludmila Silva surged down the right, shoulder to shoulder with Stokes, and having got the better of the full-back passed into the middle for Corral to poke in the late equaliser. City now have a testing run, with away trips to Manchester United, Arsenal and Madrid. “I never think we won’t get a goal so we are just looking forward to that game now,” said Scott. “I’d rather play Arsenal every week. These are the games that I was like an excited kid waiting for. These runs excite the team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b4ca24a8ad97f332e3e09a6b015d7e74409079/0_139_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2b51c2cedeb37527ccc0ca864b487e","title":"womens football have you tried to set up a grassroots team","story":"We want to hear from those who have struggled to set up women’s football teams Women’s football has seen a score of successes in recent months: England’s top league went professional, the World Cup was watched by record-breaking audiences and crowds during the current FA cup are growing.The number of girls and women taking up the sport has also skyrocketed, with 605 new girls youth teams and 260 new adult female clubs registered to play this season.But some women have experienced difficulties in accessing facilities, such as pitches.

They obviously have other sources of income as well. So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.”Sources in her department later suggested that it would not be a priority for Morgan and pointed out that the government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC until 2027 for the duration of the 11-year charter period.However, her comments will boost the hopes of some Tory MPs who dislike the BBC and have long been campaigning for an end to the universal £154.50-a-year licence fee. A subscription service like Netflix would mean people having to opt in to watch programmes on BBC channels and listen to its radio stations.The idea was recently raised by the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank, which was welcomed by Knight, who predicted: “Personally, I think the next licence fee will be the last.”In the same hearing, Morgan said she would not intervene in the BBC’s decision to abolish free TV licences for over-75s.She said she had “no plans” to review the BBC’s television licence shake-up, after the broadcaster agreed in 2015 to fund the free licences given to those aged over 75.The BBC announced this year that only low-income households in receipt of pension credits would receive the benefit, meaning around 3.7 million elderly people will have to pay £154.50 a year in future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd67411371a9a294fd623e369476d85222ea87b5/0_332_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98dd06efe01e9af0590fde47a87e7de8","title":"on the frontline as us troops leave northern syria","story":"Martin Chulov, who covers the Middle East for the , has spent the past week on the frontline of north-east Syria.

He’ll say Corbyn has the right to form a government and we should do this early.“If feels as if there is this dialogue between the two parties about their own position on interim PM, despite the numbers which have shown Corbyn does not have support across the Commons, and specifically about Indyref2.”The SNP has blamed the Lib Dems for the hostile briefing, branding it “childish”.The SNP has in recent weeks agreed publicly with Labour that if there is to be an interim government after a vote of no confidence in Johnson, it is constitutionally correct to allow Corbyn to attempt to lead it as prime minister.Blackford exclusively told the  last month that the party in Westminster was ready to support Corbyn, should there be a vote of no confidence in Johnson over his Brexit strategy.He said: “From an administrative point of view, somebody else has to be in office to allow that to happen. Under our constitution, it is the case the official leader of the opposition has the first opportunity to be such a person.”Swinson has consistently said she does not think Corbyn is fit to be prime minister and would support another person taking on the job of interim leader, such as the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke or Labour’s Harriet Harman.An SNP source has previously said it would be too complicated to try and find another figure for people to unite around.There have been positive noises from the Labour leadership about a second referendum in Scotland. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said in August he would not want to block another vote. More recently Corbyn said it was not a priority for the party should it get into power, and that it was not a good idea, but that he would not rule it out.It is thought Labour may call on the support of the SNP should it end up being the largest party at an election but short of a majority, and that agreeing to another independence referendum could be the Scottish party’s price. Both Labour and the SNP have so far ruled out a formal coalition.One opposition MP said about the cross-party Brexit meetings: “Even in the most casual of conversations, it’s been clear the SNP are trying to use cross-party working to get support for another Indyref.“With Corbyn making noises about not objecting and the SNP ignoring the numbers to support him as an interim PM, it doesn’t take a genius to see the mutual convenience.”A Labour party spokesperson said: “Jeremy Corbyn has hosted a series of productive meetings with opposition party leaders in order to work together today to hold the government to account and prevent a disastrous no-deal Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356cd587da910aac251849863c7cc5d945d16507/565_0_1861_1116/master/1861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc44f20887004af1493faa7431d57744","title":"stephen barclay pointless brexit secretary","story":"Everything about Westminster’s invisible man is designed with forgettability in mindIf Stephen Barclay didn’t exist, would anyone notice his absence? He is Westminster’s very own invisible man. Someone so forgettable that not even his own reflection recognises him. A man who slips in and out of rooms without leaving a trace. No one can even be quite sure if he has human form or if he is just some shape-shifting ectoplasm.Everything about him has been designed with forgettability in mind. His voice is liquid valium. Calming to the point of comatose, each word more meaningless than the one before. By the end of a sentence you are far worse informed than if he had said nothing. His ideal job would be a doctor specialising in telling patients that their cancer was now terminal. Because everyone would have either nodded off or died before they had managed to absorb the news.All of which has made him a more than satisfactory Brexit secretary. The man for no seasons, who has understood his role is entirely ceremonial and whose functions merely extend to opening and closing ring-binders. Someone who can’t give away a negotiating position even by accident, simply because everyone knows he is never present at meetings where such decisions are taken.Any appearance by Barclay before the Brexit select committee is therefore inherently pointless. A matter of protocol to be observed. Today’s was more futile than usual because it was blindingly obvious to the entire world that even those who were meant to know what was going on were completely clueless. Brexit had come down to a game of Russian roulette with Boris Johnson, the DUP and the ERG taking it in turns to hold a gun to the country’s head.At the start, committee chair Hilary Benn spoke largely to himself. Would the Commons be sitting on Saturday? Would there be a full legal text of any new withdrawal agreement and political declaration? If there was no agreement by end of Saturday would the prime minister send the letter requesting an extension? Barclay merely smiled and shrugged. “Words, mumble, words, mumble, words,” he said, his synapses stubbornly refusing to connect with one another.Benn then tried pressing the Brexit secretary on what were the actual existing rules to which Northern Ireland would revert if the DUP denied consent. Barclay looked amazed. The committee shouldn’t worry its pretty little head about something that might happen next year or four years after that. Rather it should be concentrating on getting through the day. The event horizon was that near.After 20 minutes, Tory Eurosceptics Craig McKinlay – who had spent the whole session reading the Guido Fawkes website, doing a bit of online shopping and checking on an email from the Brexit party – and Andrea Jenkyns interrupted proceedings to say they had had enough of Benn being beastly to Barclay by asking him awkward questions. Richard Graham, bristling with passive aggression, chipped in by suggesting Benn should be appearing before the committee to explain his lack of patriotism in trying to prevent the country becoming even more worse off with a no-deal Brexit.“Splendid,” said Benn evenly. Maybe Jenkyns would like to have her go? I love Boris, me, she said. Boris is amazing. The Best. Whatever deal he brings back will be good enough for me. Even Barclay appeared slightly taken aback by her fan-girl enthusiasm, though he was relieved she didn’t actually have any questions for him. She just wanted to vent. McKinlay merely wanted to know if the lights he had been looking at online had been made in the EU and, if so, whether that would subject him to permanent vassalage.Barclay eased himself through the rest of the session with minimum fuss. Labour MPs shouldn’t pay too much attention to the fact that the new deal might have replaced “regulatory alignment” with “regulatory ergence”. That was just a typo that no one had got round to Tippexing out. The very idea that the government was in a race to the bottom was absurd.And no, he couldn’t confirm the status of current trade deals. He’d been too busy concentrating on knowing nothing. But luckily, Liz Truss had everything in hand. A wave of panic went through the room. “Why have the DUP and the ERG been invited into discussions and Scotland and Wales ignored?” SNP MP Joanna Cherry demanded. Whatever. Barclay yawned. If she was feeling left out he’d arrange for someone even more junior and dimmer than him to give her a ring in a couple of weeks or so.The only real confrontation came from the DUP’s Sammy Wilson who couldn’t understand why his party’s right to veto any deal with Ireland had not been set in stone. As instructed by the prime minister, Barclay passed him a note with “Will another £5bn shut you up” written in green ink.

Business representatives believe the big companies such as supermarket chains will be able to put systems in place to deal with any checks but will be looking for government assistance to help smaller businesses.Will there be a border through the Irish Sea immediately if parliament votes for a deal?No. The discussion over the Irish border is part of Boris Johnson’s alternative arrangements to the controversial backstop. It will only be triggered if the UK and EU do not seal their main trade deal before the end of the transition period.What kind of checks will be made?The extent and type of checks will not be clear until the detail of the deal emerges, but essentially they fall into two categories: tariffs and VAT. Excise duties also apply but will not trouble most importers as they generally apply to a limited amount of controlled goods including alcohol, cigarettes and fuel.Who will be required to have their goods checked?Customs declarations apply for both exports and imports and, although the trade is domestic, for the purposes of this version of a Brexit backstop, the checks will be made on behalf of the EU. It is concerned about goods from a third country leaking into Ireland and therefore the single market.What will businesses selling to Northern Ireland have to do?Exporters from Great Britain will be required to fill out complicated customs declaration forms. Anna Jerzewska, an independent customs consultant, says each form has 50 fields and, according to government estimates last week, will take 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete.Each business will have to establish all its commodity codes, a 10-digit number unique to each product that determines the precise tariff applicable.Using school shirts as an example, the code will vary according to the components in the shirt: whether the shirt is of knitted fabric, cotton, whether it has sleeves, pockets, whether the overlap at the front is right over left or left over right.“All these commodity codes have to be exact and if you get it wrong you could be committing an offence,” said Jerzewska. “People will have to find that code and that will be a challenge. Imagine if you had to find the commodity code for your laptop. Where would you even start?”What happens when the goods arrive in Belfast?The “buyer” or importer will have to pay an EU tariff. This is likely to be collected on behalf of the EU by UK officials, although in time it is likely to be an electronic transaction.What happens if the importer is also selling that shirt to schools in Dublin?There will not be any check on the box of shirts as it crosses the border, but the importer will not get a rebate on this consignment if it is sold in Dublin.Will getting a rebate be easy?It is not clear how the government intends to proceed with the tariff arrangements but if it works like the Dover-Calais system it will not be easy.There is no system set up for a seamless tariff pay and refund system that will be the success or failure at the heart of the new Irish backstop. Currently the EU operates a streamlined refund system for VAT known as VIES (VAT information exchange system) across Europe.There is nothing similar for tariffs, leaving retailers and traders concerned. “People won’t want to pay tariffs upfront and then wait weeks for a refund because it will kill your working capital. It will have to be a seamless invisible transaction,” said Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60a429407a99875a2582d3cf649be4a6feb8f3a7/0_911_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=320b7dcd7110f50ffd452df1f26db6f4","title":"fastest ants in world northern sahara","story":"Silver ants travel 108 times their body length per second and have stride rate 10 times that of Usain BoltThe sand dunes of the northern Sahara are home to the fastest ants in the world, according to researchers who clocked the insects foraging for food in the blistering midday sun.Video footage reveals the ants galloping across the scorching sand at speeds approaching one metre per second, the equivalent of a house cat tearing about at 120mph.The faster the ants ran, the more they took to the air, in gallops that brought all six legs off the ground at once. At full pelt, the insects travelled 108 times their body length per second, the researchers found.“They fly through the air with no feet on the ground from stride to stride,” even at relatively slow speeds, said Sarah Pfeffer, who studies animal behaviour at Ulm University in Germany.There is a reason Saharan silver ants, or Cataglyphis bombycina, have evolved to be fleet of foot. Unlike other desert creatures which shelter from the intense noon heat, for the ants it is a prime time to scavenge. When the desert is at its hottest, they emerge from their nests and zip about looking for food – often the carcasses of less fortunate creatures that have succumbed to the brutal temperatures.To survive, the ants have silvery hairs that reflect the sun’s rays. But even with this coating and other adaptations, the ants can barely survive the 60C (140F) heat and need impressive speed and navigational skills to find food and return to the nest before falling victim to the heat themselves.Before Pfeffer and her colleagues could clock the ants racing around the desert, they first had to find them. The scientists travelled to Douz, a town in southern Tunisia, and scoured the nearby dunes for the streaks of silver that are the ants in motion.Having traced some ants back to their nest, the researchers laid an aluminium channel along the ground and placed mealworms or shortbread crumbs at the far end. Above the track they attached a downwards-facing high-speed video camera to record the ants as they tore back and forth.Once slowed down, the footage shows the ants coordinating their movements with incredible precision, moving three legs – which work together as a tripod – at a time. Running flat out, the ants covered 85.5cm per second in 47 strides, more than 10 times Usain Bolt’s stride rate. Between each stride, each ant foot touched the ground for as little as seven milliseconds.Similar footage of another fast desert ant, Cataglyphis fortis, which is found in the Tunisian salt pans, recorded the insects hitting a top speed of 62cm per second. Details are published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.While the Saharan silver ants have shorter legs than their salt pan cousins, the furious stride rate more than compensates, the scientists found. Beyond teasing out the biomechanical secrets of the ants’ incredible speed, the research reveals tricks that engineers can exploit to build smaller, faster, scampering robots, Pfeffer said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291ad85edcc6202c90247d896308922644bfc3d2/85_0_2722_1633/master/2722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f6459cf3e1555361c04c07493d870f0","title":"nasa women spacewalk suit sizes space station","story":"Christina Koch and Jessica Meir to make history after delay over suit sizes available at stationNasa is planning the first ever all-female spacewalk as early as Thursday, the space agency has announced.The women’s mission is to replace a faulty battery charging unit on the outside of the station, which failed last weekend, Nasa said.Astronauts and cosmonauts have completed more than 200 spacewalks during the construction and maintenance of the International Space Station, but only 15 women have ever been on a spacewalk, always accompanied by men. There hasn’t been an all-female event in more than a half-century of space walking.The walk was originally scheduled to take place more than six months ago, involving Koch and the Nasa astronaut Anne McClain, but the exercise had to be delayed because Nasa did not have enough of the correctly sized suits available and ready to use on the station. There was only one useable medium-sized suit available in time, and the women needed one each.McClain came back to Earth in June and Nasa has since blasted a second medium spacesuit up to the station, so that the walk – which could take place on Thursday or Friday – could happen.“It turns out that over the next couple of years we’re having a lot of medium-suit people fly, and so that’s the sweet spot,” the program manager for the International Space Station, Kirk Shireman, told a press briefing earlier this month.Separately, the agency has unveiled prototypes of its next-generation spacesuits to be worn inside the Orion spacecraft and on the surface of the moon, because American astronauts are scheduled to return there as early as 2024.One is designed for walking on the moon. The other is a bright orange pressure suit to be worn when astronauts launch from Earth and return.Nasa recently demonstrated that the new suits will allow astronauts to bend, squat and lift their arms above their heads – a facility space suits have restricted until now.“This is the first suit we’ve designed in about 40 years,” Chris Hansen, a manager at Nasa’s spacesuit design office, said. “We want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the Moon.”Amy Ross, Nasa’s lead spacesuit engineer, said: “Basically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment and give them the mobility to do their job.”The new lunar suit should also help overcome Nasa’s spacesuit sizing issues: it is a one-size-fits-all garment designed for both men and women.Six people are serving on the space station’s current mission: Koch, Meir, fellow Nasa astronaut Andrew Morgan Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr Skvortsov and Oleg Skripochka and the European Space Agency’s Luca Parmitano."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca24ed5cedc7fbc2c9d05f1e0a22e271135867eb/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1346b19a982696a1b3b1b2f2feaedef7","title":"lebron james china hong kong comments nba","story":"Basketball’s biggest star is under fire after wading into the NBA’s China controversy, but his remarks are being weaponized by bad-faith actors trading in the very hypocrisy they allegeLeBron James has come under fire like never before after wading into the NBA’s China controversy. On Monday, the Los Angeles Lakers star finally broke his silence on the tweet heard around the world: Daryl Morey’s message of support for the Hong Kong protestors that’s threatened to upset the multibillion-dollar relationship between the NBA and the Chinese market it has spent three decades cultivating.LeBron told a group of reporters that Morey “wasn’t educated on the situation at hand” and that “so many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually” by the Houston Rockets executive’s seemingly off-the-cuff post. “So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too,” he said.LeBron is getting quite a bit of heat right now for comments that appear to suggest freedom of speech can have negative consequences. But at the same time it’s clear these remarks are largely being weaponized by many bad-faith actors trading in intellectual dishonesty in an effort to undermine the causes at home, including the state-sanctioned killings of unarmed black men in America, that LeBron has worked so hard to bring attention to. And why this erasure is happening is worthy of closer inspection.LeBron almost immediately clarified his remarks, saying he was not referencing the substance of Morey’s tweet, rather the way it created a potentially unsafe and hostile environment for the Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, who were in China for a preseason tour. Did Morey put the them in harm’s way? Could he have made the same valid points after they had returned home safely? Was it his place to put them in the middle of that fight? All valid questions from the athlete’s point of view.The premise that LeBron is not in touch with the gravity of the situation is Hong Kong is a misconception. But rather than parrot anodyne talking points, he took a leadership role among his cohorts on the ground in China amid the unexpected crisis, reportedly organizing a players-only meeting as the situation unfolded. One source told the Athletic’s Shams Charani that in the meeting – which featured players from the Lakers and Nets – players wanted to address why they were the ones that had to risk speaking out while they were in China, when the league should be the first ones to address the matter.This is not the act of a soulless profiteer as LeBron has been quickly cast, but a leader using his voice and agency to gather those around him and make sure everyone is on the same page in how to responsibly navigate an international crisis.TV pundits around the country spent Tuesday teeing off on what they viewed as LeBron’s hypocrisy while only exposing their own, following Donald Trump’s example of using sport as a racially isive tool for scapegoating and grandstanding to push a political agenda. To no one’s surprise Fox News led the charge.In the morning it was Fox’s Jared Max, who said: “I think LeBron James is thinking about himself. I don’t think he’s thinking about what people in Hong Kong are fighting for in this case. It’s OK to tweet when it’s LeBron’s issue, but when it’s something else hat he’s not behind and willing to put his name behind, then we have a problem?”In the evening, it was usual suspects Tucker Carlson (with an assist from Barstool Sports) and Laura Ingraham, who once lambasted LeBron and Kevin Durant for having the audacity to have an opinion on anything outside of basketball. Ingraham, it should be noted, once dedicated an entire segment of her show to mocking LeBron while making the case that he didn’t possess the intelligence to comment on anything outside of the borders of a court.Now we should be clear that LeBron is not above criticism, but my own conversations with prominent voices in the athlete activism space over the last few days stresses the importance of context – and the danger of adhering to the rules of critics whose motives are in bad faith.Dr Harry Edwards, the Berkeley professor and civil rights activist whose seminal 1973 work Sociology of Sport remains an essential blueprint for athlete activism to this day, warns us to consider the source.“So, predictably, the detractors of those black athletes who have been speaking out against and protesting the injustice of 147 mostly unarmed black people being murdered each year under cover of the badge are now attacking those same black athletes for not speaking out against and protesting the China-Hong Kong debacle, a political stance if assumed by black athletes would parrot and serve the political interests of those who are so critical of their anti-injustice dispositions regarding the circumstances of African Americans.”Even more to the point was Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, the former NBA star whose own career was cut short after he refused to stand for the national anthem while playing for the Denver Nuggets in 1996 – a protest that presaged Kaepernick’s movement by a generation.“African Americans who are well informed in particular are not unaware of the hypocrisy of presidents, politicians and commentators now wanting athletes to speak for causes that ultimately promote US exceptionalism and imperialism, domestically and abroad,” Abdul-Rauf told me, “while at the same time blatantly ignoring, to the point of a deathly silence, the plight of African Americans and people of color in this country.”He continued: “Until we see a need for international solidarity, linking our struggles with those of others the strength we desire will forever be minimal and the achievement of social justice not realized. I have a major problem with people who play these type of games thinking we are this dumb to parrot what they want us to so that it benefits them while our problems are ignored. Quit trying to tell us how, when, where and what to say if you are not willing to pay attention to our life and death pleas for fairness and equality.”John Carlos, whose Black Power salute on the podium at the 1968 Olympics is one of the enduring images of the athlete activist movement, told me: “They want to say players and coaches have to speak now. No, they don’t have to do anything. We will no longer be your puppets. We will not let you speak through us. Freedom of speech goes both ways: you have the right to speak and the right to be silent.”Again, LeBron’s remarks are not above rebuke, even when judged by the higher standard he’s opted into by stepping up as a leader for social justice causes. But conservative critics like Carlson and Whitlock and Trump and Ingraham and Ted Cruz, who denigrate athletes for speaking up against the human rights violations happening on American streets and do the same when they don’t for issues halfway around the world, are trading in the very double standard they allege. These people only care about democracy and freedom of speech and allowing athletes to use their platforms to speak about injustice when the position taken is convenient for their agendas. If it’s not, they want athletes to shut up and dribble. And that is the essence of hypocrisy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20219b1fccaef4b16e1c968b7af7e3e59291e6b6/324_0_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29b57ef5d597e59714559d79ad19a54","title":"patrick day charles conwell open letter","story":"Boxer Patrick Day has died after he sustained head injuries in a fight on Saturday night against fellow American Charles Conwell.The 27-year-old was knocked out in the 10th round of his super-welterweight bout in Chicago and fell into a coma, with his promoter confirming Day’s death on Wednesday “surrounded by his family, close friends and members of his boxing team”.“He was a son, brother, and good friend to many,” said a statement from Lou DiBella.“Pat’s kindness, positivity, and generosity of spirit made a lasting impression with everyone he met. Patrick Day didn’t need to box. He came from a good family, he was smart, educated, had good values and had other avenues available to him to earn a living.“He chose to box, knowing the inherent risks that every fighter faces when he or she walks into a boxing ring. Boxing is what Pat loved to do. It’s how he inspired people and it was something that made him feel alive.”Day was taken from the ring on a stretcher and underwent emergency brain surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after being knocked out in the final round of his fight on the undercard of Saturday night’s Oleksandr Usyk-Chazz Witherspoon show. The tragedy prompted Conwell to write an open letter to his fallen opponent which he posted Tuesday on Instagram.“This is my last time speaking on the situation because of this being a sensitive topic not only for his family and friends but for myself and the sport of boxing,” Conwell said, before addressing Day directly.“Dear Patrick Day,” Conwell wrote. “I never meant for this to happen to you. All I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would. No one deserves for this to happen to them. I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you. I can’t stop thinking about it myself. I prayed for you so many times and shedded so many tears because I couldn’t even imagine how my family and friends would feel.“I see you everywhere I go and all I hear is wonderful things about you. I thought about quitting boxing but I know that’s not what you would want. I know that you were a fighter at heart so I decided not to but to fight and win a world title because that’s what you wanted and that’s what I want so I’ll use you as motivation every day and make sure I always leave it all in the ring every time. #ChampPatrickDay. With Compassion, Charles Conwell.”DiBella, who promotes both Conwell and Day, told ESPN on Tuesday night that he was moved to tears by the fighter’s expression.“No one prompted him to write it – not his management and not his promoter,” DiBella said. “I know Charles is profoundly sad right now by what happened. I’m trying to make him realize it’s no fault of his. I read what he wrote and it put a tear in my eye. It was an incredibly human and honest and genuine response from a kid who is just 21. He’s a really good kid, a really good person. I think it was very obvious to both of them that they were both good guys. Charles’ letter was really touching. It screams of honesty and authenticity.”Boxing has been gripped by tragedy this year after the deaths of three fighters as a result from injuries sustained in competition.The Argentinian junior welterweight Hugo Alfredo Santillan died in July, becoming the second fatality in four days after Russia’s Maxim Dadashev succumbed to injuries suffered in Maryland. Bulgarian featherweight Boris Stanchov died in September after injuries suffered during his pro debut in Albania, after which it was discovered he was fighting illegally under his cousin Isus Velichkov’s boxing license."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f8d7ff8ff889ac5e159092c0c7b6306720608f3/0_14_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd8d081361512097dc2e8494f89c6a9","title":"rugby world cup england team australia","story":"Eddie Jones has sprung a huge surprise by dropping George Ford and naming Owen Farrell at fly-half for England’s World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday. Ford has been among England’s best performers at the World Cup so far but Jones has opted to restore his captain to the No 10 jersey.Henry Slade comes in at outside centre with Manu Tuilagi moving to No 12 while Mako Vunipola comes in at loosehead prop for his first start since May following a hamstring injury. Courtney Lawes is preferred to George Kruis in the second row while Billy Vunipola also makes his 13th consecutive start for England having recovered from his ankle injury.Jones’s decision to change his fly-half comes as a major shock after he seemed to have settled again on the Ford-Farrell axis.Tuilagi has also shone outside them in the three matches they have started together. Slade has been struggling with a knee problem however, but now back to full fitness Jones has reverted the midfield trio he favoured during the Six Nations. Farrell, Tuilagi and Slade have not lined up together since England’s capitulation to Scotland at the end of the Six Nations, however. Furthermore, Farrell has only started for England at fly-half once since then - the warm-up victory over Italy in Newcastle.It is not the first time Ford has been relegated to the bench for a key World Cup clash – four years ago Stuart Lancaster dropped him in favour of Farrell for the decisive defeat by Wales. But his form at the tournament – he was named man of the match against the USA – makes Jones’s decision to drop him all the more surprising. Not least when Farrell has been scratching around for form.Jones has also seen fit to select Mako Vunipola from the off despite the fact he has played little more than half an hour of rugby since May. He had been set to start the cancelled match against France last weekend with Joe Marler nursing a back injury. As the better scrummager Marler had been expected to start but Jones has opted to bring Vunipola straight into the fold.“Once you get to the quarter-finals it’s about having the right mindset,” said Jones. “We know how well we can play, it’s about us playing to our strengths and trying to take away from what Australia want. Australia are a clever team, they will have some specific attacking strategies to play against us so we need to have a great situational awareness. We need to defend with brutality and when we have the ball we need play on top of them.”The back three is unchanged from that which started England last match against Argentina while Ben Youngs continues at scrum-half. Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler join Mako Vunipola in the front row while Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill complete the pack. On the bench Lewis Ludlam is preferred to Mark Wilson as back-row cover and with Jack Nowell out injured with a hamstring injury, Jonathan Joseph comes on to the bench."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59bbdf7bbd6a28d5b0c048077863b6db1a0677c/33_39_2495_1497/master/2495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd2a73f5d67707eacc9375b3cd0eeb1d","title":"rugby union power rankings all blacks england ireland wales japan australia france south africa","story":"England, Ireland and Wales are among the throng pushing to challenge New Zealand as the World Cup enters crunch timeNormal service has been resumed. After the surreal scenes of the All Blacks not being No 1 (Wales were, then Ireland!) they enter the quarter‑finals back at the top of the rankings, rated by the bookies as twice as likely to win the tournament as the second favourites. Don’t be so sure. It goes without saying they remain the best when on form, but that cancelled game might well be more of a hindrance to them than anyone, given that their last meaningful fixture will have been four weeks before their quarter‑final against Ireland. At least Italy would have been semi-meaningful. These All Blacks are not invincible at the best of times. Current world ranking: 1The same concerns apply to England. Nobody should be under any illusion that the cancelled game will help them. Their draw had been perfect, a series of Tests neatly escalating in difficulty. But when the fourth rung was removed, quite a leap was created to a quarter-final with Australia. Otherwise, England are in good shape. Defence remains a big question-mark, but defence is so 2007. Only Wales seem to bother with it these days. In attack, England are as threatening as anyone. Off-the-cuff counterattacking remains the speciality of the All Blacks, but England have developed a variety of ways to undo defences, including at the start of games when everyone is fresh and there are no excuses. Current world ranking: 3In these curious times in which New Zealand are not necessarily miles ahead, a lot of people – uncomfortable with the idea of Wales, Ireland or, God forbid, England as likely candidates – have ventured South Africa as their tip. They won the Rugby Championship this year, after all (although no team has ever won that and the World Cup in the same year). They certainly boast as formidable a tight five as any, a pleasing blend of spark and ice at half-back, and Cheslin Kolbe. Oh, Cheslin Kolbe. Defensively, though, the 2007 vintage this is not. Current world ranking: 5Which brings us to the defensive masters. We have long been told that defences win these competitions — in which case, hand the gong to Wales now. There is a sense, though, that things have changed. Wales have embarked on quite the campaign of late, gathering a grand slam, a record winning run and the kudos of being No 1 in the world — and they’ve done it with scarcely a whiff of the sort of try to quicken the pulses back home. They’ve done it with scarcely a try full stop, registering 10 of them in that grand-slam campaign – the same as Italy. But they’re still here, they’re still winning. Current world ranking: 2Japan, meanwhile, are doing so much more than win rugby matches. They are dismantling all received wisdom about how this game should be played and by whom. The hateful notion of tiers one, two and three has been exploded. As successive members of the old guard are dispatched, what should really terrify rugby’s establishment is that this team hail from a country of 125 million whose economy is the third largest in the world. If rugby can bite even modestly into Japan’s national consciousness, everything changes. A new centre of gravity could emerge to rival the current black hole that is England and France. America next. Current world ranking: 7The world rankings have received a lot of ridicule of late, never more so than when Ireland attained top spot on the eve of this competition, despite a string of recent indignities to embarrass 2018’s grand slam winners. The truth is, though, the rankings are very tight now with no one having to do much to top them – and that feels about right. Here Ireland are, sixth on our list (fourth on World Rugby’s), but they are genuinely capable of winning this thing, given a realistic upturn in form. Rugby has never had so much competition among its top teams. Current world ranking: 4And here we have Australia, World Cup finalists last time and twice champions. They too, it should not be particularly contentious to assert, are capable of winning this with a run of form. There is something by-the-seat-of-the-pants about this lot, but they will be relishing a crack at England, who seem so highly regarded after their humiliation by this side four years ago. Barely a few weeks ago Australia put nearly 50 on none other than the All Blacks. They are a long way from favourites, but an Australian triumph cannot be ruled out either. Current world ranking: 6Dare we say the same of France? No, we dare not say anything about the French. This vintage is no different from any other – mutiny in the air, players sent home under suspicious circumstances, captains dropped, games won and nearly lost, chaos all round. And yet our eighth-ranked team are thrice finalists. Some of the rugby they have played has been devastating – and not just to themselves. They will look on Wales in the quarter-finals and shrug. Win there, and neither Japan nor South Africa would quite daunt them. They will not win the tournament, surely … but, well, you get the drift. They could. Current world ranking: 8A sobering few days, but let’s be clear: no team in the top 10 would have reacted any differently to the prospect of elimination without playing. They would sit comfortably in this top eight, but that no-show against Ireland will, and should, haunt them. Current world ranking: 9Fiji too would be worthy quarter‑finalists. They have produced an astonishing array of attacking talents — and that’s not counting all those they’ve supplied to other countries. Wins against Australia or Wales would not have flattered them. Defeat by Uruguay is borderline unfathomable. Current world ranking: 11Semi-finalists last time out, and here they are in 11th. This business of fielding the same team at international level as domestic isn’t working. They could have picked some overseas players but with what message to those who stay at home? A dilemma. Current world ranking: 10Better and better with each game – oh, what would a level playing field do for these Island teams? They finally clinched that win against USA, after a whisker away against France. There are 110,000 people in Tonga. That’s the population of Chesterfield. Current world ranking: 13Europe’s answer to the Pacific Islanders, but a natural affinity for the muscular gets them only so far without the flair. Still, the same questions apply: what might they become with regular exposure? There’s no sign of any solution to that conundrum. Current world ranking: 14Authors of the second biggest upset in World Cup history. Uruguay’s overturning of a 30-point handicap with the bookies against Fiji is second only to Japan’s 42-point handicap against South Africa four years ago. Against Wales, they flirted for a while with equalling the latter upset. Incredible. Current world ranking: 18No scope for them to progress or regress. Isolated in the middle of their pool, way below the top two, way above the bottom, third was all they were ever going to get, even with a bonus two points against the All Blacks. Current world ranking: 12Disappointing. Partly because expectations were high. USA had been rising steadily through the teens in those rankings, but they were flat in their opener against England and never quite discovered themselves. A Japan-USA final in 2043, anyone? Current world ranking: 17They will always, along with Fiji and Tonga, hold the moral high ground, such are the gifts they have bestowed on a rugby world that gives so little in return. Alas, here they gave their fair share of gifts to the opposition too. Current world ranking: 15They snuck in through the back door and found themselves opening the tournament against the hosts in Tokyo. Won a lot of friends with a feisty display in defeat, including the tournament’s opening try, but that was it for them and tries. Current world ranking: 20At one point their very participation was in doubt, World Rugby concerned about the integrity of Namibia’s governing body. No doubting that of Phil Davies and his happy band. They troubled teams rated far higher. A great shame their final game against Canada was cancelled. Current world ranking: 23The decline of Canada is one of World Rugby’s more perplexing dilemmas. The former quarter-finalists should not have fallen so low. Much hope is invested in America’s new domestic league and this will hopefully help revive them, but too soon for this World Cup.

His thumbprint, needed to prove his identity, wasn’t registering on the new system.He was told to do an online update. But to do so he would need to get to a private centre – a four-mile journey from his village in Dumka, in the state of Jharkhand, north-east India. This would mean missing at least a day’s potential work, which he desperately needed to buy food. And even if he made the trek, there was no guarantee that the system, which often suffers from network outages, would be working properly. What was to be done?In the past, Manjhi and other low-income Indians only needed papers to pick up subsidised grains to feed themselves. But the welfare system in India has undergone dramatic change.Each person claiming support is now required to have an Aadhaar, a unique 12-digit number that is linked to their biometric and demographic data. The scheme has grown so quickly since its introduction in 2009 that it now covers more than 1.2 billion people and is the world’s largest biometric identification system.The Indian government argued that this system would revolutionise welfare: computerised checks would stop fraudsters from siphoning off other people’s benefits, allowing more money to reach the poor. But campaigners say its design is flawed and it is riddled with technological glitches. They argue it has become a Kafkaesque nightmare that has caused misery for the very people it claims to protect.Despite the serious concerns raised by economists and poverty experts, the system kept on growing and is now involved in access to anything from a pension to medical reimbursements or disaster emergency relief. Activists say in some cases parents are wrongly being asked for an Aadhaar number in order to enrol their children in school.Even if a person is lucky enough to find out what has caused the disruption, this doesn’t mean the problem will be solved. “Officials at district level or lower district level may be able to tell you why your payment has stopped they may not be able to tell you how to fix it,” Khera said.In Majhi’s case, the problem of his unrecognised thumbprint was left unresolved as he couldn’t take the time to make the trek to the centre. Meals were missed – just a few to start, then more and more often – and Manjhi became extremely thin.On 22 May he collapsed outside the family home. Neighbours rushed to help as his wife, Alabati Devi, tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance took him to hospital but it was too late. He died aged 50.No one declared the cause of his death, but the family believe it was starvation. “When he came back from looking for work he said: ‘Give me food or I will die,’” said Devi. There was nothing to give him. Hours later he fainted. All he had eaten that day was a small portion of rice and toddy palm fruit, which grows nearby their home.“He was malnourished because of the lack of the food,” said Devi, who noted he had no other illnesses.The family was living hand to mouth, said Bijay Prasad Kapi, a social activist who has supported Devi and many others. “They didn’t have any food, they couldn’t afford to store any rice. They didn’t know where to get help.” Devi was entitled to a pension but this had not arrived in her account since January.The block development officer for Majhi’s neighborhood was not reachable and the supply officer declined to comment.Activists have tracked 13 cases in Jharkhand where people who were refused support due to aadhaar glitches have allegedly died of starvation. One was an 11-year-old girl. The death of Santoshi Kumari, whose family’s ration card was cancelled because it was not linked to Aadhaar, shocked the country in 2017. Officials denied that Santoshi died of starvation and said her death was due to malaria. Other cases of alleged starvation deaths have also been denied by the government.Campaigners say the system continues to be fraught with problems. Fingerprints don’t scan properly, officials fail to offer timely assistance and internet coverage is too poor for the system to function.Pansure Murmu, who runs a ration shop in Jammu, said Aadhaar worked well on the whole, but she admitted the network signal was a problem. “We have to move the machine one or two kilometres to get the signal,” she said.Others have been known to take their customers to a hilly mound to get a signal for internet access. Residents in Lurgumi Kalan village in Mahuadanr, also in Jharkhand, went without rations for two months this summer because there was no connection, according to researchers at the campaign group Right To Food (RTF).Rice was distributed to the village only after one resident, 64-year-old Ramcharan Munda, died. Munda, who lived with his family in abject poverty in a small mud hut, had not eaten for two and a half days, activists found. Residents and the dealer had reportedly asked the administration on multiple times to revert to an offline system but this did not happen.Government officials issued a notice stating that if fingerprint scans failed, people should not be denied rations. But Ashrafi Nand Prasad, a state coordinator for RTF, said this message had not filtered down in many areas. “The local ration shop owners were not doing that,” he said. Like Manjhi, people were simply turned away with nothing.“Payments were always an issue and they were getting delayed even before Aadhaar, but one could see improvements happening for sure,” said Siraj Dutta, who works on social policy in Jharkhand. “With Aadhaar, everything went crazy and new problems came up.”Shrimati Devi, 70, who lives in Dumka, Jamma, said she had not received her 1,000-rupeesa-month pension for months. She eventually discovered that it was being paid to someone else’s bank account. Government staff told her to speak to the bank and the bank told her to speak to the inidual who was receiving her money.The problem of duplicate or fake cards, which Aadhaar promised to target, was actually “extremely negligible”, said Dutta. Corruption was happening elsewhere: grains were going missing before they reached the ration shop and dealers were fudging their records to suggest they had given plenty to customers, when actually some grains were held back.After Aadhaar was rolled out, the Jharkhand government claimed it had wiped out around 1m fake ration cards. Campaigners say many of those were genuine cards held by people who hadn’t successfully obtained an Aadhaar number and linked this to their card. A survey conducted by RTF found that of a sample of 135 cancelled ration cards, only two were declared fake and three deemed to be duplicates.Some were cancelled for not linking to Aadhaar or because the inidual had died, though the majority, 96, were scrapped without any explanation.Some states have chosen to supplement funds from central government to ensure vulnerable families are not left out Not Jharkhand, however, where some families are turned away or face long delays. Alabati Devi’s family are now getting the right support, although Kapi said they did not officially have the correct ration cards. Things changed after activists raised awareness of Manjhi’s death through the media.She expressed concern about other families in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha – India’s poorest states. “Where is the dignity in all this? These programmes have been put in place to allow people to live a life of dignity, and you are reducing them to beggars.”Additional reporting by Mohammad Sartaj Alam"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056ee7d0483c4d2c643b0fd903a846d428e40388/12_146_5501_3301/master/5501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f40bc2db78e578106dc0cbc31825b87","title":"limetown review a sub x files podcast to tv load of total tosh thanks facebook","story":"Jessica Biel plays a journalist called Haddock investigating the disappearance of 326 people from a town that housed a science facility. At least they’ll never have to watch this hokumThere is nothing I enjoy more – especially in metaphorically and literally dark times – than a high-concept, low-effort watch. Something that catches the attention and does not demand too much. Something that brings back fond memories of similar shows you can’t fully call to mind. That makes you go: “Ooh, this is a bit like that thing we liked! With that actor! And her that we like too! Set in a hotel. Or the woods? Or a hotel in the woods? Remember?” as you wriggle more deeply and comfortably into the sofa.Ladies and gentleman, I give you Limetown, from newcomer streaming servicelatest Zuckerberg tentacle to slide its way into our lives, Facebook Watch. Like the 2015 podcast from which it originated, Limetown tells the fictional story of Lia Haddock, a journalist determined to find out what happened to 326 people who vanished without a trace 15 years ago. They disappeared from the eponymous township that housed a scientific research facility, and where Dr Oskar Totem, a charismatic scientist, held out the promise of a utopian society brought about by people working on the sciencey research undertaken in the scientific research facility. Science!(There is no hint of an answer to the much greater mystery at Limetown’s heart: namely why, with all names in recorded history at their disposal, the creators decided to christen their protagonist Haddock. Maybe we will learn more if a second series is commissioned. I hope so.)One of the missing is Lia’s beloved uncle, played by Stanley Tucci. Lia is played by a bobbed Jessica Biel, whose beauty and star quality seem once again to have landed her a part unworthy of her considerable talents. At least Tucci ensures she is not alone. No one is in Limetown in service of anything more than the plot, which is so carefully designed to be addictive that you absolutely loathe yourself for falling victim to it. Puppets, all of us – mere puppets – dancing happily to the tune of pure hokum.All the notes are hit. A single distress call from the town on the day of the disappearance. A mysterious security firm barring entry to the emergency services. A network of caves under the town, apparently unused during the rapid exodus. No signs of panic or struggle – unless you count the charred body of Oscar, crucified on a lamp post. People engaging in fabulously redundant dialogue. Lia, standing by the lamp post 15 years later, notes that the Romans used this method of execution “to send a message”. “Awful, awful way to die,” replies her companion. “It was supposed to be,” says Lia. And on we go, having got nowhere.Then! Right on second-episode cue appears a woman, Winona (Kelly Jenrette), who claims to be one of the missing. But! Winona seems unstable and her memory is fragmentary. She can only recall seeing experiments in the facility suggestive of telepathy the initials SVLA an operation like one you might undergo if a cultish leader was inserting a microchip into your brain with – we must infer – malevolent intent and the fact that this is all she is allowed to say by another missing person with whom she is in contact. Lia deduces that the initials are in fact the name of the woman’s daughter, Sylvia, whom she does not remember at ALL – and that Something is definitely Afoot. It turns out that it’s one of those mass disappearances from scientific research laboratory-centred towns that you really have to worry about.The bulk of the action is actually a flashback, bookended by scenes of Lia trembling in her hotel room after this interview as a man stands outside yelling: “This is your warning!” and banging his head off her door. But Lia has come too far, too severely bobbed to give up now.Limetown is tosh of the highest quality. It has touches of Wayward Pines, second-tier X-Files episodes and that thing I can’t remember the name of but they all woke up in a hotel with no idea how they got there and unable to leave. You know? It had him and her from that thing in it. I am in for the duration, and happily so, but your mileage may vary, and I can’t say I would blame you if it did. They did, after all, choose to call her Lia Haddock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d89e018123818009dd8d960f771b00fd768011/1243_257_3377_2027/master/3377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2915d6e5b47a39c033fd292c9b90c70c","title":"regina king beale street watchmen superhero hbo dc comics oscar actor","story":"The Oscar-winner is playing a cape-swishing superhero in HBO’s revamp of the epic comic book. She talks wage gaps, wardrobe woes and her dreams of becoming a dentistRegina King had a hard time convincing some of her friends about Watchmen, her new HBO series inspired by the DC comic book of the same name and featuring the kind of details that make some people run for the exits: time travel, kung-fu fighting, masks and thinly veiled political allegory. “Girl, don’t do this,” said one friend. King could only smile and agree.But we would all do well to watch King – in anything. At 48, she is in her prime. While filming Watchmen, King won the best supporting actress  Oscar for  If Beale Street Could Talk, based on the James Baldwin novel. For years, she has been turning out quietly devastating portraits – in the movies Jerry Maguire and Ray, in the TV show Southland – with little public recognition. Now she has her pick of roles. “I appreciate winning the Oscar,” she says, “but that’s not the ultimate goal. I should be able to use it as currency moving forward.”King was not familiar with the original Watchmen material, nor the 2009 Zack Snyder movie (her 23-year-old son Ian is more excited about this role than any of King’s previous parts). But once she read the script, she was enthused. In Damon Lindelof’s adaptation, the tale’s 1950s cold-war storyline is spun into a look at the rise of a white supremacist group in a parallel US. King plays Angela Abar, a cop with superhuman fighting skills and an amazing French Lieutenant’s Woman-style cape: not the kind of part she usually gets.King, who in a New York hotel room is slight and smiling, powers through the series like a wrecking ball. She tuned into the fantasy landscape pretty quickly, even quibbling with wardrobe over the practicality of each costume. Originally, her mask was so cumbersome it seemed to defy even the tenuous reality of a comic-book tale. “I was like, ‘This is not good for the superhero peripheral! I can’t see if something’s coming – you have to tell me!’ So our wardrobe designer had a great idea: what if it was painted on?” It was hell on her skin, but it’s dynamite on screen.Lindelof was co-creator of Lost and the recent HBO hit The Leftovers. Watchmen has that same compelling narrative, the story of men with bamboo torches trying to eliminate black people. In the current climate, this parallel America feels very like the real thing. One of Lindelof’s triggers, says King, was Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2014 article for the Atlantic, The Case for Reparations, addressing the unacknowledged fall-out from slavery. She also cites “the way policing is happening here in the States with, particularly, black men.” To this end, Watchmen is, oddly, of a piece with Beale Street, Baldwin’s exposé of the split-screen reality in the US between white people and people of colour – although Watchmen doesn’t seem expressly political to King. With a laugh, she says: “Being black, it’s part of my life. What’s happened is that Trump has just emboldened people. They were always there, feeling the way they’ve been feeling, but now, oh my gosh. There are a lot of people – white friends I have – who have had this wedge in their families. They knew maybe a family member was a little less progressive, but whoa! Now they’re finding out their views were so far apart.”Meanwhile, the idea of white supremacy as a guerrilla force is not exactly fantastical, given the extent such militias play in US history. “It’s easy to pretend that something didn’t exist if you’re not talking about it,” says King. “Within our community, yes, we’re talking about it all the time, because we’re living it generation to generation. But for a lot of white Americans, ignorance is bliss. For them.”King grew up in California, and wanted to be a dentist. This was not a passing phase. She loved going to her dentist so much, it seemed for many years to be the only possible career path. “I would always hear horror stories about the dentist, but not mine. His dental assistant was his wife, Babe, and she had this white hair that looked like cotton candy. I always looked forward to going. I’d floss to impress him. He made the experience fun. He made me understand how important your periodontal situation is.” She bursts out laughing. “He had a great set of teeth and Babe had a great set of teeth! So whenever I would see people without a great set of teeth I’d be like, ‘Ew!’”Don’t ever live in Britain, I say. “Yeah, I know.” Again she hoots with laughter. “Not a lot of good teeth there.”King had acted in school, but it wasn’t until she got to theUniversity of Southern California that it became clear to her not only that dental work wasn’t in her future, but that what she should do was drop out to act. It amazes her now that she made this decision with “no information to back it up”. She simply knew it was the right thing to do, a strong intuition foreshadowing a steeliness that would become apparent 30 years later in her most famous roles. Her parents weren’t happy. “My mom is a teacher and showed her disappointment,” she says, “but not enough that it made me decide to go back.”She was so young and inexperienced that for years, in roles she took in movies such as Boyz N the Hood and Mighty Joe Young, she had no idea of pay scale, or whether she was receiving a fair income relative to others on set. “I wasn’t focused on that,” she says. “It wasn’t until I was in my 30s that I even stopped to consider the wage gap. It was something as simple as hearing a male actor say something – either about his per diem, or something else – and I was like, ‘Wait! Hold up – my part is way bigger than yours.’” No one talked about it in the early days? “Well, things have been designed so that we don’t.”King has been a supporter of Time’s Up, the campaign to equalise pay and conditions for women in Hollywood. “That’s why this is a pretty exciting time. If I’m blessed enough to have a granddaughter, she’ll come in knowing this is how it’s going to be. I feel like it’s diminishing it by calling it a movement. It’s witnessing a shift, a life change. That’s how I look at it.”Crucially, she says, expectations have changed: there’s a suspicion that, just as sexual harassment will come back to bite you, so will pay differences. “No one wants their filthy past, their dirty little secret, to come out. A lot of people in these positions of power – white men – don’t even realise it was a problem, or something you should feel embarrassed about.”King is glad she had a lot of solid success before she won the Oscar, playing supporting roles in big movies. “I’ve heard people say, ‘Oh, you were robbed with Jerry Maguire, or Ray.’ But I don’t think I would’ve had an appreciation for the art, in the way I do, if it had happened earlier.”Beale Street was a different experience. “Oh, gosh,” says King, who found it so personal that talking about it still makes her emotional. Astonishingly, it was the first movie adaptation of a Baldwin novel, a film that remained a quiet, literary piece despite the starriness of its cast – and of its director, Barry Jenkins, fresh from his Oscar win for Moonlight the previous year. For King, who played Sharon Rivers, the mother of a young woman whose fiance is wrongly imprisoned for rape, it was everything: a love story, an indictment of the criminal justice system, and part of the vast, untold history of black life in the US. “We’re in a time when film is so loud and the audience is looking for shocking. It’s hard to convince people that there is an audience out there that wants quiet stories.”So does she feel in her prime? “For the most part, body-wise, I don’t feel different than when I was in my 20s,” she says. “Only when I hurt something, because it takes so long to get back. But the wisdom and regard for what’s important is different now. In my 20s, that I-don’t-give-a-fuck attitude is great. It helps you go out on a ledge and let your feet dangle down and not even think about it.”Still, it is nothing compared with the thrill of having better judgment: “Being in your 40s and having the wherewithal to know, ‘Yeah, maybe not that ledge.’” She roars with laughter.• Watchmen is on HBO in the US from 20 October and on Sky Atlantic and Now TV in the UK from 21 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae43ec314809088f1a264a41a5ecdcf286380a55/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0de936dc98567794b10787a69a583871","title":"british family deported after saying they accidentally crossed us border","story":"Family of seven were detained for nearly two weeks after crossing into Washington state, saying they were trying to avoid an animal in the roadLawyers for a British family who made an unauthorized crossing from Canada into the United States say the family have been deported after nearly two weeks in federal custody.Bridget Cambria says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told her all seven members of the family, including an infant and toddler twins, were headed back to England.

Giuliani, the former New York mayor, is Trump’s personal lawyer.All the other defendants in the case were already in custody.Prosecutors said Correia, who owns a home with his wife in West Palm Beach, was part of efforts by co-defendants Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to leverage outsized political donations to Republican candidates and committees as part of an effort to advance their business interests.Both Parnas and Fruman have a history of business dealings with Giuliani.Prosecutors said that, among other things, the pair made campaign contributions with the intent of lobbying US politicians to oust the country’s ambassador to Ukraine. At the time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump’s potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.Correia is accused of conspiring with the other defendants, including Ukrainian-born US citizen Andrey Kukushkin, to make political donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.All four defendants were expected to appear on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan.Separately, the investigation into Giuliani’s Ukrainian business dealings are reported to have triggered a broader set of counterintelligence concerns within the FBI than previously known, CNN has reported.Kenneth McCallion, a New York lawyer who has represented several Ukrainian clients including former Ukraine prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, has said counterintelligence agents approached him asking about Giuliani’s ties to Parnas and Fruman earlier this year.The investigation is understood to focus on possible foreign influence operations designed to take advantage of Giuliani’s Ukrainian ties to make inroads with the White House.“I was just asked whether I or any of my clients knew of any dealings that these two guys had with Giuliani,” McCallion told the network. “They were on the radar with regard to possible counterintelligence issues.McCallion added that he “was asked a lot of questions by FBI and other counterintelligence investigators who were looking at Giuliani’s comings and goings in Ukraine and business dealings”.Giuliani, who has said Parnas and Fruman are his clients, has said he had “no such knowledge” of a federal inquiry involving him.Correia, the fourth man arrested in the investigation, is listed as the registered agent for a Florida corporation tied to a series of wire transfers prosecutors allege was part of an elaborate effort to hide the true source of funds used to make the donations.He posed with then congressman Pete Sessions in a 2018 photo taken inside the Texas Republican’s Capitol Hill office that Parnas posted on social media with the caption “Hard at work !!”The Associated Press reported last week that Sessions fits the description in the indictment of a congressman who prosecutors allege was part of a coordinated effort to remove the US ambassador to Ukraine.The arrest comes as a former top aide to secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told impeachment investigators on Wednesday that he resigned because he was upset that the Trump administration had overridden Ukraine policy.McKinley is the latest in a string of diplomats and officials who have described to impeachment investigators that they pushed aside as Trump exercised his own agenda on Ukraine, including efforts to have former vice-president Joe Biden and his son investigated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25d1b3ab1e5e550b93e62cf1dc018426ddc2842/0_102_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d679b70c2205295d2e07dc467967f2d","title":"iran to limit inspectors access to its nuclear facilities","story":"Move announced by senior MPs represents another step away from nuclear deal signed in 2015Iran will further reduce its commitment to the nuclear deal signed with world powers by limiting international inspectors’ access to its nuclear sites, senior Iranian MPs have said.The move, which is expected to take place at the beginning of November, will be the fourth Iranian step away from the deal, and puts pressure on France, Germany and the UK to make some form of counter-move.The joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 but Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018, placing pressure on Europe to prove to Iran it was worth sticking with the deal.On Wednesday, the spokesman for the Iranian parliament’s national security committee, Hossein Naghavi-Hosseini, said: “In the fourth step of reducing JCPOA commitments, we will probably impose limits on inspections, which means the International Atomic Energy Agency’s surveillance on Iran’s nuclear activities will be reduced.”He added: “When the other party doesn’t fulfil its commitments, there is no necessity for us to meet our part of commitments.“We will certainly take the fourth step of reducing commitments to the JCPOA Europeans have not honoured their part of the commitments and we have not seen any practical step taken by the other side.”On Monday the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said Tehran was working on advanced IR-9 centrifuges for uranium enrichment. Those centrifuges do not appear in the 2015 accord.The French foreign ministry publicly urged Iran not to take what it said would be “particularly worrying steps”.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Iran has justified the step by step reduction in its commitment by pointing to the EU’s inability to make good on its promises to increase trade between Iran and Europe. In July, Iran abandoned two of its commitments under the deal by allowing its stockpile of enriched uranium to exceed the 300kg limit and breaching the cap on the purity of its uranium stocks.The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, earlier this month told the French parliament’s foreign affairs committee it was up to Iran to pick up the proposals his country sought to broker at the UN general assembly in New York last month.Tensions between France and Iran have risen after the Iranian intelligence agencies captured an Iranian exile based in Paris, Rouhollah Zam, who had led a media campaign against the government. He was captured in Jordan this week on his way to Baghdad.France has also disclosed that Iran has detained Roland Marchal, a senior researcher from Sciences Po University in Paris, since June.The tensions came as the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said one or more foreign powers were behind the missile attack on an Iranian tanker in the Red Sea last week. Despite the bellicose rhetoric, Iran is exploring if there is room for mediation with Saudi Arabia, after Donald Trump’s withdrawal from Syria and his refusal to take military action against Iran in the wake of the September missile attacks on the Aramco Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aac0fe8e2088e633452f55aa5276d389b5023e5a/0_128_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f053e9a62b07ce61648687507bffdea","title":"mormon church strikes blow against utah ban on conversion therapy","story":"Church says rule prohibiting psychologists from using LGBTQ conversion therapy would fail to safeguard ‘religious beliefs’A proposed LGBTQ conversion therapy ban in Utah is in danger of being derailed after the Church of Jesus of Christ of Latter-day Saints came out Tuesday night in opposition, just months after it said it wouldn’t stand in the way of a similar measure under consideration.The church said the regulatory rule prohibiting Utah psychologists from engaging in LBGTQ conversion therapy with minors would fail to safeguard “religious beliefs” and doesn’t account for “important realities of gender identity in the development of children”.State regulators crafted the rule at the request of Republican governor, Gary Herbert, a member of the church, who in June asked for a set of rules after a similar bill died in the legislature despite the church not taking a position.The church’s statement strikes a blow to the hopes of LGBTQ advocates hoping Utah could join 18 states that have enacted laws banning or restricting conversion therapy that’s opposed by the American Psychological Association.The faith widely known as the Mormon church accounts for nearly two-thirds of the state’s residents, and nearly every state lawmaker. It’s unknown how the church’s position will impact the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing’s pending decision. The agency has said the rule could go into effect as early as next week.The ision didn’t immediately respond to inquiries Wednesday.Troy Williams, executive director of the LGBTQ rights group Equality Utah, said he is surprised by the church’s stance since the rule was already revised to align with the failed legislation. His group is reaching out the church to see if more changes could be made to address its concerns while keeping the substance intact.“We do not treat gender dysphoria with conversion therapy, that is dangerous and unethical,” said Williams, pointing to research linking “identity conversion efforts” to increased odds of suicide attempts among transgender adults.The church said it denounces any “abusive” treatment and that it “hopes that those who experience same-sex attraction and gender dysphoria find compassion and understanding from family members”.The opposition comes after one of the religion’s top leaders, Dallin H Oaks, said this month that a person’s gender assigned at birth is “essential to the plan of salvation” and that they don’t know “why same-sex attraction and confusion about sexual identity occur”.His remarks were reminiscent of a time in the 1970s when church scholars say the faith taught that homosexuality could be “cured”. The church has since said homosexuality is not a sin, though it remains opposed to same-sex marriage and intimacy.At the public hearing last month, opponents of the proposal argued the rule would prevent parents from getting help for their children with “unwanted” homosexual feelings or even from talking about sexuality. Most of the opponents came from conservative-based groups.A parade of LGBTQ people urged the board to adopt the rule.Nathan Dalley, 20, said he grew up a member of the faith and went through conversion therapy shortly after he turned 16. He said he was told to snap a rubber band on his wrist every time he felt attracted to men, and a therapist also scrutinized his posture, his walk, his gestures and interests. The experience deepened his feelings of depression and culminated in a suicide attempt.“It takes all these insecurities you have about yourself ... and convinces you they’re accurate,” he said Wednesday. He said church leaders haven’t followed through on their position of neutrality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f239060cf8166af1d3c84c967befefbcd9c3a245/0_128_4287_2573/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad1352cd2910307166aa0a4406a0260d","title":"obama justin trudeau canada election","story":"Canadian PM responds with ‘Thanks my friend’ after Obama gives apparently unprecedented endorsement by former US presidentBarack Obama has urged Canadians to re-elect Justin Trudeau, an apparently unprecedented endorsement of a candidate in a Canadian election by a former American president.Obama tweeted on Wednesday that he was proud to work with Trudeau and described him as a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change.“The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term,” Obama wrote.Trudeau later responded with his own tweet: “Thanks my friend, we’re working hard to keep our progress going.”Trudeau is in a tough re-election fight before Monday’s parliamentary elections.Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said that might have something to do with Obama’s intervention.“Trudeau is in real danger,” Bothwell said. “If I were a Liberal (party) campaigner I would quietly point with pride to Obama’s endorsement. I don’t know if I’d run around toting it as a major political issue.”Bothwell said you would have to go back more than 100 years to find an American president intervening in a Canadian federal election.He said Theodore Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, visited Toronto in 1917 when Canada was having an election about conscription and spoke in favor of it.Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, called Obama’s endorsement rare and said it possibly has not happened before but he doesn’t think it will move the polls.“In fact, some people may feel this is an unwarranted foreign intrusion in Canada’s election,” Wiseman said.Obama also endorsed Emmanuel Macron for president in France’s 2017 election, and he warned British voters against backing leaving the European Union.Trudeau formed a close relationship with Obama when he was president and the two were pictured having dinner in Ottawa earlier this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3bdeca1cba402b0a2529d136c9052da3dcff264/0_0_4456_3038/master/4456.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=10542e8d4b08ebb026c09b415f6c8681","title":"could you be an adoptive parent","story":"What does it take to raise a child who has been adopted? We asked adoptive parents to share their advice“You don’t have to be a superhero,” says Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of the charity Adoption UK, the leading voice of adoptive families.Armstrong Brown believes that many of the characteristics adoptive parents require are the same as those all parents need. “Warmth, openness and a willingness to accept the unknown are key,” she says. “Adopters need to be emotionally mature, have resilience and problem-solving skills and the ability to prioritise family relationships. And a good sense of humour is essential.”Adopted children’s early experiences mean they can often struggle with relationships and day-to-day life. Many have suffered abuse or neglect, all have been separated from their birth families and most have spent time in the care system. They need love, understanding and patience to help them overcome their difficulties and go on to lead confident, happy lives.Although it can be challenging, being an adoptive parent is also hugely rewarding and adopters provide some of the UK’s most vulnerable children with the stable homes they so desperately need.Heather and her husband, Dan, adopted Miles 15 months ago when he was just over a year old. Heather considers empathy to be the most important quality in an adoptive parent. “That is probably the biggest one,” she says. “Really understanding where children are coming from.“I think it’s important being able to admit to them if you don’t get something right,” Heather continues. “Adopted children can mistrust adults even if they don’t know where that comes from. Some have never had an adult meet their basic needs.”Dan and Heather were an “adoption first” couple, meaning that they had not experienced infertility, but went straight for adoption to start their family.“At the time, I was working with children who were in care, and for some of the children their plan was adoption. It didn’t feel right to us as a couple to have a baby when we knew so many children were waiting for families,” says Heather.The fact that she was already working in nurseries and children’s centres meant that there was no mystique for her around adoption. Dan had his reservations at first but once he went to a group for prospective adopters, those feelings disappeared.“He realised they were just children, there was nothing to be frightened of. They just needed a stable, loving home,” Heather says.They also knew they had to work together as a couple, supporting each other, being flexible and communicating about any challenges. “The challenges that adoptive children bring are the same as for all children, but the approach has to be different,” she says. “Miles sometimes struggles with separation so it’s about building up trust.”Tanya Killick is a project worker at Adopteens, an online community for adopted young people aged 11 to 18 living in Yorkshire and the Humber region. She believes adopters with teenagers should be open to exploring their children’s pasts. “It’s about flexibility around the teenagers’ emotional needs,” she says. “An understanding of where they have come from is crucial in helping them form a strong sense of their own identity.”Education poses many challenges to adopted children and their families. While GCSEs, A-levels, and going to college can be stressful for many young people, those who are adopted can find these life stages even more difficult. “They need a lot more support in school,” says Killick. “Adoption is not just a point in time, it is a part of you forever.”Claire is a single adoptive parent from north-east England who has two daughters, now aged five-and-a-half and three. She was in her early 30s when she first thought about adopting. “I felt ready to have kids and wasn’t in a relationship at the time. One of my parents was adopted, so it was something that I grew up with. It just seemed like the right way to do it.”When she began to research adoption, she realised many of the children in the looked-after system had been exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. Claire made the conscious decision to openly accept that and look for sources of support after she had adopted. Both her children have foetal alcohol syndrome and have benefited from specialist therapies. Claire has been able to deal with the resulting challenges as they arise. “It just requires thinking in a different way, a different sort of parenting,” she says.Armstrong Brown reiterates that adoption can be uniquely fulfilling. “Adoptive parents find they have a deep love for their children that really enhances their lives, despite the challenges,” she says.“If you are interested, and feel drawn to adopt, just make an enquiry – it doesn’t commit you to anything.”If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit first4adoption.org.ukyoucanadopt"},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will bePreparation can help you take full advantage of open day opportunities"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"CUH part of global trial of cheap, easy to administer drug that reduces brain bleedsCaranua says \u0026euro110m survivors\u0027 fund is almost spent, despite \u0026euro3m owed by Christian BrothersDundalk woman and her child are believed to be in custody of Turkish-backed militiaCouncillors hear of efforts to protect staff as they condemn extortion at building sitesQuestions raised over whether Boris Johnson will sign up to new deal amid consent worriesFor both mathematics and poetry, the \u0026lsquoless is more\u0026rsquo principle often appliesTaoiseach defends funding levels as FF leader says hundreds are going without helpThe health impacts are already at crisis levels in the most vulnerable countriesMinister expresses concerns over the draft legislation as Seanad votes to pass itSchools struggling to attract applicants for vacant positions, representative group saysGerard Craughwell (Ind) and Catherine Noone (FG) were speaking during a Seanad debateChildren of the Troubles by Joe Duffy and Freya McClements launched in DublinGovernment has yet to produce National Clean Air Strategy\u0026lsquoBasic foundations\u0026rsquo of agreement ready ahead of summit of EU leaders, says TuskVictim was lured to scene of attack through Grindr app and beaten with hammersTaoiseach says \u0026rsquopetition of concern\u0026rsquo giving veto to one community needs to changeMan is due to go on trial in 2020 for murder of two men and attempted murder of four othersSpokesman for terrorist group says Border infrastructure would be \u0026lsquolegitimate target\u0026rsquoVictim (41), who was with his young child, sustained non-life threatening injuries in incident"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4053031.1571250961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"girl 9 with intellectual disability brought to a e due to services gap","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHazel Murray (9) from Aghabullogue, Co Cork.The mother of a nine-year-old girl with an intellectual disability and behavioural problems who has twice been refused a home care support package has spoken of having to go to a hospital emergency department in desperation when she was unable to manage her child.Nuala Murray from Aghabullogue, Co Cork said “I felt a failure as a mom” when she turned to Cork University Hospital (CUH) for help two months ago.Her daughter Hazel , who has autism and engages in self-harming behaviour like banging her head, “had a huge meltdown” in a restaurant in Killarney, Co Kerry.“I was on my own. I had a bit of a cry. My beautiful little girl... I couldn’t manage her.”The married mother of two said she always tried to “keep the brighter side out” but she hit a wall every six months or so, and had a path worn to the door of her GP in Coachford.Organisations like the Cope Foundation, which on Wednesday warned of an unprecedented demand for its services, did amazing work but their resources were completely over stretched, she said.The dental nurse has reduced her workdays and at one point had to take six weeks leave as she was so burned out.“I just need a guarantee that we won’t be alone - that the services will be there,” she said.Ms Murray said being turned down for home care was a huge blow. She was told packages were only available for families in crisis but “I think we are a family in a crisis. We do need the best service possible for Hazel.”She said her family was hugely grateful for the assistance of the early intervention team in Cope.“My daughter wouldn’t be walking only for them. She reached milestones we didn’t think she would achieve.”But she worries constantly about Hazel. “What would happen if my child died because of lack of services when she is banging her head. Who would pick up the pieces for me if that happened?”Ultimately, she says she wants some peace of mind.“My daughter is with me long term. She is my baby and will be with me forever.“I don’t want to take away the personality of my daughter. I just wish that things were a little easier for us and her.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4052968.1571254916!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"syrian group claiming to hold lisa smith attempts to sell interviews with her","story":"A group claiming to have custody of Irish Islamic State supporter Lisa Smith and her child is attempting to sell interviews with her to media outlets, The  understands.Ms Smith (38) and her two-year-old daughter are believed to have escaped from the Ain Issa camp last weekend where she was being detained with about 950 other wives and children of Islamic State fighters.The women and children fled the camp after it came under attack from Turkish warplanes as Turkey’s military invaded northern Syria seeking to drive back the mainly Kurdish Syrian Defence Force (SDF).The Department of Foreign Affairs does not know the current location of Ms Smith but is aware of reports that she is in the custody of a group called the Syrian National Army (SNA), also known as the Free Syrian army, which is fighting on the side of Turkish forces.The SNA is made up of various factions including Islamic extremists and soldiers who defected from the Syrian military. Sources say the department has been made aware that a person claiming to represent the group has contacted media outlets, including at least one media outlet in Ireland, offering to sell an interview with Ms Smith for a “substantial” sum of money.It is understood the Irish media outlet refused to pay over any money. A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Wednesday.According to the Daily  newspaper, Ms Smith and her child are being held in a village on the outskirts of Tel Abyad along with UK woman, Tooba Gondal (25), who is alleged to have acted as a recruiter for the Islamic State, also known as Isis. The village, which is located on the Syria-Turkey border about 45km from Ain Issa, was recently taken by Turkish-backed forces.Ms Smith, Ms Gondal and their children were picked up by FSA fighters after fleeing fighting in the camp, it said.The  reported that Ms Gondal has told her family in London that she and her two children are being held with Ms Smith in a “safehouse” after fleeing violence in the Ain Issa camp.The SNA may hand Ms Smith over to the Turkish authorities directing their operations for trial or deportation to Ireland. If Ms Smith and her child are brought to Turkish territory it would make it significantly easier for the Irish authorities to facilitate her return. However the Department of Foreign Affairs are concerned the group may instead demand a ransom for Ms Smith and her child. Factions of the SNA have a history of demanding large ransoms for prisoners, including westerners.The Irish government has previously said Ms Smith will be permitted to return home but a Department of Foreign Affairs source said travel documentation has yet to be issued to facilitate this.Last week, the Garda confirmed Ms Smith is being investigated under the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, which prohibits membership of domestic and foreign terrorist groups.As a former member of the Irish Air Corps, Ms Smith was a flight attendant on the government jet, and worked as a driver for senior officers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4053134.1571258820!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord d%C3%A1il exchanges turn snappy amid election heebie jeebies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar, perhaps getting some Brexit frustration out of his system or maybe imagining what it must be like to be on the verge of calling a snap election, continued on the offensive. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsLittle bundles of joy at every turn in Leinster House.Aaah, would you look at them.TDs of all persuasion walking the corridors cradling their newly arrived little bundles of smiley-faced joy. Honestly, who could resist those needy, trust-me eyes looking out at you?Definitely not the TDs.All any of them really want to do is sink their faces into that magical freshness and deeply inhale the sweet fragrance of their newborn election leaflets. Which they most likely do, when no one is watching.Their glowing portraits of airbrushed sincerity swaddled in bullet points and “know your entitlements” tables are ready to go out there now and face the big, bad world. They’ve been flying off the printing machines all week and flying out of Leinster House in ever-increasing bundles.Soon it will be time to let them go for ever.No prizes for guessing it’s all Brexit’s fault, because it is.The Taoiseach may protest otherwise, but few are taking any chances. Talk of an election next month hasn’t abated one little bit. So what if it might not happen? Better to be prepared than caught on the hop.The more the speculation grows, the worse the TDs get. Even though Leo Varadkar is falling over himself to deny he has ever entertained impure thoughts about November, even his own Fine Gael foot soldiers are up in the air with anticipation. It’s the nature of the beast. The heebie-jeebies have taken over on Kildare Street.But it’s entertaining listening to experienced politicians outline the reasons why, in their considered opinion, Leo will not call a snap election this side of Christmas before they talk themselves around to the view that Leo would be mad not to call a snap election if he gets a decent Brexit outcome and “what are you hearing yourself, how do you think it will go?”Bunged upAll day and into the night on Wednesday, with the EU and UK negotiators wedged like a cork up their Brexit talks tunnel, occasional updates escaped from the business end of the bung to torment the jitterers.Many are comforting themselves in this time of uncertainty by admiring their campaign merchandise. All sorts of gimmicks and gee-gaws can be branded these days. Our current favourite is Declan “Dáil Representative for Louth \u0026amp Coastal Meath” Breathnach’s calling card. Nice photo on a green background with all his contact details on the back taking up so much room there isn’t any space left for a mention of Fianna Fáil.It may look like an average card, but when you push a little button in the back of Declan’s head, a light comes on. Apparently Micheál has to do this in real life with quite a few of his backbenchers.Speaking of the Fianna Fáil leader, he isn’t holding with any of this election talk either. Just like the man whose job he’s after, Micheál is remaining aloof from such talk.Neither has he any intention of dirtying his Brexit green jersey to get one over on the Government. In fact, there is precious little return for him in even mentioning the blasted thing. Criticism of the Taoiseach and his team at this crucial phase of negotiations would not be a good look. The Fianna Fáil leader doesn’t want to be complicit in burnishing Leo’s Brexit halo. It only takes away from his own shine.Best to steer clear of the subject altogether during Leaders’ Questions. It can be discussed in a more neutral setting later at the less confrontational session of questions to the Taoiseach on matters relating to his department.So Micheál has been niggling Leo over social issues instead, excoriating his Government for its record on health and housing in particular. The Taoiseach doesn’t like it. He hits back, usually by reciting a list of his administration’s achievements. Whereupon Micheál lambastes him for trying to score political points using hugely sensitive issues, thereby trying to bag some political points for himself in the process.Then Leo accuses his opposite number, whose party is sustaining his party in power, of political point-scoring.Au contraire, goads Micheál, you’re the one doing that.With varying degrees of success depending on the day, the pair of them studiously effect to remain above the vulgar fray.Micheál swoopsThe Fianna Fáil leader swooped from the high moral ground on Wednesday, rounding on the Taoiseach for what he saw as a lack concern for people with disabilities. He instanced the funding problems of the Cope Foundation in Cork to drive home his point.“You’re just not delivering as a government on disability, Taoiseach,” he thundered. “You’ve got to change tack in relation to delivering to people with disability.”As the Minister for Health clucked his disapproval from the front bench, Micheál told a frowning Leo to “Talk to families. Engage with families. You’re in denial.”The Taoiseach wasn’t going to take that. Not for the first time – “a bit like yesterday” – the leader of the Opposition was trying to “misrepresent and mischaracterise my response in order to score political points and make yourself look good”.“Hear hear!” they cried on the Government side.“That is not true,” bridled Micheál.“It is exactly true, and I think it’s disappointing,” sniffed Leo. And a further “truth” is that the Cope Foundation does “fabulous work” and “has received budget increases in the last number of years and is getting another one next year”.“The other truth is that when you were in government, you cut the budget for disability services, you cut the disability allowance,” fumed the Taoiseach, stung by the criticism.“You’re no friend of people with disabilities. Your record on disability is appalling,” he shouted across at mild-mannered Micheál, stabbing his finger in his direction.On the offensiveThe Fianna Fáil leader looked a bit taken aback, in a slightly satisfied way. “You should talk to people in the disability sector about my record,” he countered.But the Taoiseach, perhaps getting some Brexit frustration out of his system or maybe imagining what it must be like to be on the verge of calling a snap election, continued on the offensive.“You should be ashamed of your record when it comes to disability and not be so self-righteous in this House. Ashamed of yourself. Ashamed!”He sat down with thump to a cacophony of supportive and outraged roars.“G’wan, go check it out now,” insisted Micheál, in his high-pitched Angry of Cork tone. His Fianna Fáil colleagues pitched in with a noisy litany of complaints.The Taoiseach retaliated. “Fianna Fáil cut the disability allowance. You should be ashamed of how you treated people with disabilities.”“Would you to calm down a little bit please,” sighed the Ceann Comhairle. C’mere, please, pleeease.”“Ashamed,” repeated Leo into the growing din.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghail knew what was going on. It was a full-blown manifestation of the election rumour heebie-jeebies.“The whistle hasn’t been blown yet, so will ye calm down.”But both teams are very much out on the pitch and warming up in earnest.If the ball isn’t thrown in soon, they’ll be burnt out by Christmas.Matron, more leaflets!"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit deal latest news: Donald Tusk says deal is ready, but there are \u0026#39certain doubts on the British side\u0026#39 UCL to ban crisp packets and petri dishes in crackdown on single-use plasticCatalan leader appeals for calm as protesters clash with police and set fires in BarcelonaMillions may be taking statins unnecessarily, study suggestsWorld\u0026#39s fastest ant revealed as Saharan insect more nimble than a CheetahMP Louise Ellman quits Labour after 55 years, because Corbyn is \u0026#39not fit to serve as our Prime Minister\u0026#39Boris Johnson has youth on his side in opinion poll as 18-24 group pick PM over Jeremy CorbynComment: We must get Brexit done and deliver growth as the world enters a new, uncertain eraBBC under fire as 1.7 million pensioners will feel squeeze of TV licence cutFate of Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit deal passes to MPs after the EU says agreement has almost been reachedAQA could face class action suit from parents of children who were possibly given \u0026#39incorrect\u0026#39 gradesMystery deepens over Oxford academic accused of illegally selling bible fragments to USComment: This may be Leavers\u0026#39 last, realistic chance to achieve a proper BrexitPublisher of Booker Prize nominee criticises judging after jury member suggests award was to celebrate Margaret Atwood\u0026#39s \u0026#39titanic career\u0026#39Dog thieves are not being pursued by police as £500 rule leaves pets languishing as low priority, say campaignersFormer deputy leader of SNP says Nicola Sturgeon is wrong to call for indyref2 next year How Boris Johnson sought to redeem Brexit and win over the DUP, Cabinet and backbenchersFather of Sandy Hook victim awarded $450,000 in case against conspiracy theorist who claims tragedy never happenedMystery as plane carrying Russian arms smugglers crashes in CongoComment: The PM\u0026#39s \u0026#39great Brexit gamble\u0026#39 on sticky fudge over noble delay could be about to backfireWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/17/method-composite.jpg","title":"actors method roles crazy joker joaquin phoenix charlize theron list","story":"Subscribe nowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.For some actors, dedication to their craft knows no bounds.There has been a long history of performers who have got so stuck into their roles that they’ve taken things too far, whether they’ve injured themselves or frightened their co-stars on set.While method acting is considered a technique adopted by the greatest actors, there have been many examples of such instances where reining it in could have been beneficial.It won\u0027t be much of a surprise to see certain names here – Daniel Day-Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix are indeed included – but others (Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher, for example) may make you look twiceBelow is a compilation of 21 actors who took certain roles\u0026nbspso seriously things\u0026nbspgot out of hand.Created with Sketch.21 actors who took their roles so seriously it got out of hand Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011). Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track.

Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film.

The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016\u0027s Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew.Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family.

Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together.

Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.When will Apple TV+ launch?\u0026nbspApple TV+ will be available\u0026nbspin over 100 countries, including the UK, on 1 November.\u0026nbspTo subscribe to Apple TV+, users will need to have iOS 12.3 or later, tvOS 12.3 or later and macOS Catalina.\u0026nbspApple TV+ will cost £4.99 a month in the UK and $4.99 in the US for a family package, coming with a seven-day free trial starting on 1 November.Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon to earn $40m from new TV seriesNetflix to spend $500m on new UK-made films and TV showsPrince Harry and Oprah to partner on mental health series for Apple TVCustomers who purchase any iPhone,\u0026nbspiPad, Apple TV, iPod touch or Mac after 10 September are\u0026nbspofferd\u0026nbspone year of Apple TV+ for free.Through Family Sharing, up to six people can share one Apple TV+ subscription.Which TV shows and films will be available to stream on Apple TV+?The service will include a range of original Apple series, with one of the first being The Morning Show, which stars\u0026nbspJennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.It was recently revealed that Aniston and Witherspoon will earn $2m per episode.\u0026nbspSee, meanwhile, is a science fiction series set 600 years in the future featuring Jason Momoa\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspFor All Mankind\u0026nbspis an alternate history of the moon landings.In December, mystery drama Truth Be Told starring Octavia Spencer and Aaron Paul will land on the platform.

The UK company blamed its “disappointing” performance on the challenges of expanding both in the US and the EU simultaneously.“With the benefit of hindsight, we were not adequately prepared for the additional complexities of planning and trading across our expanded warehouse footprint,” Asos said in a statement, adding that it lost focus on some of its core tasks. \u0026nbspCaroline Gulliver, a retail analyst at Jefferies, made a similar assessment.“The complications of trying to do both projects at the same time meant they took their eye off the ball with regards to being best in class for products and fashion and customer experience in the UK and globally,” she said.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ms Gulliver contrasted the performance of Asos with rival Boohoo, which reported a more than 80 per cent jump in pre-tax profit in the six months ending in August.“Boohoo is very, very focused on having a good product, very focused on what the customer wants to wear, supplying it at a really competitive price,” she said.Asos acknowledged shoppers’ growing appetite for bargains, noting\u0026nbspthat the UK market has been “more promotionally intense” over the last year –\u0026nbspsomething that, it suggested, may affect future profits as well.“We will also watch consumer confidence carefully, particularly in the context of Brexit,” the retailer added.There are already signs consumers are becoming more cautious.

Net revenue at Goldman’s investing and lending ision slumped 40 per cent as it swallowed a loss of about $80m (£63m) on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company, along with hits from investments in Uber and two other companies.The valuation of WeWork, an office-sharing startup, has plummeted from a peak of $47bn in January to as low as $10-12bn, forcing it to pull its IPO.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will also be worn by the first ever woman to walk on the Moon, who will head there as part of the Artemis mission.Nasa unveiled two prototypes, one white model designed for exploring outside of the spacecraft on spacewalks, and a second orange suit for high-risk activity on the inside, such as launch and returning to Earth.Amy Ross, a spacesuit engineer, said the new Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) for outside use has been made more flexible than before, making it easier for astronauts to move and bend.It is so flexible that it allows users to put their arms overhead, something astronauts during the Apollo programme were not able to do.\u0026nbspZippers are bad and cables are bad so we have no zippers or cables on this suit, she explained at a demonstration held in Washington DC.There will be fewer seams and new materials that keep the dust out.We found evidence of life on Mars in the 1970s, former Nasa scientistIt also features new technology to better manage pressure and the gloves have been improved to allow greater dexterity.You\u0027ll remember, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, they bunny hopped on the surface of the moon, well now we\u0027re actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different than our suits of the past, said Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine.The Orion suit used for launch and entry is made from fire resistant material and features a lighter and stronger helmet, with improvements to reduce noise.Nasa is aiming to put the the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024 and maintain a presence with an ISS-like gateway orbiting around it, in hopes of eventually moving further into space to Mars.Kenneth Bowersox, acting associate administrator for human exploration, recently cast some doubt on the target date for the Artemis missions to the moon, saying he would not bet anything on it.Funding and technical challenges still need to come together in order to meet the White House-set deadline, the former space shuttle and space station commander told a congressional subcommittee last month.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year\u0026nbsphe shut down\u0026nbsphis company\u0027s Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\u0026nbspaccounts and said Wetherspoon was going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business.It’s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion, he added.The author of the parody Tim Martin perhaps came to the same conclusion: the account has been dormant for more than 18 months.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the opportunity arises I would buy new trains on more favourable terms, but we will inherit a leasing arrangement that will be sustained for some time to come, and I have never said anything other than that.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The cost of purchasing rolling stock is a fraction of the £196 billion and was included as that is what full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry would likely involve. If a Labour government chose not to purchase the rolling stock, they would still need to pay the cost of leasing them.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It had yellowish brown fur, powerful jaws and a pouch for its young like a kangaroo.Among eight sightings in the past three years was one from a couple from Western Australia visiting the island of Tasmania in February, who said they saw one of the creatures crossing the road.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

The Syrian government is hostile to foreign\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspand many remain at risk of arrest.International aid and medical agencies, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and DanChurchAid, all released statements saying their intentional staff had\u0026nbspto leave Syria, either partially or fully halting their activities there.The UN said this has disrupted the “supply change” of aid to much of northern Syria, which before the latest conflict was already home to nearly a million displaced people who depended on aid to survive.“Due to changes on the ground and insecurity some NGO partners have had to transfer international staff who were operating in the northeast out of the area, and others have had to temporarily suspend operations,” Hedinn Halldorsson from the agency in Damascus, told The Independent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A slew of countries including the UK has also imposed arms embargoes on Ankara, to little effect.\u0026nbspBut despite the mounting pressure, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan remained defiant, saying earlier: “We will never declare a ceasefire.”Back in Syria, meanwhile,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspa rebel spokesman confirmed that the “operation is ongoing in\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain.” From the Turkish side of the border, ambulances could be seen in war-ravaged town racing away from the front,\u0026nbsptowards hospitals.A briefing paper released by the Turkish government said the town centre of\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain\u0026nbsphad been “cleared out of terrorists” along with 1,217 sq km of territory.Aid workers in Syria said international staff having to evacuate the country because of regime presence,\u0026nbspwould only see the humanitarian crisis worsen.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish Red Crescent (KRC)\u0026nbspcalled the sudden withdrawal\u0026nbspa “disaster” saying the KRC’s 1,000 or so staffers and volunteers were unable to shoulder the burden alone.“Coordination has almost collapsed since the international staffers had to leave. The burden was on them to secure cross border aid. We were also dependent on our partners to get funds, we need international doctors to support us,” the KRC’s Dr Sherwan Berry said.Turkey ‘effectively holding 50 US nuclear bombs hostage’ at air baseRussian soldiers filmed apparently moving into US Syria baseNine suspected Isis members escape from camp in Syria, says FranceMilitary veterans Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg clash over SyriaHow Russia is filling the gap left by Trump’s withdrawal of US troops “We have such a load on our shoulders. We don’t have enough staff to man the hospitals, we lost a lot of clinics to shelling and bombing, we have 300,000 displaced people needing food, shelter, water and medical care. We are struggling to provide for them,” he added.He said that KRC ambulances had been targeted by Turkish strikes and several hospitals taken out of service because of the fighting.“Tens of thousands of internally displaced civilians are sleeping on the ground, lacking food, medicine and water,” he added.A senior foreign humanitarian professional, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said should the regime retain control of northeast Syria and the border\u0026nbspit would be “catastrophic” as they would not be able to return.\u0026nbsp“International aid agencies have been supporting hospitals in all the major towns and cities, they have been doing water tucking, bread distribution, rehabilitating schools, water stations and irrigations canals. They are the only actors working on de-mining,” the humanitarian worker said.Created with Sketch.Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Turkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehicles“Our local partners and the UN cannot handle this alone” the worker added.Robert Onus, MSF Emergency Manager for Syria, said it was “impossible” to work in the current insecurity and they were “extremely worried about the safety of our Syrian colleagues and their families”.“Before the fighting, you already had hundreds of thousands of displaced people who were 100 per cent reliant on aid to survive,” Onus told The Independent.\u0026nbspHe said this was now compounded by fresh large-scale displacement, increased trauma burden from war, reduction in ability to deliver aid, as well as suspension of activities.“The crisis is already upon us, it is just about what magnitude it will take,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There would be a big awareness campaign, posters in schools and a fortune spent on preventing those deaths.But that is the figure for the number of school-aged children who die from suicide each year.In  there were . That’s more than four a week. It’s absolutely horrying.This week The Health Foundation charity spoke out to demand schools focus more on teaching kids to be happy rather than just passing exams.There should be a greater focus on the arts, it insisted, because too big a focus on academic success is harming children’s mental health.Schools need to do all they can to tackle mental health problems, and giving pupils the chance to take part in art, drama and music is one way that could really help.Many headteachers are far too focused on academic ­success but actually one of their most important jobs is to build young people into the adults they will become.I know first-hand how important the arts are. My brother, Sam, died by suicide on January , . I was in my bedroom when I heard my mum’s scream.I ran in and went into autopilot, using my first aid ­training to try to resuscitate Sam. Tragically, he couldn’t be saved.He had been diagnosed with clinical depression in September  but told very few people as he felt he would be treated ­dferently and would be laughed at.Sam was hugely interested in art and music, and I know he found a lot of comfort from them. It’s about expressing your emotions in a dferent way.Too often, schools are “exam factories”, and the stress that goes with achieving academic success can be tough.If you have somewhere to paint or draw, or pick up an instrument and do something enjoyable without any pressure, it can hugely benefit a person’s wellbeing. It’s a form of therapy.I do appreciate that these subjects may be the first to be cut when school budgets are tight. After all, they are not core subjects. But it’s vital that we look at education as more than just maths, science and English GCSEs.Just this week, Andrew Lloyd Webber said cutting school arts and music budgets is “the stupidest thing that could have ever happened”.He talked about a struggling school in North London which has been transformed, simply by giving each pupil a violin and music lessons.It has gone from being in special measures to having its first pupil land a scholarship to Oxford.I’m not at all surprised by this. The real benefit, though, is allowing pupils to find a ­passion and something they enjoy, just for the sake of it.School can play a large part in a person’s mental health.It is where children spend most of their time and where they develop into adulthood.But following my brother’s death, I was shocked to learn that teachers are not given any mandatory instruction during their teacher training on how to spot and tackle mental health problems.So I started a petition, and that has now reached nearly , signatures.Thanks to The Sun, I was introduced to Boris Johnson at the paper’s Who Cares Wins health awards, then last week, on World Mental Health Day, the Prime Minister personally received my petition in ­Downing Street.The PM wants to see a change in how we approach mental health. No one is born stigmatising people on the grounds of race or gender or because they have dficulties with their mental health.If we can learn to stigmatise, then we can learn to be accepting. We can give children the tools to be able to talk about their mental health, right from a young age, and that will equip them for the rest of their lives.As well as providing a happy environment, teachers should be taught how to spot when someone is struggling and ­dferentiate from what is ­normal, such as exam nerves.Then they need to know how to approach that pupil and where to direct them to get help.Teachers have a hugely dficult job. They are underpaid and overworked.But they have a duty of care, and most teachers I have ­spoken to have been hugely supportive of this idea as one measure in the fight against mental health problems. Mental health awareness training has also been found to improve the wellbeing of staff, as well as students.This is important because looking after the health of our teachers is vital.A friend told me that when the pupils at Sam’s school were told about his death, it was like a bomb going off.Multiply that by all the number of ­people affected by suicide in the UK and you are looking at a problem of epic proportions.But just like putting our seatbelts on, there are ­measures we can adopt to reduce the damage. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The change is coming whether you like it or not.The young activist sailed across the Atlantic in a “zero carbon” yacht to attend the UN climate action summit in August .She made the two-week voyage in the state-of-the-art ft Malizia II yacht - one of the fastest ocean sailing boats on the planet.The £m boat - skippered by Boris Herrmann - was fitted with solar  and underwater turbines that produce electricity on board, with the aim of making the journey zero-carbon.The non-stop journey eco warrior Greta made is - in theory - the lowest-carbon option to cross the Atlantic.Before setting off from Plymouth, Thunberg accepted that solar yachts are not for everyone but says she was hoping to demonstrate there are alternatives to air travel.“I don’t tell people what to do. People can do what they want,” she said.Once in the US, Greta continued to meet with fellow activists and addressed world leaders on their moral imperative to tackle climate change.Greta delivered an impassioned speech to world leaders at the summit, saying they had “stolen my childhood” with their “empty words”.She told leaders they would never be forgiventhey failed to tackle rising temperatures.People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and the fairy tale of endless economic growth. How dare you  she asked.How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.The teenager said emissions should be cut to keep temperature rises to .C, beyond which scientists have warned the impacts of climate change become much more severe.And she warned that the situation could not be solved by business as usual and some technological solutions.The eyes of all future generations are on you. If you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.Greta looked furiously at US President Donald Trump as he unexpectedly arrived at the summit, before leaving again after  minutes.The climate change sceptic then took to Twitter to mock the internationally respected activist, who is nearly  years his junior.Greta, who has taken a year off school to bring about more action on climate change, will also be speaking at the COP climate conference in Chile in December.Greta says she first heard about climate change when she was eight, but couldnt understand why so little was being done about it.When she was aged  she suffered severe depression and stopped talking which led to her being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and selective mutism.Greta has persuaded her parents to become vegan like herself and to give up flying and she only travels abroad by train - unlike other climate change campaigners.According to one profile, she doesn’t make small talk, explaining that: “I only say what’s necessary.”After her school strike inspired millions, she continued to gain international attention after speaking at the UN Climate Talks in Poland in December  before speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos a month later.In August , she said of the devastating Amazon rainforest fires that they are a clear sign we need to stop destroying nature."},{"url":null,"title":"benefits freeze must end amber rudd","story":"The current four-year cap on working age benefits is up for review next year.Ms Rudd said she had already held conversations with Chancellor Philip Hammond over raising benefits in line with inflation once again.It would give low-income households on benefits such as Universal Credit, Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support or Housing Benefit a £ a year boost.The Work and Pensions Secretary said she would be making a “strong case” for the next Government to find the £.billion a year needed to lt the benefits freeze, which was launched in  by then Chancellor George Osborne.Ms Rudd first piled pressure on Mr Hammond to lt the cap in January this year but the plans were cast into doubt after he warned that extra money would be needed to fill a £billion black hole under a No Deal Brexit.But today Ms Rudd increased the heat on the next Chancellor by telling the Andrew Marr Show that she “would expect that to happen whatever situation because it needs to happen”.She added: “I’ve already had conversations with the Chancellor and I would expect to do so with any future government.

But we can see it and we will get there.”A Government source also said last night there were still “issues to overcome” with the EU too, adding: “Everyone will be working into the night but there won’t be a deal this evening”.A senior Brexiteer who voted against Theresa May’s deal three times said there was a “great deal of goodwill” towards Mr Johnson in the  meeting and a deal was “very close”.But the Brexiteer said they were still waiting to see the details of the proposed deal before deciding how to back it, telling The Sun: “The party is pretty much on board but we don’t know what it is so we’re on board until we know it’s time to climb off the board.”Last night Labour MP Stella Creasy claimed the Government had stitched up a behind-the-scenes deal with the DUP to allow the Northern Ireland Assembly to keep the power over abortion laws.A new bill extending abortion and same-sex marriage rights to Northern Ireland was five days from becoming law but Ms Creasy said there had been a last-minute change by ministers and claimed it was motivated by the Government’s efforts to persuade the DUP to back its Brexit deal.She accused the Government of “shamefully using women as bargaining chips”.Speaking at a joint press conference last night, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have declared Britain and the EU are on the brink of sealing a Brexit deal at today’s summit.The pair said they had received indications from EU negotiators that an agreement would be reached.Mr Macron said: “I hope, I think that a deal is just being finalised and we’re going to be able to work on that tomorrow.”Brussels now want MPs to pass an indicative vote in favour of the package on Saturday.One source said there was a “clear desire for an outcome in London that shows support” before the EU formally approves it.A short extension will still be needed so that technical details can be hammered out, they added.Also another tense day in Westminster and Brussels yesterdayThe “People’s Vote” mob have repeatedly told the world that Britain has changed its mind and is itching to reverse Brexit.

The Prime Minister is proposing that from  Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic share the same EU single market rules. This removes the need for checks on livestock and some goods at the Irish border. But this would require a border in the Irish Sea to monitor food and animal products entering Northern Ireland from mainland Britain. And officials on both sides of the English Channel said on Wednesday morning numerous obstacles still needed to be surmounted for a fresh agreement to be brokered. The PM updated his cabinet members about the progress of the deal before EU chief negotiator Michelle Barnier briefed ambassadors at pm. Mr Johnson laid out his proposals to the  Committee, who are likely to be crucial in determining whether the bill passes through Parliment.    Why is it so controversial  The talks hit two major stumbling blocks: customs and consent. The DUP has previously objected to a border in the Irish Sea as it fears it could lead to Northern Ireland’s annexation from the UK. There is an issue with Northern Ireland having to follow EU single market rules without any say. The PM proposed the system would face rolling consent with the Northern Irish Assembly or a review by the executive every four years.    Are there any other problems  Plenty. For a start the UK and the Irish Republic have dferent VAT rates and, after we leave the EU, will charge dferent tarfs on goods. A system will have to be put in place to tax goods exported from Britain to Eire via Northern Ireland. Mr Johnson’s plan is also a much harder Brexit than Theresa May ’s. GDP per capita would fall by up to % in  years, says the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. There is no guarantee on workers’ rights or environmental safeguards. Can he get it through the Commons  The numbers are tight. He needs the support of all  Conservative MPs, the  Tory MPs who’ve lost the Whip, all  DUP MPs and at least one Labour or independent. That takes him to the magic  needed for a majority.

An unnamed terrorist, speaking to Channel  News, said: “The IRA is an army and as an army we are committed to armed struggle for political and social change in Ireland. “Bearing in mind any installation or aspects of British occupation within the Six Counties - be it at the border or where - any infrastructure would be a legitimate target for attack and armed actions against those infrastructures and against the people who are manning them.”    Being interviewed at an IRA safe house, he went on: “It’s important to understand that this is a country under occupation by Britain and as in any colonial situation the people have the right there to respond by all means necessary to that occupation. “Regardless of the form of occupation - whatever kind of border there is, be it soft or so-called hard border - that’s irrelevant. “We are talking about an illegal occupation here that means the IRA reserved the right to attack those who are upholding that illegal occupation along the border and where and the illegal partition that goes with it, and those who are upholding that.”    The man, who was reportedly authorised to speak on behalf of the New IRA army council, said Britain, Ireland and the EU “constantly speak about the border asit’s been there two minutes and it’s only an issue with Brexit”. He added: “There’s been a border since , it’s been resisted, it is being resisted, it will be resisted regardless of any deal formed around it.” The New IRA reached notoriety over the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, , in Londonderry in April.

Leaders in Brussels appeared to be ready to sign on the dotted line after they made positive noises about the end being in sight. And Boris Johnson compared Brexit to being on Everest’s “Hillary Step”, saying we “can see the peak”. But with less than  hours to go before the PM’s crucial EU summit with Brussels, niggles between the Government and the DUP which props it up appeared to have left his deal on a kne-edge. No  said “thorny issues” included arrangements for customs in Northern Ireland and how best to secure “consent” for plans to avoid a hard border with the Republic.The DUP was thought to be being held mainly responsible for the latest impasse as it resisted giving further ground. VAT was also thought to be a sticking point as Brexit’s October  deadline looms.    The optimism from EU leaders appeared to give the ­impression they were happy with Mr Johnson’s deal and it was now up to our own politicians to agree to it. That would also deflect any attempt by the PM to blame Brusselshe leaves empty-handed.DUP leader Arlene Foster and its ­Westminster chief Nigel Dodds were in and out of Downing Street yesterday as Mr Johnson ­desperately struggled to keep them onside.It was thought he was checking what last-minute ­concessions he could offer the EU without losing their backing. But cracks began to show after reports suggested “EU sources” said the DUP had accepted the consent plans.Mrs Foster hit back: “‘EU sources’ are talking nonsense. Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which ­unionists and nationalists can support.” The sharp words were in contrast to those from EU chiefs. After meetings with leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French ­President Emmanuel Macron, European Council President Donald Tusk said today: “The basic foundations of this ­agreement are ready and ­theoretically we could accept a deal tomorrow.”    Mr Macron added: “I want to believe an agreement is being ­finalised and that we will be able to endorse it tomorrow.” Irish premier Leo Varadkar said: “We have a pathway to a possible deal but there are issues still to be fully resolved. “First is the issue of consent and democracy, ensuring any ­long-term arrangement that applies to Northern Ireland has the assent of the people of Northern Ireland. “Second is the whole issue of customs, ensuring that there is no customs border between north and south and no tarfs on trade.” Mr Johnson rallied Tory ­backbenchers in the Commons with his climbing comparison.He said: “If you’ll excuse a ­mountaineering metaphor, we are at the Hillary Step and the summit, you can see but it’s shrouded in cloud. But we can see it and we will get there.”    Sources also said Mr Johnson compared Brexit to Hollywood film The Shawshank ­Redemption in which the hero escapes jail by wading through a tunnel of sewage. The PM then had talks with the  Committee, followed by a Cabinet meeting. A source said: “He said there was a chance of securing a good deal but we are not there yet and there remain outstanding issues.” EU leaders are due to gather from pm tomorrow.Talks between UK and bloc negotiators are to resume this morning in a fresh race against time as they fight to thrash out a pact which can be agreed at the ­make-or-break summit.    The Commons will vote today on triggering a rare Saturday sitting of Parliament this weekend, from .am to pm, for the first time since the Falkland Islands invasion in . Mr Johnson then has the task of trying to get his deal agreed in the Commons. He needs  votes for a majority.That requires the support of all  Tory MPs,  DUP and all  former Tory MPs he booted out last month for helping torpedo a no-deal departure. He would still be one vote short of the finish line so would require a Labour MP to back a deal.In reality, it is unlikely all of the  expelled Tories would support a Withdrawal Agreement, but up to about a dozen Labour backbenchers could.Others may abstain, lowering the threshold for a Government victory. A vote would be incredibly close but Mr Johnson could triumph.    While details of a possible act are sketchy, critics accuse the PM of wanting to place a customs border down the Irish Sea, something Theresa May during her time in No claimed no British leader could accept.Republican terrorists tonight warned any border infrastructure in Northern Ireland could be an attacked. The chilling threat came from the Real IRA.One terrorist said: “As an army we are committed to armed struggle for political and social change in Ireland. “Any installation or aspects of British occupation within the Six Counties, be it at the border or ­where, would be a legitimate target for attack and armed actions against those infrastructures and against the people manning them.”    If the PM fails to get a deal through the Commons by pm on Saturday, he is legally bound to ask Brussels for a fresh Brexit delay. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said today: “I can confirm, as the Prime Minister has set out, that firstly the Government will comply with the law.” But the PM’s spokesman insisted: “We will be leaving on October .” A ComRes Channel  poll found % of voters still want to leave the EU, as opposed to % for Remain.Up until now  out of  polls since July  have shown Remain ahead. Brexit has cost almost £billion since the  referendum thanks to the economy being .% smaller thanthe UK voted Remain, according to the Centre for European Reform.

Claire Willis, , was on holiday in Turkey when she patted a towel to her face after getting out the shower. The mum-of-two said she felt a pop and rushed to the mirror fearing her eyeball had actually fallen out the socket. Everything was blurry and her eye was red, so she rushed to hospital where medics told her sheaposs perforated her cornea, and told her to fly straight home.  Infection set in - forcing doctors to clamp her eyelids open - and after nine days in hospital she had to have her right eye removed Claire said she looked like an extra from The Walking Dead and has to wait until the socket heals so she can get a prosthetic. Claire from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: Tim and I were getting ready in the hotel room to go meet friends, and as itaposs really hot in Turkey, I had a shower to refresh myself. I was drying myself in the bathroom when I just felt this pop in my eye, followed by extreme blurry vision and an excruciating amount of pain. I thought my eyeball had actually popped out of my socket, thataposs how painful it was.    I raced to the mirror and I couldnapost see any blood or anything - it just looked red and sore and everything was blurry. Tim rushed me to a local hospital and a doctor told me that I had perforated my cornea and that I needed to go back to the UK. I was devastated, and I just couldnapost understand how my le had come to this or where to go from here. Speaking after the op, she added: After the bandages came off, I had to cope with how I looked and the reality hit me. I looked like an extra from The Walking Dead, and I even left my cleaning job at a school because of how it looked - I didnapost want to scare the kiddies. I was having anxiety issues in public, which really isnapost like me. I had to learn alone how to cope with a half amputated eye - it was sticky on the lids and I was scared to clean it in case I knocked the cosmetic shell out.    I never hid my eye though. I didnapost wear sunglasses, Iaposve just worn my everyday glasses and I know itaposs not forever, itaposs only until the prosthetic eye is fitted. I fought my demons, and every day, I pushed myself to go out and slowly but surely, I started feeling more confident. Claire and Timothy, , have been to Turkey every year for the past  years. It was the first day of their annual break in July when tragedy struck after Claire showered in their hotel room in preparation of going to meet friends. She felt a popping sensation in her right eye, leading to a horric amount of pain and a cloudiness of her vision. Bin man Timothy rushed his blinded we to the local hospital where an examination revealed that Claire had perforated her cornea. Devastated Claire was advised tohome to the UK immediately for medical attention and within hours, she was on a flight home with a huge bandage over her poorly eye. She said: Weaposd only been in Turkey for a few hours when I hurt my eye, and we didnapost get to enjoy any of our holiday before I had my accident. My vision had turned cloudy after I felt the pop, but then everything started going dark, and by the time we got to the Turkish hospital, all I could see was blurry lights.  Iaposve suffered with dry eyes in the past and just used eye drops, but never experienced anything like this. I was heartbroken when the doctor told me to go back to the UK, but I knew it was for the best. Thomas Cook were amazing, our hotel rep came straight to the hospital and got us on the next flight home. My eye was all bandaged up so I could fly, which was mortying, but I just wanted to get to the hospital and get it all sorted so I could book a replacement holiday. Claire went straight to Royal Stoke University Hospital when she landed where doctors were shocked to see how infected her eye had become during the flight. Her right eye was fused shut with infection, forcing doctors to clamp her eyelids open to get a look at her eyeball which had turned completely yellow. Claire spent the next nine days in hospital as doctors tried to fight the infection, but it was no use, and the suggestion of amputation was made. She said: I felt so isolated in the hospital, and when they suggested amputation, I was totally against the idea. My dad ended up convincing me to have the eyeball amputated, and although I was devastated at the idea, I was in so much pain that I knew it needed to be done. There was no saving my sight, but the surgeon decided to perform a partial removal of my eyeball rather than a full one. He removed the middle of my eye - the retina and cornea - and fitted a cosmetic shell over the lens of my eye. Claireaposs surgery was a success, and she was allowed tohome just one day after her operation.

Gill Britt, now , was just a teenager when she came to lodge with the Westaposs and their family at the now notorious  Cromwell Street in Gloucester in . She moved there when she was just  as a rebellious punk rocker but has finally revealed she saw first hand the vile abuse meted out to the tragic West children. Gill admitted she was shocked by Roseaposs rough treatment of the children but never felt like she witnessed anything she could report until one day when -year-old Anne Marie West knocked on her door.    She said: “Anne Marie must have been about  and none of the children tended to be allowed in that part of the lodgers house. “I remember Anne Marie, a little tap on my bedsit door and she came in quite distressed. “Where these bruises were on Anne, she pulled down her blouse from the top where the lining of where her bra would be. “She had very pale skin as I recall, very pale. She had black bruises all below her bra line, on her chest, on her breasts.  “I did take it in my stride because I was very naive but I do remember how horric those bruises were. Oh put yourself away Anne. “It didn’t comprehend in my head just how bad this was. I remember her lting her school skirt up and these horrible black bruises were inside her thighs. “Straight away she made it quite clear that people were doing this to her. “In hindsight, at , I would never got my head round it but as I’ve grown up and had children and had le experience. “I know that I know that those injuries were inflicted in a very abusive way.” Anne Marie, who was sexually and physically abused by her vile parents from the age of eight, would eventually escape the house a few years later still unaware Fred had murdered her mum Rena and her two sisters.    She would eventually go on to bravely testy against them in court when their evil deeds were finally exposed. Gillaposs interview was released as part of the ongoing podcast Unheard: The Fred  Rose West Tapes by author and journalist Howard Sounes. In the interview she gives a fascinating insight into daily le inside Cromwell Street where she rented a room on the first floor of the house. She says she often played her records loud, insulating herself from the Wests, who occupied rooms above and below but that she could not help but hear the sinister goings on at times. She explained: “Mum and dad would shout from time to time but when I heard the names that shewould shout at the children like aposeffing bi****apos I would think woah she is a bit angry isnapost she   “My mum would never address me at my worst using any of these words so I would think OK we wonapost be going down to do washing today with Rose in that kind of mood. “So there was a lot of he shouting, a lot of effing and baposing going on and calling the children effing b***** and so on.” Askedshe saw the Wests physically abusing the children she answered: “You would hear it, it was pretty obvious, you would hear her shouting out or she would be chasing them in some way it sounded like that. “You could hear her rowing with them and you hear crying or them shouting aposowwapos or aposget off” and this kind of thing “We never heard Fredaposs raised voice, sometimes you would look at Fred when you heard Roseaposs and his eyes would go up into his head and mine would go up into my head and you would just walk away so he was quite aware that she was shouting and moaning, swearing and using obscene language.” Anne Marie West eventually escaped after marrying boyfriend Chris Davis in  but he also revealed how he witnessed the twisted goings on in the house first hand. He described a house gripped by fear which was also used as a brothel with paying punters turning up night and day to have sex with Rose.

Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade Dany Cotton also said she had written to ministers to express “dismay and concern” that buildings are still covered in Grenfell-style cladding. A London Assembly meeting heard developers are refusing to admitthey covered buildings in the lethal material. While Ms Cotton warned the lack of knowledge about which high-rise blocks were able to withstand blazes meant “stay put” advice to residents may no longer be viable.    Stay put, where residents are advised to remain in flats, was widely criticised during phase one of the Grenfell inquiry. The policy was not revoked on the night of the  fire in West London, which killed , until two hours after the blaze began. Ms Cotton was not in operational command on the night but defended the policy when she appeared before the inquiry last year. She said: “Fire spread the entire height of Grenfell Tower in less than  minutes. “Residents and firefighters were placed in impossible conditions we had never experienced before.    “That is why I am calling for the Government to reverse more than  years of neglect in relation to fire safety and to undertake urgent research on ‘buildings that fail’, which means ‘stay put’ advice is no longer viable in those buildings. “Since , there have been more than , high-rise fires in London alone and in the vast majority of these incidents ‘stay put’ advice has been effective. It’s very important for people to know that. “It is completely understandable that ‘stay put’ advice has been questioned, but we are talking about buildings that fail, rather than advice that fails and there is no clear alternative, which is why this research is needed.”    Ms Cotton was asked what needed to be done to keep building owners honest, to which she said: “I absolutely think it’s a role for government, that they should be the ones enforcing this.” She said it was the responsibility of the owners and managers of a buildings to ensure they are safe “and, more importantly, that the building is not wrapped in flammable material with a gap behind it that allows fire to spread so rapidly”. Ms Cotton was not in operational command but defended the policy when she appeared before the inquiry last year. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: “We’re glad that the London Fire Brigadehas joined our call for a national review of evacuation procedures when ‘stay put’ fails and for urgent changes to building safety legislation. “Central government’s neglect of fire safety does not just go back  years every government from Thatcher onwards has wreaked untold damage on the UK fire and rescue service. Chair of the London Assembly Fire, Resilience and Emergency Planning Committee, Andrew Dismore said: “No fire brigade could cope with the wild west of building regulations that has been allowed to develop.

Currently, seven millionaires are made in an average week across all National Lottery games. So to mark it’s birthday next month The Daily Mirror has got the lotto balls rolling and caught up with five people whose lives were transformed forever and asked them the question everybody wants to know – what did they spend their cash on     Adam,  and Amy Pryor, , of Maidstone, Kent won £million on the Euromillions in August  Amy, , said: We won the Lottery after a tough year. Our daughter Charlotte was born seven weeks early, with a cleft palate and while doctors were running tests, more issues emerged. Charlotte was diagnosed with a chromosome  abnormality, and was totally deaf in one ear and partially deaf in another. “The first eight months of her le were spent with repeated hospital visits, and as Amy’s maternity pay was due to end, the cost of getting to hospital in London, train and parking fares added to our worry. I was working six days a week and an extra  hours a month because money was so tight. I played the National Lottery online, so my first thought when I realised I’d won was ‘We won’t have to worry about paying the mortgage.’ “My next thought was that Amy didn’t have to worry about ing to work.  “The money meant we could swap our two-bed terraced house for a four-bed detached home, which is just  yards from the special school that Charlotte will attend. “Before, we had put a little tent and a few sensory lights in the cupboard under the stairs for Charlotte. “But after the win we could spend £, building a special sensory room in the spare bedroom. Charlotte loves this room, and she’s started to reach out for the lights. “She loves the tubes with bubbles and fish and we can see her making huge progress. “Better still, it’s a space which makes her so happy – she laughs and chuckles and doesn’t stop. “She’s a gorgeous little three-year-old girl who loves her cuddles and her music – George Ezra in particular. ”We don’t know exactly what the future holds for her, but we know it’s far brighter than before. “And when Charlotte’s old enough to stand up and look in the mirror in her sensory room, she’ll see a little girl who’s truly loved.”  Lesley,  and Fred Higgins, , of Dundee, Scotland, won £million on EuroMillions last July Lesley, , said: “Once the shock of our win had settled – and it took ages to stop watching the pennies – we decided to help out projects that would last, and span generations. “I was a member of an amateur dramatic group, and knew that another member, Chris Duke, was crowdfunding to raise the £, he needed to pay an illustrator for a children’s book he’d written, helping youngsters to deal with emotions. “It was about a little girl who woke with blue hair, and whose hair changed colour to match her feelings – blue for depression, red for anger, green for envy. “Chris himself had suffered post-natal depression and designed his book to help young people talk about their feelings.  “Back in our day, you’d feel blue but be expected to snap out of it. “We spent around £, helping to get the book published and holding one of the first ever copies in my hand sent tingles up my spine. “In fact, to read the inscription naming us and thanking us brought a tear to my eye. “One young woman who read the book said she wished she’d had it as a teenager, as it would have helped her cope with mood swings. “She was so impressed she planned to keep her copy until she had children herself, so she could read it to them. “We’ve also funded harps for a local harp group. But we’ve still got our old Volvo car.”  Ruth Doyle,  and husband Peter, , of Lyneham Wiltshire won £ million on Euromillions in June  Ruth, , said: “We’ve travelled to amazing places like Japan, the Males, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but our most important trip came two years after our win, when we drove a van to Romania to rescue  dogs who had been abandoned or left to die. “We were only able to go on our mission because we retired after the win. “I was an accountant, and Peter a consultant decorator trainer. “When we got to Romania and reached the charity’s shelter, Happys, we helped walk and socialise the dogs, and although their stories were heartbreaking, they were the lucky ones – there were abandoned and dead dogs wherever we drove. “We drove the dogs back to the UK through day and night, and we kept going through Red Bull and coffee. “When we arrived back, they went to new homes. We foster dogs ourselves for  Dog At A Time Rescue.Org, and our own two rescue dogs have also benefited from our win.  “We were able to spend £, on a new hip for Bailey, our rescue collie. “He’s nearly ten, and it’s given him a new lease of le. He and our other rescue, Lily, are like children to us. “We’ve rescued  dogs in total, and  of them have been helped through our Lottery win. “We were able to extend the house and create a large bedroom – with plenty of room for us and the dogs to sleep. “Once a year, I fly my siblings to our home in Spain so we can all be together. Winning has been a force for good.”  Neil Jones, , from Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, won £. million on Lotto in . Neil said: “Nothing beats the feeling when a game all comes together in one go. “You break the balls, you are knocking them all in and as all your practice pays off, your opponent isn’t getting a chance. “The Lottery win enabled me to go back to my love of playing pool, and when I was chosen for the county team – and then had a trial for England in , I was so happy. “The day of my trial, I was thinking of my dad, as I always do when I play. “He passed away a year before my trial, and I can hear him now, saying ‘How’s it going, son ’ “He was always so proud, and it would have made him so happy to know that I was that close to playing for my country. “I have a pool room with memorabilia and a table of trophies, and I play six days out of eight. “The Lottery has enabled me to have the time to practice and compete at this level, and to get better and better.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton channels princess diana","story":"NewsKate Middleton channels Princess Diana as she takes traditional wardrobe for Pakistan tripKate Middleton is taking part in a five-day Royal Tour of Pakistan with husband Prince William, following in the footsteps of Princess Diana who regularly visited the country in the final years of her leShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video kate-william-meet-pakistan-prime-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middleton-channels-princess-diana-\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man is suing Buckingham Palace claiming his ancestors were rightful heirs to the throne - because his gran had an affair with King Edward VIII. Francois Graftieaux, , who has twice requested a DNA sample from the Queen without success, says his family were cut from the Royal bloodline in the early s following the alleged illicit tryst. He claims his father, Pierre-Edouard, was born out of an affair between the-then Prince of Wales and his granny Marie-Leonie Graftieaux - a French seamstress. But Francois alleges that Pierre-Edouard never found his way to the throne after the king abdicated, due to pressure from the Royal Family and the British Government.    This meant his family lost land, titles and wealth - and now heaposs looking for his gran to be included in the history books. Under English law, the Royal Family cannot be prosecuted under criminal law nor sued through the civil courts. But Francois believes a civil action can be brought against Buckingham Palace itself, which serves as the monarchaposs administrative headquarters. The retiree, who bears a striking resemblance to Edward, his claimed late grandfather, said that he has absolutely no interest in compensation.    He is instead looking for closure and for the history books to be rewritten as necessary to reflect his familyaposs place in the sovereigntyaposs lineage - as he has no children of his own. He said: In the s, the true line of succession was unlawfully concealed to block the Graftieauxs from their place in history. Whilst my father and I would have had no direct claim to the throne on account of Edwardaposs abdication, which also precluded his descendants from becoming King, the Graftieauxs would have become nobility at the very least. As the last of my family of Graftieauxs, I will take whatever action is possible and necessary to protect our legacy and to shed light on one of the greatest Royal sex scandals in living memory.    He has requested a DNA sample from the Queen on two previous occasions without success, in  and .  This week, Francois, who now lives in Portugal, wrote to Buckingham Palace for a third time to ask for help. He now says that,this latest plea is ignored, he may be forced to take legal action to force an investigation, possibly under the broad remit of the Human Rights Act.    He said: I am not asking the Palace for money, title or power but merely to ascertain the identity of my grandfather and the circumstances surrounding my fatheraposs birth. If the Palace again refuses to cooperate, which I strongly suspect it will, then I am happy to seek legal advice and let what amounts to the largest Royal sex scandal in history play out in public through the courts. Francoisapos own research began shortly after the death of Pierre-Edouard in . The soldier had never revealed the identity of Francoisapos grandfather to him, other than that he was someone famous who had not been allowed to marry your grandmother.    After a casual remark by a former girlfriend that Francois strongly resembled the Duke of Windsor, the title Edward took on his abdication, he began searching the family archives to find the missing piece in his ancestry. Francois believes the pair met at the Luna Park in Paris and continued a clandestine relationship for two years whenever Edward could escape from his wartime duties. But when Marie-Leonie fell pregnant in  Edward ended the relationship and allegedly bought her silence. This money that helped her to become one of Franceaposs leading fashion designers almost overnight - transforming her from penniless to plush.

Several of these planes are now being stored and maintained at Newquay airport, in Cornwall - which is expecting several more arrivals in coming days. Thomas Cook collapsed last month after failing to secure an extra £m needed to keep it afloat. The firmaposs collapse also triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, which aimed at bringing more than , holidaying Britons back home. The tour operators failure saw thousands of people lose jobs - including , in the UK.     When Thomas Cook went into liquidation the firmaposs fleet of planes -  of which they leased -  was stranded and not allowed to fly, the BBC reported.  Several of these planes have been spotted in Newquay, Cornwall, where they are being put through regular maintenance checks and full engine runs. Ryan Winfield, from Apple Aviation, said some of the stranded aircraft were being retrieved by flight operations companies. At Newquay they are being put in to storage and maintained in an airworthy condition until such time the aircraft owner makes a decision on the plans for them, likely moving to new operators, he said.    Apple Aviation was currently storing four Thomas Cook planes ahead of their reassignment. Engineers have to make regular checks to ensure they remain airworthy. Aircraft engineer Sam Hughes lost his job with Thomas Cook in Manchester but has been employed by Apple Aviation in Newquay. He said he had been aposquite fortunateapos to find work but his former colleagues were aposangry and guttedapos at the travel firmaposs demise. But it could be months before the holiday jets are rebranded and repainted for new owners. In the hours after the travel firm - which has been in operation since  - ceased trading, the government came under fire for not putting a rescue package together.    And calls have been mounted for senior figures within the company togenerous bonuses as , UK workers saw their jobs wiped out. Peter Fankhauser told MPs yesterday he was deeply sorry he failed to save the company but he looked uncomfortable as the chair of the business committee suggested he should personally cough up. Mr Fankhauser has previously said half of the £.million package he got since  came is now worthless shares in the travel giant. Meanwhile some , of the travel giantaposs , UK staff were not paid their month’s wages due at the end of last month. Kicking off the grilling of the boss in parliament yesterday, Chair Rachel Reeves said: Your apologies would perhaps ring a bit more trueyou were willing to do something about it. She told the former CEO: At the moment Iaposm afraid Mr Frankhauser the number of times youaposve said apossorryapos when youaposre not willing to put something back.    Asked about his pay Mr Fankhauser said: Iaposm not going to try and defend my base pay because in relation to a normal workeraposs base salary this is a normal amount. But he insisted that he worked extremely hard and exhaustively hard for the money. Meanwhile, a website has been set up by the Civil Aviation Authority through which Thomas Cook customers could claim refunds for their trips. It was set up to enable people with Atol-protected bookings for Thomas Cook holidays due to begin after the firm collapsed on September  to obtain refunds.

On Saturday protesters will gather outside the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicologyin Hamburg demanding the facility be closed.Their anger will be met by hundreds of furious people online who have bombarded the labaposs Google page with negative reviews.As the sickening footage of bloody, dying animals went viral, German Minister for Agriculture Barbara Otte-Kinast suggested the facility could close. If these allegations prove to be true, they would have to be punished and quick consequences be put in place, she said.  A possible revocation of the animal testing licence is being checked by LavesThe shocking footage was recorded by undercover workers from animal rights organisations Soko Tierschutz and Cruelty Free International . In the footage monkeys are seen crying while they hang from metal harnesses strapped to their necks, before they are stuffed into tiny cages. The eight-minute clip also shows toxicology tests being carried out on cats, dogs and rabbits, leaving them in a highly distressed state. The animal rights charities have had success with targeting animal testing laboratories before. Back in  an undercover investigation of the conditions at a neuroscience facility in Tübingen caused people to protest in large numbers.  As a result the institute stopped its controversial monkey brain experiments. If the fury articulated on the LPTaposs Google page is channelled at the protests on Saturday, then the future of the lab could be in doubt. Vile and evil, one person wrote. I only hope all these animals can have peace in their lives after going through your living hell. Another added: How is it even possible in   I feel so bad about what I saw today, I canapost imagine what those poor living creatures have endured....in the name of progress and technology  According to CFI, tests carried out at the laboratory involve poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a ‘safe’ dose for humans might be.  They claim the animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects. The horric effects include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death. CFI claim animals are not given pain relief or anaesthetics. The undercover worker said staff are not trained animal carers and were often violent towards the animals. They said they witnessed beagles bleeding after the experiments in which pipes forced were down their throat as they were given capsules.  Michelle Thew, CFI chief executive, is calling for the laws to be changed. He said: Our investigation has uncovered appalling animal suffering, inadequate care, poor practices and breaches of European and German law. We are calling for LPT to be closed. We are also calling for a comprehensive review into the use of animals in regulatory toxicity testing in Europe, including the UK. Every investigation, without fail, shows a similar tale of misery and disregard of the law.An  online petition  has been launched by activist Carolin Iding that calls for LPT to be shut down."},{"url":null,"title":"inside horror fur farms distressed","story":"NewsInside horror of fur farms where distressed minks and foxes resort to cannibalismAnti-fur campaigners have visited  farms in Finland that supply the UK market to discover harrowing scenes of animals suffering in poor living conditionsShareCommentsByNada Farhoud:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video pete-wicks-shocked-inhumane-conditions-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news inside-horror-fur-farms-distressed-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The animals were filmed suffering painful wounds and even resorting to cannibalism because they were so distressed, campaigners claim. Mink lay dead in their tiny, filthy cages and others had ­injuries including infected eyes, cuts and weeping sores. Repetitive cage pacing and head swaying was also witnessed, classic signs of mental distress and boredom. Fur farms were banned in Britain in . But Finland exports millions of pounds of fur to here each year.    Humane Society International UK, which discovered the harrowing scenes of animal misery at  farms in the Nordic country, wants fur sales stopped. The charity’s Claire Bass said: “All of this suffering to provide a frivolous product the fashion industry does not need. The UK imports millions of pounds of fur from Finland with many unsuspecting British consumers buying from farms like the ones we visited. “It’s tragic to think that fur from the baby foxes we saw on these farms could one day end up on a UK shop shelf. “We saw a few hundred of the millions of foxes and mink in miles of battery cages. These poor young animals exist only as vessels for their fur, as broken and tormented souls. “Despite what the fur trade tries to portray on catwalks, there is nothing glamorous about fur. As long as the UK allows British businesses to trade in fur, we are complicit in the cruelty.  “Britain was the first country in the world to ban fur farming, now it’s time for us to finish the job and become the first country in the world to ban sales too.” Towie TV star Pete Wicks, who joined the charity on the investigation, added: “It was ­sickening, I don’t believe anyone who has seen the state of these poor animals, terried and trapped in tiny cages, would ever wear fur again. “It’s great the UK banned fur farming, but it doesn’t make sense that we’re still selling fur from farms like these.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton wears traditional hat","story":"NewsKate and William wear traditional Chitrali hats - just like Diana did in Kate Middleton and Prince William wore traditional outfits similar to one worn by his mum Princess Diana as they visited Pakistans Hindu Kush mountain range to learn more about climate changeShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video prince-william-kate-wear-traditional-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news kate-middleton-wears-traditional-hat-\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The small SAS convoy was heading to the Iraqi border in north-eastern Syria when they spotted two children lying by the road and thought they may be alive. The elite troops stopped to help and set up security positions in case of an ambush. Four of the group approached the children – believed to be brother and sister, aged around five and eight years – carrying medical bags. After inspecting them, they realised they were dead and found  deadly grenades beneath them.    Wires were attached to the grenades’ pins, taped to the corpses and buried in the ground. Any attempt to move the children would have tugged on the wires, removing the grenades’ pins, and cause a massive blast, killing those who came to their aid. Fearing there could also be mines or roadside bombs planted nearby, the team searched the road for explosives and then spent an hour dismantling the grenade necklace which had been laid under the kids. The soldiers dug a grave at the side of the road, buried them and paid their respects marking the spot with a series of stones. A source said : “They were heading towards Iraq when we saw the kids, you see lots of bodies but kids are dferent and we thought they might be alive and couldn’t just drive past. “They know IS used bodies to hide IEDs and carefully checked to seethey were alive, quickly spotting more than a dozen grenades hooked up to them - sadly they were both dead. “It is thought they were brother and sister. They couldn’t leave them lying there, so cleared the threat, buried them together and said a quick payer, it wasn’t much but they could in dficult circumstances.” Despite IS’s defeat in Syria there are thousands of Islamic State extremists still at large in sleeper cells bent on revenge.    The heavily- armed SAS patrol had been operating in north east Syria with other special forces units when it was ordered to withdraw to the Iraq border following the decision by the Turks to mount an offensive against the Kurds. President Trump’s sudden move to pull out , American special forces troops paved the way for the Turkish invasion which has threatened genocide against Kurds. Yesterday Russian troops, who along with Syrian regime forces, have come to the rescue of Kurdish troops in “deal with the devil” rescue pact, continued their advance towards Turkish lines. But Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defied pressure for a ceasefire in Syria and said the only way the offensive would end wasSyrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area. Russia said it was working to prevent a conflict between Turkish troops and Syrian government forces that have moved into Kurdish-held areas in the northeast. The American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the US and cleared the way for Turkey’s invasion aimed at crushing them. In an address to his ruling party legislators, Erdogan said Turkey would not be coerced into stopping its offensive. He vowed to press ahead with the incursion until Turkish troops reach a depth of - miles inside Syria along a border area where Turkey intends to form a “safe zone”.

Tragically, Mariam has been left to raise her massive family alone after her husband walked out on her almost four years ago. Now , doctors have taken action to stop Mariam having more children after it emerged her father had  children with several dferent women. Mariam has three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins and incredibly manages to care for and feed them all on her own. The fertile mum was just  when she was married to her husband, who at  was  years her senior.    Just a year later she gave birth to her first set of twins. Now, she and all of her kids have no choice to live in appallingly cramped conditions in just four tiny homes made from cement bricks and a corrugated iron roof. Mariam, from Uganda, and her brood live surrounded by coffee fields. A doctor warned the mother that birth control, like the Pill, could cause her problems because she had unusually large oies. So after her first set of twins, the babies just kept coming.    Ugandan families are often large with women having . children on average. This is one of the highest birth rates in Africa but even by these standards, Mariamaposs family is enormous. At just , Mariam had  children and desperately begged her doctor for help to stop her having any more. But once again the medical advice was that she should keep getting pregnant because her oy count was so high. Mariamaposs final pregnancy three years ago ended in tragedy when she gave birth to her sixth set of twins.    One of the babies died while she was in labour and then her husband, who would often leave for weeks on end, left her for good. His name is now cursed in her family. Mariam said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money. But it was also after this birth that the mum finally got the medical help she needed to stop her having more babies.    Dr Charles Kiggundu, a gynecologist at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, said: Her case is genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate, which is releasing multiple eggs in one cycle, which signicantly increases the chance of having multiples it is always genetic. Mariam confirmed that doctors had taken action to remove the risk of her becoming pregnant again. She said the doctor told her he had cut my uterus from inside. Nothing will come in the way of the dedicated mother doing all she can to provide for her children. She works as a hairdresser, an event decorator and collects and sells scrap metal.    Mariam brews her own local gin to sell and makes herbal medicine. And she is determined her surviving children will have the very best start to le with most of her wages going on food, medical care, clothes and school fees. Hanging proudly on the wall of her tiny home are photos of her eldest children graduating from school. Despite Mariamaposs best efforts, one of her children, Ivan Kibuka, had to quit school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her.    Even Mariamaposs early years were filled with heartbreak. Her mum walked out on her, her father and her five brothers and sisters just three days after she gave birth to Mariam. He father re-married and Mariamaposs step-mother poisoned her older siblings by mixing cut glass in with their food. They all died. A visit to a relative meant Mariam escaped with her le. She said: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant.    I was told by relatives what had happened. The scars of her ordeal meant Mariam was desperate for a family of her own to love, although she admits she only ever wanted six children. Her youngsters have to make the best of what she manages to provide as a single parent. Metal bunk beds with thin mattresses are where  of her brood sleep in one small room with walls caked with grime. Others have to share mattresses on the floor while some of the children are forced to sleep in the dirt because there is simply no space.    Everyone piles in to help with chores like cooking and clearning while the older children look after their younger siblings. Each day, Mariam uses kgs of maize floor to ensure her children have enough to eat. Although fish and meat are rare treats for the family. Mariam has to be organised to make sure each day runs smoothly on there is a rota of cooking and washing duties on a wooden board in the family home.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/barry-smith.jpg ","title":"dundee legend barry smith appointed assistant manager to jim weir at forfar","story":"Barry Smith has been appointed assistant manager at Forfar after boss Jim Weir decided to make changes to his coaching staff.The former Dundee, Aldershot, East Fe, Raith Rovers and Brechin City manager will bring a wealth of coaching and management experience to his new role and takes up the post with immediate effect.Following discussions, Gary Irvine has agreed to concentrate on his playing role at the League One club and long-serving Barry Sellars will be stepping aside from his coaching role and leaving Station Park.Sellars joined the club in a playing capacity under Ian McPhee nearly  years ago and, apart from a four-year spell back with home-town club Arbroath and one season up at Peterhead, he has served the Loons well in both a playing and coaching capacity since and has been a popular figure around the club.Weir has been hit by a further injury blow with midfielder Murray MacKintosh joining Dale Hilson and Andy Jackson on the sidelines after the ankle injury he picked up at Dumbarton in the Loons’ last outing failed to respond to treatment.MacKintosh has been ruled out for several weeks, while striker Hilson is to go for a scan on the leg injury he suffered against Falkirk a month ago and fellow-frontman Jackson is still recovering from a severe concussion.“Unfortunately, injuries appear to be a feature of this season so far,” Weir said.“Murray’s one is the latest and it will be a few weeks until I have a full squad available.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da5853128f723.96970323-424x564.jpg ","title":"dundee winger josh mcpake keen to prove himself at dens during loan spell","story":"Winger Josh McPake is determined to make his name at Dundee during his season-long loan spell at Dens Park.The Rangers youngster joined up with namesake James McPake’s side this summer to gain some much-needed first-team experience.The -year-old has impressed in spells for the Dark Blues this season with his quick feet and direct running.He’s been in and out of the team lately but he’s eager to get more of a taste of first-team football.He said: “I’m really enjoying it at Dundee and playing in the Championship.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather. The south facing aspect also responds to the immersive surrounding views, and a landscape architect is involved with the proposals for the outdoor areas.However, the plans have attracted objections from seven nearby households, who raised concerns over noise pollution and traffic congestion.Linda McCafferty, of Craig Terrace, writes in her objection: ldquoThe new build is going to restrict the view down the valley as we have at present, has this been considered ldquoIf so, where is sufficient parking going to be or will lsquowacky racesrsquo remain the status quo  It is a new build and this should be taken into account.ldquoDue to the new build coming out towards the residents of Craig Terrace this will now mean that due to its proximity we will overlook the new nursery, which also means that residents will lose their privacy due to the proximity of the new build.The proposals were heard at a meeting of the councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday October , where council planning officers urged elected members to approve the plans.Although an objector had been scheduled to appear before the committee, and give their point of view, no one showed up.Hawick councillor Clair Ramage told the chamber: ldquoI fully support this.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved.

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant.

Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules.

As someone who had previously attended protests at NATO summits, I was naturally disappointed in the result. Though I do remember the quality of contributions on the conference floor, and I donrsquot believe that the decision made is irreversible. Indeed, while the issue has been off the radar in recent years, it is now vital that it reopens.One contribution in that Perth debate did stick with me. Alyn Smith said that it would be odd for an independent Scotland not to join NATO. That sent a wider signal to the conference. It was an lsquoadults in the roomrsquo type comment. This SNP would be for assimilation into the world system, as a lsquosensiblersquo alternative to challenging the sane, and measured, status quo.Long gone were the days where the SNP would produce leaflets outlining why becoming a member of NATO would be counter-productive to achieving peace and disarmament. Odd, fringe, perhaps romantic in its approach to geopolitics and lacking in pragmatism. That, anyway, is what those who pushed the argument for the SNP to become a pro-NATO organisation, posited.Yet, increasingly, the lsquoadultsrsquo have to come to terms with the reality of a failing world system. The lsquorules-basedrsquo global order was already irrevocably broken when the US invaded Iraq. Since then it has sunk into a deeper morass. And recent events in Northern Syria, with the Turkish invasion and bombing of the Kurds, have shown the bankruptcy of NATO.It is time to re-open the debate on Scotland and NATO, and SNP members could do worse than seeking to overturn the reversal of their long-held anti-NATO policy led by Angus Robertson seven years ago.Turkey is a member of NATO. As you read this, they are attempting to bomb the Kurds into submission. The Kurds played a critical role in defeating ISIS forces in the region. Approximately -, ISIS militants are held in Kurdish-run prisons.We know Turkey would have preferred the Kurds were defeated, as their long history of oppressing the Kurdish people shows. Trumprsquos betrayal of the Kurds also came alongside a totally  narrative on the defeat of ISIS, which he takes American credit for. In truth, it would not have been possible without Kurdish resistance on the ground.There have been calls for sanctions on Turkey. And there are widespread calls for Turkey to be expelled from NATO. But this is not as simple as it may sound. NATO is not a moral arbiter of global affairs, it is a military alliance, based on competition and war. And it is undemocratic and unaccountable to the populations from which the nations which compose it come from.It is said that the present Turkish aggression is counter to the aims of NATO. In many ways this is true. But since NATO is a block of countries who are interested in the extension of American and European military power in the Middle East and North Africa, Turkey plays a vital strategic role. Which makes the situation complex for NATO.Even after Turkey started bombing Kurds in northern Syria, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stopped short of outright condemnation.Stefano Stefanini, Italyrsquos former permanent representative to NATO, said that the alliance was ldquopowerless in trying to manage Turkeyrsquos action in Syria, without US backing.Yet you will hear some people naively arguing that, should Scotland be a member of NATO, we might somehow add our weight to pull NATO in a more progressive direction. That, however, is a total misunderstanding of what NATO is.Primarily, it is an instrument of US power. It grants the US signicant rights in our own country, including the right to base its military operations here, and that includes nuclear weapons.And letrsquos look specically at Turkey in this context. Turkey is the second largest military in NATO, with the US in first place. It plays a vital strategic role for NATO in opening access to the Middle East via the #ncirlik airbase. Not only that, the base holds approximately  US nuclear bombs. These bombs have been a long-term problem for US strategists and are a hangover from the Cold War. But they remain, and illustrate the problem NATO has with containing Turkey.Because while the relationship is strained, Turkey still provides many strategic options for the West. Little wonder that official spokespeople for NATO are guarded in their criticisms of Erdogan.Indeed, NATO is under stress from Trump too. He is touring around NATO countries demanding more money is poured into the alliance. To repeat, NATO is not a collective security shield as it is often projected, but a combative, military alliance based on building the power and influence of American interests.These then, are the reasons why supporters of Scottish independence must consider the present SNP position on NATO. If we are serious about self-determination, can we really join a nuclear club who seem impotent in the face of the oppression of the Kurds If we are serious about democracy, can we sign up to a military alliance who will demand increasing pots of money Are we prepared to send Scottish men and women to fight in future conflicts over which we have no oversight, as the global state system teeters on the brink of another financial crisis and as proxy wars turn into regional and international conflicts Surely, the answer is no. If there was ever a time to make a stand for peace, and for an alternative world order that moves beyond the imperialist rivalries of competing blocks of states, which only ever leads to disaster for ordinary people, it is now."},{"url":null,"title":"kemnay post office set to reopen in 2019","story":"The Kemnay Post Office is set to reopen next month in a new location.The Post Office has announced that the new community branch will be located at the McColl’s shop on Aquithie Road.The new location is just a short walk from the previous Post Office on High Street, which has been temporarily closed since October due to the resignation of the previous Postmaster and the withdrawal of the premises for Post Office use.When the move goes ahead, the branch will open, from am–pm Monday to Saturday and am–pm on Sunday.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThousands of people across Scotland, including folk in Orkney, will get the chance to listen to birdsong in some rather unusual locations tomorrow, October , as part of a RSPB Scotland#s initiative to highlight declines in wildle.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories.

The idea that we need a compulsory voter ID system to prevent fraud is like saying we need a new law against hunting unicorns. It is a solution to a problem that does not exist.#Still worse, the so-called solution creates a new problem, by harming our democratic rights.“Not everyone has a passport or drivers’ licence and elderly voters especially will not appreciate the complication that this would add to what should be a simple act of civic engagement.”He argued that the high turnout in August#s Holyrood by-election showed that the community valued its democratic rights and there was no need for a voter ID scheme.“We should continue to encourage higher voting rates, not throw obstacles in the way. The government should think again.”Chief executive of the Electoral Reform SocietyDarren Hughes is among critics of the #electoral integrity# proposals that would require voters to show photographic ID at polling stations. Those without a passport or drivers# licence would be able to apply for a free #local electoral identity document#.But Mr Hughes said: #When millions of people lack ID, these mooted plans risk raising the drawbridge to huge numbers of marginalised voters – including many elderly and BAME [black and minority ethnic] voters.#The ERS estimates the scheme would cost £m at each national election and Mr Hughes believes there are bigger threats to democracy that should be tackled first.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous #dark ads#, dodgy donations and disinformation. Instead of taking on the real issue, they are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.#Make no mistake – these plans will leave tens of thousands of legitimate voters voiceless. Ministers should focus on combating the real threats to our democracy, rather than suppressing voters’ rights. raquoI am shocked! Yes, shocked! By Alistair Carmichael‘s lack of understanding on why this piece of legislation has been put forward. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in Europe, and in fact the world,that doesn’t require some form of identication when an election is taking place. However, in light of massive electoral fraud in the West Midlands and the South East of England, particularly in local government elections, the current administration has decided to tighten up the rules it is long overdue. Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece all require either a national ID card or a utility bill or bank statement as proof of residency which, especially in the case of Greece, have been necessary. Australia and Israel, and certain states within America have also tightened up the rules due to similar issues with fraud.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided. So once they get that information from DfI Road they should make that decision without delay.”Meanwhile MORA has written to the DfI Planning to object to the new stadium proposals.The letter, which has been seen by the Andersonstown News, states that “Further Environemtal Information” provided by Ulster GAA in July “fails to allay” concerns about development of the stadium “to an oversized capacity”.The residents’ association insists that the redevelopment would have “unacceptable impacts” on people in the area including “excessive over-shadowing and loss of daylight”, air pollution, as well as “noise, disturbance and safety issues” should proposals for three major concerts a year at the stadium be given the green light.“In addition, the applicant has been unable to demonstrate that the road network can safely handle the extra vehicular traffic that would be generated by sporting and concert events,” the letter reads.“The applicant’s proposals for safe evacuation, which now extend to the Stockmans Lane roundabout, also give rise to serious concern and demand for more rigorous scrutiny.”A spokesperson for Ulster GAA said: “Within its planning application, including its Further Environmental Information submission, Ulster GAA has comprehensively addressed all factors relating to the stadium’s operations and impact, with the Safety Technical Group having unanimously supported the project plans.“As the stadium plans are currently under consideration by the Department for Infrastructure it would be inappropriate to comment further on the live planning application.”The Safety Technical Group comprises representatives from Sport NI Belfast City Council, the PSNI, the NI Ambulance Service the NI Fire and Rescue Service Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the GAA’s ground safety management."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shirleyvalentine-digitalad-anderstown.png","title":"playboy as relevant today as it ever was","story":"One of the most iconic plays of Irish theatre has been reimagined for our times and received a standing ovation at the Lyric Theatre during its opening night.Running until November , JM Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World tells the story of Pegeen Mikewho is tired of her le, working in her father’s pub in a small village in rural Ireland, where she isbetrothed to the dull Shawn Keogh, only for stranger Christy Mahonto walk into her le with a story that sets the whole village talking.While all the women in the village have their heads turned by Christy, whose dark secret makes him all the more attractive, the playboy’s past threatens to catch up with him and it surely does.First performed in , the play is as fresh today as it was when it caused riots in Dublin on its opening night.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dup defends its position as rivals claim its been suckered in brexit talks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thats going to be the starting point going forward.\"It is a ridiculous position to have been placed into, and it shows the total ineptitude of the DUPs so-called negotiating position over the last three years.\"Mr Allister told yesterdays Radio Ulster Nolan Show that the DUP had been \"foolish\" by shting its position on a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which had resulted it in being \"shafted\" by the Government.He told the Belfastthe removal of the \"unionist veto\" would have serious implications for Northern Irelands constitutional future in the UK.\"It is becoming clearer that the DUP were sucked into agreeing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea with the promise of a unionist veto - and once they were sucked in, they are to be shafted,\" Mr Allister said. \"If the unionist veto is to go,there is to be a customs border as well as a regulatory border, and we are to be put in captivity in the EU and removed essentially from the UK economy and put in the orbit of the economy of the Republic - then it is very serious for the future of the Union,\" he continued.Mr Allister called on the DUP to \"disavow\" the regulatory border in the Irish sea, and take a \"step back\".But Sir Jeffrey branded the remarks as unhelpful at a time when unity between unionists is called for.\"This is a time when unionist parties with common ground on Brexit should be working together rather than attacking each other,\" he told the Belfast . \"The DUP has led from the front on Brexit whilst others have remained on the sidelines.\"It is deeply disappointing that some fellow unionists are peddling nonsense against the DUP based on media speculation. \"We want to see a sensible and balanced negotiated agreement as we leave the EU, but arrangements that create barriers to trade in the Irish Sea would not be supported by us,\" Sir Jeffrey added."},{"url":null,"title":"dup held series of meetings with loyalists to discuss eu exit specifics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The warning led to calls for greater engagement with the loyalist community.In a series of tweets yesterday, journalist Brian Rowan alleged that Mrs Foster, along with other senior DUP colleagues, met with Jimmy Birch, Jackie McDonald and Matt Kincaid, who have previously been named as senior UDA figures.At a separate meeting, organised through the auspices of the Action for Community Transformation project, Mr Rowan stated that alleged senior UVF members Winston Irvine and Harry Stockman were present.Read MoreDUP defends its position as rivals claim it’s been ‘suckered’ in Brexit talksThe former BBC NI security editor said it was his view that it was important that loyalists are \"involved included in legacy and other dialogues, including Brexit\".

Is it a good deal  Is it a bad deal  Is it the only deal \"The source continued: \"If Sinn Fein thinks its all right [any Brexit deal] loyalists will think its all wrong.\"Mr Rowan also tweeted that he was told that loyalists are exploring ways for their concerns to be heard outside Northern Ireland and that a \"mechanism means\" to achieve this is currently being explored. According to the Sunday Times, sources within the UVF have said it is planning to organise demonstrations and protests using proxy groupsthe government attempts a Brexit compromise by aligning Northern Ireland and the Republic in any customs arrangement.A DUP spokesperson said: \"The Party engages with a range of stakeholders about a range of matters on an ongoing basis in the interests of moving Northern Ireland forward.\"Meanwhile, the UDA in west Belfast were said to be adopting a \"wait and see\" approach until the specics of any Brexit deal are announced.In response, the Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie had said he believes that the loyalist community has not been engaged with enough on Brexit issues.Commenting on the alleged meetings between the loyalist representatives and the DUP, loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson said there was \"nothing controversial\" about the largest unionist party engaging with a \"signicant section\" of the unionist and loyalist community.\"I dont think theres anything overly signicant about that however, I do think the DUP should be listening to the voices of the grassroots in the unionist and loyalist community,\" he added. \"I do think in the past number of days we have certainly seen a change from the DUPs position last week where they were ultimately almost signing up for an economic united Ireland.

What will actually be behind that sort of transaction  If it is as seamless as that, then it is something people will deal with and take in their stride.\"Meanwhile, Ivor Ferguson, president of the Ulster Farmers Union, told the committee that livelihoods would be ruinedthere was not an \"orderly and managed\" EU exit.Mr Ferguson painted a bleak picture when asked what the consequences of a no-deal would be for his industry.\"Right from the word go, we realised that a no-deal would be catastrophic for our farming members,\" he told MPs.\"It would be catastrophic across all sectors of farming and, indeed, for the agri-food business in general. Of course, the agri-food business and farming is the biggest sector in Northern Ireland, so it would have a detrimental effect even on the Northern Ireland economy.\"He said the potential for signicant tarfs on goods moving into the Republic of Ireland was the most concerning threat, highlighting that % of milk and % of lambs produced in Northern Ireland go south.\"What would it mean for us  It would mean market failure and it would mean bankruptcy for a fair percentage of farmers,\" Mr Ferguson said of a no-deal.\"Obviously, you can understand it is a place that we just dont want to go.\"PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George Clarke warned that while the dissident threat had been severe for a decade, there could be a potential further upsurge after Brexit.He said the UKs exit from the EU could serve as a \"clarion call\" for the violent extremists. \"They have a potential to rally,\" he said. \"There is a potential for opportunities to exist for them to carry out their terrorist crimes and activities depending on whatinfrastructure, for example, would look like.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit foster dismisses as nonsense claims dup accepts proposal on stormont consent","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.— Barack ObamaOctober , Mr Trudeau later responded with his own tweet: “Thanks my friend, we’re working hard to keep our progress going.”He is in a tough re-election fight in Monday’s parliamentary elections.Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said that might have something to do with Mr Obama’s intervention.“Trudeau is in real danger,” Mr Bothwell said. “If I were a Liberalcampaigner I would quietly point with pride to Mr Obama’s endorsement. I don’t knowI’d run around toting it as a major political issue.”Mr Bothwell said you would have to go back more than  years to find an American president intervening in a Canadian federal election.He said former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who was president from  to , visited Toronto in  when Canada was having an election about conscription and spoke in favour of it. But Mr Bothwell said he did not know how explicit he was.Thanks my friend, we’re working hard to keep our progress going. https:t.co lVPZbef— Justin TrudeauOctober , Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, called Mr Obama’s endorsement rare and said it possibly has not happened before but he does not think it will move the polls.“In fact, some people may feel this is an unwarranted foreign intrusion in Canada’s election,” Mr Wiseman said.Mr Obama also endorsed Emmanuel Macron for president in France’s  election, and he warned British voters against voting to leave the European Union.Mr Trudeau formed a close relationship with Mr Obama when he was president and the two were pictured having dinner in Ottawa earlier this year.The former president has long been popular with many Canadians. Mr Trudeau’s Liberal Party posted Mr Obama’s message into a party fundraising pitch that was emailed directly to potential donorsMr Trudeau’s rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, said that he is “not very interested what former foreign leaders are saying.” He said he would let Canadians judge whether Mr Obama’s endorsement is appropriate."},{"url":null,"title":"syrian forces enter key border town blocking turkish plans","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The town was where the US military and Kurdish fighters first united to defeat the Islamic State group four years ago.The convoys of government forces drove into Kobani after dark on Wednesday night, a resident said.Dont be a tough guy. Dont be a fool!Donald TrumpSyria’s state-run media confirmed its troops entered the town.Syria’s presence in Kobani puts a limit on Turkish ambitions in its offensive. The town lies between a Turkish-controlled enclave farther west and smaller areas to the east that Turkey seized in the past week.Turkey had talked of creating a kmdeep “safe zone”, driving out Kurdish fighters from the border region.Turkish forces had shelled Kobani in recent days as part of the offensive but had not advanced ground troops on it.The IS extremists were finally driven out in early  in their first major defeat, and an alliance was cemented that would eventually bring down the group’s “caliphate” in Syria.Now the Kurdish authority has agreed to allow Damascus to deploy its military in the town and other parts of northeast Syria to protect them from Turkey’s offensive launched after US President Donald Trump pulled back American troops working with the Kurds.Coalition forces continue a deliberate withdrawal from northeast SyriaCol Myles CagginsOn Wednesday, the US-led coalition said it had vacated a cement factory south of Kobani, which had served as a coordination centre with the Kurdish-led forces. Coalition spokesman Col Myles Caggins said that after troops left the base, two US fighter jets launched pre-planned airstrikes to destroy ammunition that was left behind.The coalition also said its forces had left Raqqa, the former capital of the Islamic State that was liberated in , and Tabqa, a town to the west.“Coalition forces continue a deliberate withdrawal from northeast Syria,” Col Caggins tweeted.On Monday, US President Donald Trump imposed limited economic sanctions on Turkey. The move came five days after Mr Trump threatened sanctions in a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which he also said thatTurkey invaded Syria Mr Erdogan would be remembered as a “devil”.Mr Trump told Mr Erdogan he would not want to be responsible for “slaughtering thousands of people”, and warned, “don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool!”Mr Erdogan defied the sanctions, saying the only way its military offensive would end wasSyrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area.Mr Erdogan also said he had “no problem” accepting an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Russia to discuss Syria. But he threw into doubt a planned November  meeting with Mr Trump, citing anger over the sanctions that Washington imposed on its NATO ally."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8xMFxcXC8xNTA5MDgwNVxcXC9QU05JLUxPR08uanBnLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImNlZWI4ZmEwZWViMWJhM2U2YTg4OTU2YThhY2E0ODExZTI0ZTc0MGEifQ==/psni-logo-jpg.png","title":"man remains custody following security alert","story":"A -year-old man remains in police custody following the conclusion of a security alert in Derry overnight.A device, which the PSNI say was an elaborate hoax, was located in a lane at Beechwood Avenue with residents of the district only able tohome in the early hours of the morning.PSNI Inspector Spence said: “At around :pm yesterday evening th October , it was reported to police that a suspicious object was located in an alleyway in the area.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us. This will be a relaxed evening where we can sit back and listen to the enthralling stories from those glory days.The event will be sponsored by The Irish News and the organising committee would like to thank them for their support and backing.Tickets can be purchased in OrsquoToolersquos bar, Loughinisland GAC clubrooms, or by contacting the clubrsquos Facebook page, email loughinislandgac@gmail, or calling  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Armstrong.jpg","title":"Armstrong takes second at Lurgan  ","story":"THE first round of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross League, hosted by Apollo CC at Lurgan Park, took place on Sunday.It was certainly a testing time for the course setters. There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively. Robert Davison finished in th with John McGuigan taking th.The Dromara Ladies had a full team out and it was Diane Wilson on her comeback who was first Dromara Lady home in fth with Martina Hawkins finishing closely behind in th. Andra Hamilton was enjoying the course and claimed a battling th place.The final race of the day was the menrsquos A race which saw Barry Kellett, Neil Armstrong and Derek Graham take to the start line.Kellett showed that moving the M category certainly hasnrsquot slowed him down as he battled with his younger rival Graham Boyd, from McConvey Cycles, for the top spot.This time it was Graham who held on to take the win, but an excellent second place and top M for Barry. Neil Armstrong claimed th just ahead of Derek Graham in th. When the scores where totalled up, it left Dromara CC taking the third team prize.Many thanks go to Apollo CC for putting on a tremendous event, considering the awful weather through the week.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo.

They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

A new shop front is also proposed alongside a new deli area, sanitary and internal seating facilities.Existing petrol pumps, fuel talks and canopy will also be replaced as part of the signicant investment proposal, alongside additional parking.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners say they received one objection to the proposal from a resident who lives nearby, with  neighbours notied about the proposal.The objection relates to proposals for changes to a traffic island outside the store on the busy Dundrum Road.The planning papers say the proposal will result in the relocation of eight fuel pumps and canopy along with an existing car wash, with the current retail unit extended. Additional fuel pumps also form par of the development proposal.Planners say that the redevelopment of the Barbican filling station is compatible with surrounding land use, will not harm the amenities of nearby residents, with the filling station and retail unit not at any risk from flooding.Signicantly, planners are content that the existing road network can cope with any extra vehicular activity at the Dundrum Road site and that adequate access arrangements and parking area is in place.One of the existing accesses to the site will be lost as a result of the redevelopment.Recommending that the amended plans should be approved, planners say that the site must only be used as a petrol filling station with no part used for the display or sale of vehicles and that all existing fuel tanks must be removed in line with current pollution guidance.Councillors will be told at next weekrsquos planning meeting thatduring development works, contamination risks are encountered which have not previously been identied, works should cease and planners notied immediately.The storersquos opening hours will remain unchanged when the redevelopment work is completed.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Later this month, the council will formally open Downpatrickrsquos new poundm household recycling centre at the Flying Horse Road which officials are confident can help increase the districtrsquos recycling rate.Earlier this year, polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk revealed details of a Province-wide recycling survey which indicated that one third of householders in the area were unhappy with how the local authority had asked them to recycle.In addition, the survey claimed % of those surveyed would only recycle when it is convenient for them, with % indicating that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling including glass, a service that until April this was unavailable in the former Down Council area.Local authority officials say that the local council has already moved to make recycling simple and convenient, with ratepayers able to place glass in their blue bins to make recycling from home as easy as possible.Council officers said the Lucid Talk survey revealed that recycling is important to % of residents across the district, % higher than the national average and that % of those who have used the local authorityrsquos recycling services were satisfied.With increased emphasis on recycling, Newry, Mourne and Down Council recently confirmed innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.To date,  groups have expressed an interest in using items left by the public at the three local centres including bicycles, furniture, paint, building materials and household bric-a-brac. A pilot project is being launched this month which will run until the end of March.Groups that have expressed an interest in taking part in the pilot include the Inverbrena Community Association in Strangford, Newcastle Community Cinema, the Downpatrick-based charity Le Change, Changes Lives, Castlewellan Regeneration, St Vincent de Paul and MYMY in Newcastle, Habitat for Humanity.The local authority has agreed a formal reuse system with the pilot scheme monitored monthly to test how successful it is.Moving forward, council officials plan to work with representatives from local groups and charities to understand their particular needs and the items they are keen to secure for their respective organisations.It has also been confirmed that a rota will be established to ensure that collection dates can be arranged for the groups and charities which sign up to the scheme.Council officials plan to liaise with the ious groups to agree collection days and advertise the scheme, with contact be made with the Environment Agency to regulate the reuse initiative.Groups keen to recycle items which have been left at the local centres will also be required to submit a business case detailing how they will be collected, refurbished and reused, in addition to maintaining a record of all material removed.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke ,has welcomed the scheme to allow local groups to reuse items left at the districtrsquos household recycling centres.ldquoI very much welcome this scheme which will operate as a pilot and be reviewed monthly, he said.While these groups cannot remove electrical items from local centres I believe the decision which prevents them from being used by local groups should be reviewed.

on the scheme mdash which started last month and is due to complete in November mdash includes a new footpath at the Killough Road and a new left turn lane from Pound Lane into the Killough Road.Other aspects of the scheme include upgrading existing traffic signal equipment and the introduction of a one-way traffic systemon Lower Stream Street from the junction towards Racecourse Hill.Roads officials say the scheme should improve traffic progression and that due to the nature of the work involved, it will be necessary to operate a number of off-peak road and lane closures.Signed ersions will be provided with the Department of Infrastructure asking motorists to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with care when travelling through, or in the vicinity of the works to help ensure the safety of road users and workers.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he was pleased with the progress on the scheme and believes that extending the closure at Pound Lane

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

We are close to a deal in which Northern Ireland would have customs and regulatory borders at the Irish Sea with local firms required to fill in four times as many customs declarations and regulatory submissions as needed across the land borderAfter two years of telling us that no bilateral talks were possible under EU rules, Leo Varadkar cooks up a deal directly with Boris Johnson.We do not know the details of the deal hatched last week at a Cheshire wedding venue, but we do know that it includes a suggestion of a customs border at the Irish sea in addition the regulatory border already offered by the Johnson government.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The deal as we understand it places the DUP in an acute dilemma. It clearly crosses the red line of treating Northern Ireland dferently from Great Britain but it has the merit of avoiding a no deal which is deeply unpopular with local business.Dr Graham Gudgin, Cambridge University academic and former economic advisor to David Trimble as first ministerThe DUP has good relations with Boris Johnson and it is being consulted. How then has it come close to a deal in which Northern Ireland would have customs and regulatory borders at the Irish Sea with local firms required to fill in four times as many customs declarations and regulatory submissions as needed across the land border Little of this may actually come to pass since any deal will include a transition period lasting one to three years. A free trade agreement negotiated during this period could remove the need for tarfs and reduce regulatory dferences hence requiring few checks anywhere including the Irish Sea.Even so, the DUP are being pushed into uncomfortable territory. This has happened because of relentless pressure from local business backed by exaggerated academic studies and civil service reports. All of this predicts disaster for the Northern Ireland economy in the case of ‘no deal’ and hence exerts huge pressure on the DUP to accept some alternative.Exaggerated predictions about no deal follow the pattern since the referendum across the UK as a whole.In a meeting in  Downing street last week the chancellor accepted that Treasury warnings have been exaggerated and said that no further Treasury reports would be issued.The Northern Ireland Civil Service which had stayed largely free of such ‘project fear’ warnings, changed tack last July and published a paper of relentless negativity. The paper began by stating that ‘it simply sets out the evidence for stakeholders to use’ but ends up saying that ‘no deal would have a profound and long-lasting [negative] impact on the economy and society’. This is the report that originated the idea that , jobs were at risk from a no deal Brexit. That this has been widely reported in the media as meaning that , jobs will be lost, is not perhaps the civil service’s fault, yet little has been done to correct this misunderstanding. In fact, the report said , ‘were at risk’, an alarmist figure that would include almost all of NI’s private sector. The , were merely the most ‘at risk’.Missing from Milton Keynes: Leah Croucher the timeline, everything we know so far Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"What the civil service report actually did was to simply to estimate the number of jobs in Northern Ireland that were associated with exports to the EU. It made little attempt to assess whether the risks were serious or remote. No further detail has been forthcoming, but it is possible to calculate that % of the jobs ‘at risk’ are in the service sector and hence not directly affected by tarfs or customs checks. Most of the other jobs are in sectors facing only low tarfs and which have already gained competitiveness from the fall in the sterling exchange rate. Yet others ‘export’ goods like fuel or cars which are not produced in NI but are passing through. Mitigation measures are not mentioned so the prediction lacks reality.Exports of services are more to do with such things as recognition of qualications and licenses. The NI Civil Service commissioned a report on the impact of Brexit on the service sector from a New York consultancy. This report used some of the same methods as the discredited Treasury analysis of  to conclude there would be large costs but was too abstract to be of real relevance to NI.To give a flavour of just how unrealistically negative the civil service report was consider its conclusion on tourism into Northern Ireland. ‘With so much uncertainty about EU Exit, there is the potential for people to be cautious about visiting NI … Any real or perceived additional constraints on their ability to cross the land border would have a negative impact on businesses in the tourism industry’.  There is no mention of the whopping % increase in external visitors to Northern Ireland since before the referendum, or the fact that any Brexit-induced decline in the sterling exchange rate is like to raise this further. As we all know, there will no constraints on people crossing the borderso why throw this irrelevant point into the report except to add negativity.Perhaps more important has been the relentless opposition of business to Brexit and especially to no deal. Business prefers no changes which complicate their lives and can of course be expected to oppose Brexit but many businesses face minimal tarfs and have kept quiet. Others like the large pharmaceutical company Almac have already taken the measures they need to obtain EU trading licenses. It is thus double counting and incorrect to suggest they are at further risk.The main problems from ‘no deal’ come in food exports especially meat and dairy products. The whole of agri-food sector exports to the EU comprise only % of output of goods and services in Northern Ireland or in other words % of sales to the outside world. Even so, almost £ billion of business is at stake and , jobs could be at risk plus parts of farmer’s incomesthe whole sector were to go under. But of course, it will not. In the event of no deal food products can be redirected into the GB market to replace Irish and other EU imports priced out by the UK’s own tarfs and quotas. If the quotas set to ensure a market for NI producers, then prices should rise for most commodities. I am told that the Treasury is currently calculating the compensation needed to offset losses in farmer’s incomes. The additional worry of no tarf on imports from the Republic should, I am also told, last for only a matter of weeks.Disruption will undoubtedly occur in food production but unless such mitigation measures are included any discussion becomes meaningless.• Graham Gudgin is a Cambridge University economist and ex advisor to David Trimble as first minister©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"irish speaking poet tries ulster scots  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Latest News s News Crime Environment Farming Offbeat Opinion People Politics Traffic and Travel Weather Your Say News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Irish speaking poet tries Ulster-ScotsPoet Damien GormanGraeme CousinsEmail Published::Saturday  October Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Sign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"National\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots.

We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

This is a charity venture. Itrsquos about providing a wonderful educationfor children who may have been struggling in mainstream and providing an alternative that doesnrsquot cost anything. Wersquore trying to do something which is beneficial to the community.Dinas Powys Community Council and councillor Andrew Robertson have objected to the plans, raising fears over traffic and noise.Ms Church has said justone vehicle will be needed to take children to and from the school.She said: ldquoWe have sent out a letter to our neighbours in the hope they can come to usthey have any problems.ldquoWe had a really positive meeting. We talked about a lot of the issues regarding who has complained and itrsquos a very small group of people.ldquoAs compared to the picture painted for them by neighbours, [the council] were surprised at what we were doing and how compliant wersquore already being.ldquoWersquore hopeful of a positive outcome but we donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen.ldquoWe have had thousands of messages of support from emails and twitter messages. Mostly itrsquos people seeing itrsquos such a positive thing wersquore doing.Marcus Goldsworthy, head of planning and regeneration at Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoA planning application has been submitted for the temporary use of a former residential annex as a school.ldquoThe application remains under consideration and planning officers have met with the applicant and her agents to discuss the further information that is required to support the application, and allow it to be fully considered. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Syriarsquos state-run media confirmed its troops entered the town.Syriarsquos presence in Kobani puts a limit on Turkish ambitions in its offensive. The town lies between a Turkish-controlled enclave farther west and smaller areas to the east that Turkey seized in the past week.Turkey had talked of creating a kmdeep ldquosafe zone, driving out Kurdish fighters from the border region.Turkish forces had shelled Kobani in recent days as part of the offensive but had not advanced ground troops on it.The IS extremists were finally driven out in early  in their first major defeat, and an alliance was cemented that would eventually bring down the grouprsquos ldquocaliphate in Syria.Now the Kurdish authority has agreed to allow Damascus to deploy its military in the town and other parts of northeast Syria to protect them from Turkeyrsquos offensive launched after US President Donald Trump pulled back American troops working with the Kurds. On Wednesday, the US-led coalition said it had vacated a cement factory south of Kobani, which had served as a coordination centre with the Kurdish-led forces. Coalition spokesman Col Myles Caggins said that after troops left the base, two US fighter jets launched pre-planned airstrikes to destroy ammunition that was left behind.The coalition also said its forces had left Raqqa, the former capital of the Islamic State that was liberated in , and Tabqa, a town to the west.ldquoCoalition forces continue a deliberate withdrawal from northeast Syria, Col Caggins tweeted.On Monday, US President Donald Trump imposed limited economic sanctions on Turkey. The move came five days after Mr Trump threatened sanctions in a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which he also said thatTurkey invaded Syria Mr Erdogan would be remembered as a ldquodevil.Mr Trump told Mr Erdogan he would not want to be responsible for ldquoslaughtering thousands of people, and warned, ldquodonrsquot be a tough guy. Donrsquot be a fool!Mr Erdogan defied the sanctions, saying the only way its military offensive would end wasSyrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area.Mr Erdogan also said he had ldquono problem accepting an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Russia to discuss Syria. But he threw into doubt a planned November  meeting with Mr Trump, citing anger over the sanctions that Washington imposed on its NATO ally..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Syrian forces enter key border town, blocking Turkish plans article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.
