It\u0027s going to get a lot worse, very quickly.This morning, Trump went on an angry defensive self-congratulatory tweet-storm, boasting about how well he is handling the crisis, and attacking \u0027fake news media and their partner the Democrat Party\u0027 for \u0027doing everything within its semi-considerable power to inflame the Coronavirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant.\u0027                  President Trump argued the stock market collapse was due to Russia and Saudi Arabia arguing over the price of oil and also blamed the \u0027Fake News\u0027           President Trump also tried to downplay the wave of coronavirus infections and deaths He then quoted Surgeon General as saying, \u0027The risk is low to the average American.\u0027That last claim is probably true.For most people under 50, in good health, it appears to be a relatively low risk virus.But the risk for elderly and infirm people is extremely high, and the speed of infection of COD-19 - way faster than normal flu - and deadly severity of its impact on people in those group- far worse than normal flu - are genuinely scary.In Italy alone, it has now infected almost as many people as SARS infected worldwide in its entirety, infections are rocketing higher every day, and the mortality rate is running at nearly 5 percent.If the same thing happens in the U.S. then hundreds of thousands of Americans will die.This eventuality would make Trump\u0027s \u0027there\u0027s nothing to worry about\u0027 rebound savagely and perhaps unforgivably in his political face.       Coronavirus patients lie face-down on their hospital beds as they are treated by medical staff in protective suits in Cremona, northern Italy, today. Research has suggested that lying face-down may improve survival chances in intensive care (Ironically, Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China – which is what Trump boasts of doing in America to great effect – and yet it\u0027s suffered the worst outbreak in Europe.)It doesn\u0027t take even a stable genius to work out why Trump is maintaining this \u0027nothing to see here\u0027 stance.If coronavirus runs riot through America, and the economy, his biggest success story, continues to implode, then the President knows he could face the vengeful wrath of voters at the ballot box.Even his die-hard base may drop their unwavering support if their relatives start dying and their business go bust.So, the stakes are potentially very high for President Trump.That\u0027s why he was even reluctant to let Americans off a cruise ship in San Francisco into quarantine, despite the risk to their health aboard a vessel with 21 confirmed cases of the virus - because he said he didn\u0027t want the number of reported US infections to rise.Seriously, Mr President?These people are not just \u0027numbers\u0027 – they\u0027re American citizens who have an absolute right to be back on U.S. soil.       Welch died last week, and his long-time friend Donald Trump paid fulsome tribute to him: \u0027There was no corporate leader like \u0027Neutron Jack\u0027, he tweeted. \u0027He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together.\u0027 Trump (L) greets former General Electric CEO Jack Welch at the beginning of a policy forum in the State Dining Room at the White House February 3, 2017 in Washington, DC To be perfectly frank, I don\u0027t care right now about what coronavirus means for Trump politically.I care about coronavirus means for public health.And the President\u0027s normal swaggering, loose-tongued, fact-challenged, wise-cracking style of leadership just doesn\u0027t work on something as serious as this.On Friday, during his weird and woeful press conference, he boasted about having a \u0027supergenius\u0027 scientist uncle at MIT, and then said: \u0027I like this stuff, I really get it, people are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, \u0027How do you know so much about this?\u0027 Maybe I have a natural ability?\u0027No offence, Mr President, but everything you\u0027re been saying about COD-19 to date suggests you have absolutely no idea what the hell you\u0027re dealing with.As your friend Jack Welch said, face reality as it is, not what you want it to be.I strongly suggest you stop your absurdly premature victory tour, leave the expert talk to the experts and start taking coronavirus a lot more seriously, before it\u0027s too late - for Americans, and for your presidency. "},{"url":null,"title":"What happens Megxit Q Prince Harry Meghans life step senior royals","story":"Share this article Was this want they wanted?  Not quite. Harry and Meghan wanted to step down as senior royals but have dual role, supporting the Queen and earning their own money.But this was unworkable? Yes. They effectively could not have their cake and eat it. It was too controversial given their global profiles and would have led to accusations they were cashing in on their royal status.How did the Queen sort out the saga? The monarch held a crisis summit at Sandringham with Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge - and it was announced a few days later there would be no dual role for the Sussexes.Why did Harry and Meghan\u0027s plans cause such shock waves?  Harry and Meghan issued a bombshell statement on January 8, without warning the Queen, and after being told by the monarch to discuss matters with the Prince of Wales first.         The Queen (pictured at Westminster on Monday) held a crisis summit at Sandringham with Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge - and it was announced a few days later there would be no dual role for the SussexesWhy did they want to step down as senior royals?  The couple spoke of their struggles dealing with royal life and the intense tabloid interest in a television documentary about their Africa tour. Meghan said: \u0027It\u0027s not enough to just survive something, that\u0027s not the point of life. You have got to thrive.\u0027 Harry has since said he wanted his family to have a \u0027more peaceful life\u0027.What were the low points following their wedding? Controversies included rows over privacy and use of private jets, a falling out between Harry and William, the launch of legal action and an attack on the press which overshadowed an official royal tour.Where will they live?  Harry and Meghan and their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor will mostly be based in North America. They are renting in Canada, so may buy a property there, or perhaps relocate to the US - Meghan\u0027s mother lives in California.         Harry and Meghan will keep their Windsor home at Frogmore Cottage (pictured) start paying commercial rent, and pay back £2.4 million in taxpayers\u0027 money spent on its renovationsWhat about Frogmore Cottage? Harry and Meghan will keep their Windsor home, start paying commercial rent, and pay back £2.4 million in taxpayers\u0027 money spent on its renovations.What will they be called? Initially the palace said they would be Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. But it was pointed out the titles mirrored those of a orcee - the Princess of Wales became Diana, Princess of Wales following the end of her marriage to Charles. They will be the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - but without their HRHs.Who had a similar title? Wallis Simpson - the last American orcee to marry a senior royal, for whom Edward VIII abdicated the throne. Mrs Simpson became the Duchess of Windsor, but was never permitted to be an HRH.                The Queen and her senior officials are said to have declared they must drop the use of the word \u0027Royal\u0027 in their Sussex Royal branding (Instagram page pictured)Have they been stripped of their HRHs like Diana?  No. Harry was born a prince and remains so. They will retain their HRHs but will not use them.How will they make money?  They are predicted to make millions from public speaking, lucrative contracts, book deals - or perhaps for Meghan, a return to acting.Will they be financially independent?  Not completely. The Prince of Wales will also continue to offer private financial support to the couple. This is expected to come from his £21 million a year Duchy of Cornwall income.Will they launch their own charitable foundation?  Yes but they are not calling it a foundation. Harry and Meghan intend to \u0027develop a new way to effect change\u0027 with a non-profit organisation.         As the couple\u0027s son Archie (pictured with Harry in Canada over Christmas 2019) will be spending most of his time in North America, it it is likely he will not have a British education, but nothing has been confirmedWill they still be able to use Sussex Royal as their brand? No. The Queen and her senior officials are said to have declared they must drop the use of the word \u0027Royal\u0027.Are Harry and Meghan happy about this? They don\u0027t appear to be. Their website states they will not use \u0027Royal\u0027 but argues that the monarchy has no jurisdiction over the use of the word \u0027Royal\u0027 overseas.What will their new brand name be?  It has not been announced. They will have to change their @SussexRoyal Instagram handle. Some options are already taken - H\u0026ampM is already a major clothing retailer.Who will pay for their security?  It\u0027s unclear which is causing controversy. It is feared the cost will fall to the taxpayer, but it could be the Sussexes themselves, the Queen or the Prince of Wales may have to pay. Neither Buckingham Palace nor the Home Office will confirm details, but the bill is estimated to be as much as £20 million a year. It won\u0027t be Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it will stop providing protection after Megxit.                The Queen has told Harry the couple (pictured together last week) are much loved by the royals and would welcomed back if they wanted as working royals in the futureWhat do Harry and Meghan say? Their website claims it is agreed they \u0027require effective security to protect them\u0027 because Harry was \u0027born into the royal family\u0027 and because Meghan has her \u0027own independent profile\u0027.What about their patronages? They will keep their royal patronages as private patronages and associations. But Harry\u0027s military appointments will be put on hold for the next 12 months.What about their Commonwealth roles? Harry is quitting his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador. But he will remain president of the Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Trust, and Meghan will still be the Trust\u0027s vice-president.Where will Archie go to school? As Archie will be spending most of his time in North America, it it is likely he will not have a British education, but nothing has been confirmed.What about Meghan\u0027s citizenship? At the time of their engagement, it was announced that Meghan would be applying for British citizenship.

The move was quickly condemned by the author’s daughter Dylan Farrow, who has alleged that Allen sexually abused her as a child, allegations that Allen has denied. Allen’s son Ronan Farrow, whose book Catch and Kill – also published by Hachette – details his investigations into institutional sexual abuse in the media and Hollywood, also blasted the decision and announced he would no longer work with Hachette. Hachette staff in the US subsequently staged a walkout at its New York offices over the memoir. The publisher then pulled the book, saying that the decision was a “difficult one”.Éditions Stock is hoping to go ahead with publication on 29 April, according to French reports, with chief executive Manuel Carcassonne telling Le Point: “Woody Allen is a great artist, film-maker, writer, and his New York Jewish humour can still be read in every line of this autobiography, in self-mockery, modesty, and the art of disguising the tragic in comedy. Including at his expense.”Carcassonne told the French magazine that he was not sure he would be able to continue with publication plans – after Hachette US cancelled publication, the rights returned to Allen – but he said he would do everything he could to release the book. “We need to recover the rights which have been returned to the author. And above all, let’s be frank, it’s the author alone who will decide.”He described Hachette US’s decision to drop the book as “sad for freedom of expression, but perfectly understandable in the American context”. This echoed the words of author Stephen King, who was criticised at the weekend for tweeting that the move “makes me very uneasy. It’s not him I don’t give a damn about Mr Allen. It’s who gets muzzled next that worries me.”Pen America also criticised the cancellation, with chief executive officer Suzanne Nossel saying that “if the end result here is that this book, regardless of its merits, disappears without a trace, readers will be denied the opportunity to read it and render their own judgments”.“As a defender of free speech and the availability of a wide breadth of books and ideas, we also fervently hope that the outcome does not lead publishers to shy away from manuscripts that editors think are worthwhile but that are about, or even by, people who may be considered contemptible,” Nossel added.Carcassonne told France Inter that Allen had been “entirely exonerated” and that “my belief is that he is completely innocent of what he has been accused of… Woody Allen is not Roman Polanski. Some of the facts of which Roman Polanski is accused are proven and recognised by him. This is not at all the case with Woody Allen, who has always protested his innocence and proven it with American justice.”Asked if he worried about the reactions of some of his authors, Carcassonne said he had not warned all of them about his plans to publish the memoir. But he said that reading the book would “satisfy and reassure those who could be its detractors”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01444cc23ab95d77da0f3c4e225f7fe908bf644f/0_0_3536_2121/master/3536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b07cc7e59d0a7a8cf74cb7ff8daf72c","title":"flybe pension fund members no safety net","story":"Trustees say there is £80m hole in scheme and no protection for workers at collapsed airlineThe 1,310 members of a Flybe pension fund have been told that there is a hole of up to £80m in their scheme and no government safety net to protect them as it is based in the Isle of Man.The British Regional Airlines Group pension scheme had assets of £138m but liabilities of £217.7m when valued in December 2018 on a “buyout” basis, according to a note put out by its trustees after Flybe’s collapse.The scheme’s large deficit does not affect the majority of people working for Flybe at the time of the collapse, as it is largely a historical fund comprising the pension savings of staff who were at Manx Airlines, British Airways CitiExpress and other brands acquired by Flybe, plus some of Flybe’s own staff. It has been closed to new members since 2002.But the scale of the funding deficit will cause alarm among the 1,310 members, who now face a nervous wait to learn what will happen to their pensions as Flybe is wound up.In December 2018, Flybe acknowledged that there was a significant shortfall in the pension plan, and began to make special contributions of £250,000 a month to close the gap. But the recovery plan for the scheme required Flybe to make the contributions every month until 2030 – which will now not be forthcoming.In a note to members, the trustees of the scheme said: “The trustee and Flybe put in place a 12-year recovery plan that was intended to complete 1 December 2030. So far, in accordance with the recovery plan agreed with the trustee, Flybe has paid into the scheme 12 monthly payments of £250,000 and a separate payment of £830,000 on 28 June 2019.“However, in light of its administration, it is anticipated that Flybe will not be in a position to meet the next monthly payment of £250,000 due at the end of March 2019.”But the trustees said they were engaging with the Connect Airways consortium, which acquired Flybe in February 2019, about what funding it would now provide.It said: “The trustee and its advisers are engaging with Connect to determine whether Connect will be in a position to honour its obligations under a guarantee that the trustee negotiated with Connect in respect of Flybe’s funding commitments under the recovery plan.”The emergence of the Isle of Man base for the pension scheme – and the lack of protection for scheme members – has alarmed pension experts. Last week the former pensions minister Steve Webb, now at the pension consultants Lane, Clark \u0026amp Peacock, said: “The creation of the Pension Protection Fund was designed to stop this happening, but the Flybe case shows that there are still gaps in the safety net. The government needs to do more to alert workers whose firms would not be protected by the PPF so that other workers do not end up in the same position as Flybe staff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02790aea0ec1d18f9a491766562330757ff1207c/0_252_6040_3624/master/6040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b8f593cd3090902853b4465c4953efe","title":"supermarkets to be allowed to increase night time deliveries","story":"Government will relax rules to limit impact of panic buying caused by coronavirus outbreakRestrictions on the hours that delivery lorries can operate in built-up areas are to be relaxed in the latest step to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.Top supermarket executives held a conference call with George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, on Monday afternoon. It was the second group call with the big grocers in four days, after a weekend that saw panic buying of essential items such as toilet roll, dried pasta and tinned tomatoes.The teleconference also discussed ways in which infected shoppers could pick up goods ordered online from stores without interacting with staff and the possible relaxation of other regulations, such as limits on drivers’ working time, in order to help those in self-isolation.Eustice said: “By allowing night-time deliveries to our supermarkets and food retailers, we can free them up to move their stocks more quickly from their warehouses to their shelves.”He added: “Our retailers have well-established contingency plans in place and are taking all the necessary steps to ensure consumers have the food and supplies they need. I will continue to work closely with them over the coming days and weeks on this.”The potential expansion of click and collect services is being discussed after the grocers made clear on Friday that there was limited capacity to expand home deliveries to cater to those in isolation.In the longer term, retailers also want the government to consider relaxing competition rules, which currently limit cooperation between retailers, if a situation develops in which food supplies are affected or stores in a particular area are forced to close because of illness.The latest call came as grocery executives said weekend trade had been akin to Easter, one of the biggest weekends of the year, as retailers struggled to keep up with demand from shoppers preparing for self-isolation or disruption caused by the spread of the disease.The British Retail Consortium trade body said demand for a limited number of products was “unprecedented outside of the Christmas period”.Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were working “round the clock” to help consumers, but that communities must also help each other. “Where people are self-isolating, it is up not just to supermarkets but also friends and neighbours to support them in getting the goods they need. This is a time for everyone to come together and support one another, particularly those who are vulnerable.”Some retailers have imposed limits on the number of items shoppers can purchase in key product areas such as antibacterial cleaner, toilet paper, hand sanitiser and long-life milk.Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket, has limited purchases of in-demand items including dried pasta, tinned vegetables, children’s medication and long-life milk to five per shopper.Asda, Morrisons and Boots have limited hand sanitiser to two bottles per customer, while online grocer Ocado has limited toilet roll orders to two packs per shopper and Calpol to three bottles. Morrisons introduced a limit of six bottles of bleach per person on Monday.One senior supermarket executive said: “Trading over the weekend has been very strong. Most of the supply chain for food retailers is short and they can get factories to ramp up production. We are getting daily deliveries, but there will be a bit of time to catch up.” Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was criticised for claiming on Friday that he had been in touch with supermarkets and that he was “confident” that food supplies would not run out. Several supermarket executives told the  that there had at that point been no communication from the government about managing potential shortages during the outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d3b6ad87a83aa8195d88804deac6cd64e392c8/0_164_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f91abfee9fd6850e88ac707c986f0e8","title":"twitter jack dorsey elliott management agreement","story":"Elliott Management, activist investor founded by billionaire Paul Singer, had purchased a $1bn stake in the companyTwitter and activist hedge fund manager Elliott Management agreed to a truce on Monday that leaves its co-founder and chief executive Jack Dorsey in place but shakes up the company’s board.Elliott, a New York-based activist investor founded by billionaire investor and philanthropist Paul Singer, had taken a $1bn stake in Twitter.Under the agreement Twitter will appoint two new board members and has promised to search for a new independent director. Twitter will also buy back $2bn in shares, the company said. The buyback will be funded in part by a $1bn investment from the technology-focused investment firm Silver Lake.Elliott Management had been concerned about Dorsey’s dual role as CEO of Twitter and Square, a financial technology company he also co-founded and where he also serves as chief executive.Last year Dorsey also announced plans to move to Africa for up to six months this year following a month-long trip visiting entrepreneurs on the continent.“Sad to be leaving the continent … for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!),” Dorsey tweeted from Addis Ababa. “Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020. Grateful I was able to experience a small part.”Last week Dorsey obliquely defended his stewardship of Twitter at a Morgan Stanley conference. “I need to re-evaluate” the plan to work from Africa “in light of Covid-19 and everything else going on”, he said.Twitter has been criticized for its slow pace on innovation and especially for its decision to close Vine, a popular short-form video app that was a precursor to the wildly popular TikTok.“Some people talk about the slow pace of development at Twitter. The expectation is to see surface level changes, but the most impactful changes are happening below the surface,” Dorsey told the conference.Twitter has only one class of stock, unlike most of its peers where the founders keep control of the company by owning shares that have greater voting rights than those held by later investors.Elliott Management has a long history of pushing for change in tech, telecoms and other companies including AT\u0026ampT and eBay.

Financial risks have fundamentally changed for the worse, even over the course of a weekend. And, since aggressive risk-taking has been rewarded for years by free-and-easy central banks, a sudden rush for safety always had the potential to become ugly.Back in the post-Lehman days, one could glimpse a route out of the mess. The banking system would be bailed out by governments to save economies states’ balance sheets would take the strain. A healthcare crisis caused by the spread of a deadly virus is plainly different and investors are also having to recognise a couple of hard economic and political truths.First, monetary handouts will be of limited use in preventing the arrival of a global recession, if that’s what’s now on the cards, and will do nothing to hasten the arrival of a vaccine. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates only a week ago, an action that already feels like an exercise in singing the wrong words to the wrong tune. Worse, by pressing the emergency button at the first whiff of worry in markets, the Fed advertised policy-makers’ panic.Second, the outbreak of a price war in the oil market has demonstrated a breakdown in international cooperation. In place of the gathering of grown-ups at the G20 summit in 2008, investors now see political tensions, opportunism and, so far, no sign of policy coordination, even within the eurozone.An unpredictable Saudi leader is playing games of brinkmanship with President Putin. Moscow, meanwhile, spies an opportunity to put the debt-laden US shale industry out of business, albeit at a hefty short-term cost to its own budget and currency. And the US president is still pretending he’s an epidemiologist and is tweeting about “fake news” as the Dow Jones opens down 2,000 points.Yet the dislocations beforehand also matter – and on that score we wait for the market to spit out its losers in the weeks ahead. Any fund with an oversized bet that the Opec oil cartel would hold a firm line on production will be nursing heavy losses.Over-leveraged companies that were betting their survival on the junk bond market are waking up to radically changed circumstances. Last week’s marginal refinancing proposals will look unfeasibly optimistic in the current climate as with Flybe last week, governments won’t be able to help all corporate casualties. And the stock market looks essentially closed for fundraising until further notice.The big-picture analysis from Mohamed El-Erian, economic adviser to German insurer Allianz, sounds correct: markets are struggling to find something to cling to. “It’s going to be messy because we’ve basically lost all our anchors,” he said. “We lost the economic anchor with the coronavirus. We’ve lost the policy anchor with people losing confidence in the Fed’s ability to turn things around. And over the weekend, we lost a market anchor with Opec”.Interesting tweet from Robert Talbut, former chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management: “Disturbing to hear that already some corporates are asking for their incentivesbonuses to be rebased because of coronavirus!”If this is correct, it would be outrageous since, as Talbut says, the executive crew never asks for higher hurdles when Lady Luck smiles upon them – Persimmon being the prime exhibit.The whisper, though, has a ring of truth about it.

Every family will be affected and those who have less will feel it the most. In a globally connected world, we are only as strong as the most vulnerable. The government must take a long-term approach to this crisis and run the country like the future matters. In a crisis, uncertainty must be minimised. That is the lesson from the financial crisis in 2008 and every global crisis before it.So first, we must agree with the EU to extend the Brexit transition period. Our businesses and our communities cannot cope with more uncertainty during this outbreak. British companies who trade with the EU do not know what terms they’ll be trading on in 10 months’ time. Add to this the falling demand and disruption created by coronavirus and it is reasonable to expect many businesses will not survive. The government has boxed itself into a corner by legislating to end the transition period in December come what may. It now faces a direct choice between narrow partisan ideology and the interests of the nation.An extension will mean that British citizens living abroad will be able to access free health care for at least another year, that we are able to continue to access the Early Warning and Response System that helped us tackle the Sars virus and bird flu. Public safety is at stake. This must happen now.Secondly we need to build the defences that will safeguard our economy from the ravages of coronavirus. The Bank of England could reduce interest rates to lower the costs of lending to business but, given interest rates are already low, this is not enough. We should introduce a government-backed guarantee to ensure loans are provided to companies that fall into trouble. We should immediately establish an emergency economic council, and include those who have experience of dealing with the 2008 financial crisis, unions and business leaders to monitor the economic situation as it evolves – introducing further measures such as reducing VAT rates and allowing for payment holidays to keep firms afloat, as well as help for people at risk of losing their homes.My community in Wigan is still dealing with the legacy of the jobs, homes and livelihoods lost in the 1980s, and the scars last a long time. But the economy has changed since then with a large number of people self-employed, working part-time or on zero-hours contracts, we have far less resilience.That is why, thirdly, we need to think beyond the impact on employers and extend statutory sick pay to the self-employed and to the 2 million people who do not qualify from day one otherwise many people will simply not be able to afford to self-isolate. This is a public health disaster waiting to happen. We must establish a Covid-19 workers’ taskforce with powers to protect people in insecure employment. This means being able to ensure workers are not under pressure to turn up to work when sick, do not lose their jobs if they self-isolate, and receive the sick pay they are entitled to. It will be agency workers in areas such as social care and gig workers who are most at risk of being forced to turn up to work. It is in nobody’s interests that they do.Finally, with over-65s most at risk, we need the equivalent of a Marshall plan to protect our older people. Coronavirus has the potential to intensify the loneliness epidemic. Charities should be given access to an emergency fund to support their work, focused on those older people who do not have relatives living close by. With the cost of borrowing currently so low, the government has no excuse not to use Wednesday’s budget to direct emergency funding to social care, which will be under severe strain over the coming months. We should be encouraging people to take time off to look after ill relatives rather than increasing pressure on the health and care system. The government should offer to cover the pay of employees needing to become temporary carers.The economic impact is already being felt. On Monday morning we witnessed the FTSE 100 on course for its biggest fall since the 2008 crash. Without clear and decisive action to address the public health, social and economic uncertainty presented by the rapid spread of coronavirus, the government risks leaving us wholly unprepared to deal with the challenges that lie ahead.

Governments have assured populations that necessary precautions and preparations are being undertaken to deal with the potential pandemic. The media has, by and large, resisted the temptation to sensationalise and overdramatise the crisis. Most of the rites of early spring have been observed: at the weekend, London train stations thronged with English and Welsh rugby supporters. A dachshund called Maisie won Crufts.This approach has been understandable, as efforts and hopes are concentrated on containing the virus. But this strange state of pseudo-normality was shattered on Monday. Following a Cobra meeting – chaired for the first time by Boris Johnson – the government’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said that coronavirus in Britain will soon spread “really quite fast”. Meanwhile, global stock markets collapsed at a rate that recalled Black Monday in 1987. Increasingly, the sense is one of queasily living on the brink of a crisis that will be both lethal and transformative. Monday’s market meltdown suggested it will shine a pitiless light on some of the economic assumptions and complacencies of the post-crash decade.The immediate source of investor panic around the world was the decision by Saudi Arabia to enter into an oil price war with Russia. At a time when demand was plummeting due to coronavirus, this was dire news for oil companies. But the near-hysteria that broke out among traders in stock markets across the world also had a deeper explanation.The consequences of a pandemic threaten to stress-test the global economy in unprecedented ways, disrupting both supply and demand. There is justified fear that nation states are in no shape to cope with the kind of economic shock in prospect. Across the west, interest rates remain cut to the bone, but globally growth has been slowing for some time. Analysts have warned that buoyant stock market figures, boosted by quantitative easing, have reflected excessive and unfounded optimism on the part of investors. Speculators have been content to enjoy the spoils of booming asset prices that bore little relation to the underlying strength of the real economy. The risk now is that a long-predicted correction will occur in the catastrophic context of societies that have ground to a halt as the result of a pandemic.Italy, the European country most badly affected by the outbreak, has flatlined economically for 20 years, and its most productive region is at the eye of the storm. As the epidemic within its borders worsens, calls on Brussels to relax eurozone-wide, legally binding restrictions on government spending will become deafening. Other chickens are coming home to roost. As balancing budgets became an obsession in western democracies, policies of fiscal stimulus through public spending went into deep hibernation. The result has been the depletion and degrading of the societal safety nets that will be needed to mitigate the crisis as it deepens.On Wednesday, the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will deliver his first budget in a context of high anxiety. Monday’s traumatic day in the City served notice of the gravity of the situation the country could face. Mr Sunak needs to demonstrate that he is prepared to do what it takes to properly fund the NHS’s response, ensure cash flows to businesses and reassert the neglected role and responsibilities of the state in our national life. The coming crisis requires nothing less than a fiscal revolution in Westminster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e07d838c5e7ac2116a0ce8c4a376bbb7fdb8382/0_163_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c0a8b4ee1ca92956e6c1179349ccba3","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of abundance","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘abundance’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘abundance’.Share your photos of what abundance means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 11 March at 10am.

The work is also a celebration of libraries and a meditation on how many have been lost, including in the UK.The library was a highlight of last year’s Venice Biennale, installed in the city’s Jewish Ghetto. It then went to Dresden and from Thursday it will be open to visitors in the UK for the first time.“If you think about the violence that has been wreaked on our social fabric over the last 10 years, the closure of libraries has been violent and vile,” De Waal said.“We should not be a society that closes libraries. It is absolutely heartbreaking.”De Waal said the closure of any library was an act of fear, “a way of closing down possibilities”.Visitors to De Waal’s library are encouraged to do things normally frowned on in libraries: talk to people around them and write in the books. When someone finds a book which means a lot to them they can borrow a pencil and write their name on labels inserted in the books.The library, its walls made from liquid porcelain, includes the work of almost 1,500 writers from 58 countries in dozens of languages and is still growing with people encouraged to suggest new titles.After six months at the British Museum the books in the library will be donated to the library of the University of Mosul in Iraq, which is being rebuilt after it was burned to the ground in 2015 by Isis. A million books were lost.De Waal is an artist best known to some for his beautiful porcelain pots. To others he might be better known as a writer, particularly for his internationally bestselling memoir The Hare with Amber Eyes in which he used his inheritance of 264 Japanese netsuke from his great-uncle Iggie to trace the fortunes of his ancestors, the Ephrussis, one of the richest of Europe’s Jewish banking families.He said he was spurred by the library of his great-grandfather, which was looted by the Nazis.“I needed to make a new library. I needed to do something incredibly positive. It was a feeling of: ‘How can I do something which is generative and positive against a landscape of polarisation and rhetoric?’“It is the most personal and significant thing I’ve done. It feels like a bit of beautiful activism really.”• Library of exile is in room 2 of the British Museum from 12 March to 8 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9efe4c9465f2e4692a0ce158e95b71993e6af8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7155f01b3866269babb5f64b25a14dca","title":"portraits of uk black female professors in pictures","story":"Phenomenal Women is said to be the first photographic exhibition honouring Britain’s black female professors.

A new wave of activists hopes to change thatIn January, after she posed for a photo in Davos alongside Greta Thunberg and several other white climate campaigners, the Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate was dismayed to see that the Associated Press news agency had cropped her out of the image. It started a global conversation about how the voices of black, Asian and minority ethnic people are erased from the climate crisis movement.Climate activism has historically been perceived as a white, middle-class pursuit, but nothing could be further from the truth. Across the UK, BAME people are at the forefront of the fight against the climate crisis. Now, their efforts are being recognised by the Climate Reframe Project, an initiative spotlighting BAME voices in climate activism, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Solberga Foundation, and put together by the team behind former Irish president Mary Robinson’s Mothers of Invention podcast. Today, it features a list of the leading figures in the UK, some of whom shared their stories with me.Why have BAME activists so often been ignored? “Historically, the environmental movement comes from a white, privileged background,” says Suzanne Dhaliwal, 37, who is researching BAME representation in the climate justice movement at the University of Brighton. “But climate change mostly affects people in the global south, so it’s fair to elevate those voices.”Many of the people I speak to have at times felt excluded. Nish Doshi is a 32-year-old climate justice organiser from Edinburgh. When Doshi – who is non-binary, and uses theythem pronouns – goes to Cop26 organising meetings for civil society alongside NGO leaders, they often find they are one of the few BAME people in the room. “There will be 50 or 60 people there, and hardly any people of colour,” they say. “They don’t even think about that at all.”Criticism has also been levelled at Extinction Rebellion (XR), with BAME people pointing out that its tactic of encouraging protesters to get arrested ignores the reality that people of colour are disproportionately likely to be targeted in their interactions with police.Yet BAME people have been central to climate activism for decades. Farhana Yamin, 55, is the international climate lawyer responsible for getting the target of net zero emissions by 2050 included in the Paris accord. She came up with the goal after growing tired of the incremental advances promised by the carbon emission trading system. “I wanted to think bolder and bigger – no more mucking around with carbon budgets,” Yamin says. “These gases are toxic. We shouldn’t create trading systems for toxic pollutants.”Recent years have seen the movement work to address its ersity problem. “When Vanessa was cropped out of that photo, that brought about a lot of healthy debate,” says Tyrone Scott, 28, an activist from London. He has been working tirelessly to get younger people into the movement, going into pupil referral units to teach students about the climate emergency. “They are so engaged,” Scott says. “It gives you so much hope for the future.”The 16-year-old Londoner Jessica Ahmed says she used to think: “Climate change doesn’t affect me. It’s not an African-person problem.” But she became an activist after attending the May 2019 school climate strikes. “I’ve never fallen behind with school,” she says. “I think I’m more on track than most people who don’t go on the strikes.” She now organises for the UK Student Climate Network, mobilising her classmates. “It sucks that we have to miss school,” she says. “But we need to make our voices heard because it’s us that are going to be the most affected by climate change.”Like Ahmed, the Manchester-based pupil Lillia Adetero, aged 10, has been striking from school, attending the Fridays for Future protests since January 2019. She often gives speeches at these strikes. “I talk about how climate change is going to affect our future and how the government isn’t doing enough,” she says. Adetero was delighted by the court of appeal ruling against the third Heathrow runway. “I’m very happy that Heathrow has been cancelled,” she says. “I’d like them to stop the Manchester airport expansion, too.”Others are trying to change the system from within. Scott stood as a Green MP candidate in Hackney South in 2019, doubling the party’s share of the vote. “It was a good experience,” he says. “But I was relieved the day after the election, I’m not going to lie. I was out every day, delivering thousands of leaflets for 10 hours at a time.”Fatima Ibrahim, 27, from London, is a codirector of the Green New Deal UK, which lobbies for the British government to put the climate crisis at the heart of the economic system, rather than seeing it as a stand-alone issue. “We have an economic system that isn’t working for the climate,” she says. “We need a system-wide change.” Her activism is cutting through: the Green New Deal was included in the 2019 Labour and Green manifestos.Many BAME activists feel a connection to the cause because they have family members in the vulnerable global south. Ibrahim is of Somalian heritage her parents moved to the UK from Canada when she was nine. Climate activism has been her life’s work. “I was that crazy nine-year-old who watched Newsnight,” she says. “Coming from a refugee family made me aware of everything that was going on in the world. And it became clear to me that climate change was the biggest threat to people everywhere. If you care about injustice or refugees, all of those things will be 100 times worse if we don’t deal with the climate crisis.” She sees her Muslim faith as integral to her activism. “I have a responsibility for the people around me and a commitment to my community and other people,” she says.Other activists have turned to nonviolent direct action to force the government to pay attention. Yamin joined XR after becoming depressed by Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris accord, and the release of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2018 that warned we had only 12 years to avert climate catastrophe. “I fell into a state of real depression – actual depression – which I’d never had before,” says Yamin. “I felt that we had failed. We hadn’t saved the world at all. It felt really bleak.”Direct action felt like a necessary corrective. “Our laws were being flouted,” says Yamin. “Laws that I helped put in place were being totally ignored.” She attended a number of XR direct actions. “I tried being arrested a few times and failed,” she jokes. “I thought: ‘I have to work harder at this being-arrested thing.’” Eventually, her wish was granted: Yamin was arrested after gluing herself to the Shell headquarters as part of the April 2019 XR protests.But it’s possible to make a difference in less dramatic ways. “It was amazing,” says 38-year-old Dave Fuller, from London, of his experience cooking for the anti-fracking protesters at the Preston New Road site near Blackpool. “When people are doing frontline work, all they want at the end of the day is a hot meal. I went up worrying that people would feel like I wasn’t fulfilling my part, but everyone was thankful someone was willing to turn up with hot food on a cold day.” He now works for Repowering, an initiative bringing affordable renewable energy to local communities.The law can also be a powerful tool. When Tessa Khan, a 37-year-old lawyer from London, heard about a landmark case brought by 900 Dutch citizens against their government for failing to uphold its climate commitments, she phoned the lawyers working on it. “I thought they were amazing,” says Khan. She went on to cofound the Climate Litigation Network, which helps citizens around the world to sue their governments on climate-crisis-related issues.“The gap between what the governments are supposed to be doing to stop global warming and what they are actually doing is growing by the day,” says Khan. Her team of four lawyers is supporting activists in Ireland who are bringing a case against the government to demand more aggressive action on the climate crisis. “We need to hold governments accountable for the promises they are making,” says Khan. “In our view, it’s unlawful for them to be as deeply negligent as they are.”All the activists I speak to are passionate about amplifying the voices of BAME people. “A big part of what I do is pushing for voices from the global south to be included in the climate change discussion,” says Doshi. They run workshops on climate colonialism and speak at events for youth leadership.“We need more black, brown and working-class voices to be heard,” agrees Adetero. “They don’t really get the opportunity to have their voices heard that white people do.”These are challenging times. “I am depressed about things,” says Doshi. “I see Trump pulling out of the Paris accord, the Trans Mountain pipeline in Canada, Bolsonaro taking away indigenous lands in Brazil.” But in spite of everything, there is also hope. “I feel like we have no choice but to be optimistic,” says Ibrahim. “The climate movement is massively growing. We’re reaching new people. The narrative is changing. We have to keep fighting against all odds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d8a7639f14f9ae7ea8132bf3a22252c68bb74b9/0_59_1291_775/master/1291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be8aea68339bf45214d55efa351a4b96","title":"indian ocean system that drives extreme weather in australia likely to worsen with global heating","story":"Researchers believe the Indian Ocean Dipole is more clearly influenced by climate change than previously thoughtIndian Ocean surface temperatures that helped drive hot and dry conditions in eastern Australia last year were more clearly influenced by climate change than previously thought and are likely to worsen in future, researchers have found.Scientists studying a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole say their observations suggest Australia could experience future conditions even more extreme than those that elevated the bushfire risk during the 2019-20 fire season.The work, led by the Australian National University and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, used coral records from the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean to examine the occurrence of “extreme positive” Indian Ocean Dipole events over the past millennium.The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the difference in temperature between the western and eastern Indian Ocean. When the IOD is in positive mode, warmer waters develop off the Horn of Africa and cooler waters develop off Indonesia. This leads to hotter and drier weather in Australia.An “extreme positive” event is when these conditions are particularly severe. Last year, an extreme positive IOD played a role in bushfires in Australia and floods in Africa.The scientists used fossil and modern coral cores to examine how frequently these events occurred back to 1240. Analysing data from 500 of those years, they found an extreme positive Indian Ocean Dipole like the one Australia experienced in 2019 was rare, occurring just 10 times.Lead author Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University , said four of the extreme positives were in the past 60 years.“We’ve seen these events becoming more frequent and our climate models suggest that’s a response to human-caused climate change,” she said.The strongest event on the instrumental record occurred in 1997. But using the coral records the researchers were able to find another more extreme case in 1675.Abram said this was one of the most concerning aspects of their findings.“We expect these events to continue becoming more frequent in future,” she said.“But one of the worrying aspects of our findings was that the largest events in our observations over recent decades weren’t as extreme as these events can get.“So it’s possible to have even more extreme events than what we’ve witnessed in recent decades.”The findings, published in Nature, are the largest record developed for the Indian Ocean Dipole. Other research has also suggested that Indian Ocean Dipole events have become more frequent in recent decades.“When we have these events we have hot and dry conditions in Australia,” Abram said.“In 2019 that elevated the bushfire risk in southeastern Australia and then we obviously saw the devastating effects that had over summer.”She said the new research showed countries needed to be aware that “recent decades don’t give us the full range of the risk these events pose”. But stabilising global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions would also stabilise how often we experience these events in future.A co-author of the paper, Matthew England, said the research also found a strong coupling between variability in the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean.While IOD and El Niño events can occur independently of each other, periods of large year-to-year swings in Indian Ocean variability “also had heightened ENSO variability in the Pacific”.“Looking at the tropical oceans in this interconnected way improves our understanding of seasonal to decadal climate variations in regions that profoundly impact Australia,” England said.He said this could help Australia “to be better prepared for future climate risks caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e2e3514d4666549cb166ead3fba576411a8c95/440_631_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be6d7d97af5a9de366acac6c5bccfb7f","title":"max von sydow an aristocrat of cinema who made me weep","story":"From his fateful game of chess to a moving turn in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Von Sydow was the last standard bearer of Bergman’s high-minded movie idiom•Max von Sydow dies aged 90•A life in picturesThe opening of the seventh seal in the Book of Revelation, disclosing the truth of God’s existence and the second coming, will result in a mysterious silence in the kingdom of heaven – then the sound of trumpets and the thunderous uproar of Earth’s apocalyptic ending. In the movies, no actor has ever represented these ideas more seriously, nor shown humanity’s anguish in the face of God’s implacable silence or unassuageable anger more clearly, than Max von Sydow. He was virtually a book of revelation in himself.The passionate severity of Von Sydow – and his ability to impersonate the ascetic nobility of some impossibly remote priestly or knightly order but with very human flaws – formed the bedrock of Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal and the staggering series of films he was to make with Bergman in the 1950s and 1960s. Beyond that, he virtually epitomised an entire, distinctively high-minded attitude to cinematic art in Europe. His films for Bergman were composed in a movie idiom that drew on Ibsen and Strindberg, Sjöström and Dreyer – and of which, since Bergman’s death in 2007, Von Sydow could be said to be the final standard bearer.This was the handsome, sensitive face unforgettably haunted by fear, love, the heroic burden of faith and the terrible inevitability of death’s looming checkmate in The Seventh Seal. He was the crusader knight who returns from his futile theocratic military adventure to find his country ravaged with plague and consumed with panic about the imminent end of everything. Surveying this catastrophe of hubris and cruelty, he is haunted by the angel of death, with whom he plays a fateful game of chess he must come to terms with what this implies about humanity’s creator and the final terrible judgment.Von Sydow exemplified a fierce seriousness and high principle that lived on in the equally outstanding work he was to do with directors such as William Friedkin, George Stevens, Woody Allen, Bille August and Julian Schnabel. It was not typecasting, exactly, but more a question of directors recognising his vocation as an actor. In Bergman’s The Virgin Spring (1960), he was the father seeking a ruthless revenge for the rape and murder of his daughter: he was virtually an avenging God himself. In Through a Glass Darkly (1961) he is a man crucified by his wife’s mental illness, and in Winter Light (1963) he is the parishioner agonised by a crisis of faith. Perhaps it is in this movie that Von Sydow conveys a gaunt protestantism of personal pain.Von Sydow made a creditable job of playing Jesus in Stevens’ The Greatest Story Ever Told in 1965, but this well-meaning and stately film (much teased for John Wayne’s drawlingly awe-struck centurion at the crucifixion scene) was too carefully respectful to tap into Von Sydow’s dark power. But what can’t be underestimated in Von Sydow’s career is his magnificent – and important – work in horror classic The Exorcist in 1973. And in the role of the exorcist himself, his face prematurely harrowed and lined with the terrible burden of knowing the ways of the evil one, no other casting was possible. The Exorcist was a popular horror masterpiece – but without the unbending, unironic seriousness that Von Sydow brought to it, the film would have had far less impact.In the 1980s, Von Sydow had a notable black-comic role – a role in which he came as close as he was ever going to come to satirising his own legendary persona – in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). He plays the difficult, misanthropic artist Frederick, whose girlfriend, Lee, played by Barbara Hershey, is being pursued by her sister Hannah’s husband. “You missed a very boring programme about Auschwitz,” Frederick rumbles at her from in front of the television, when Lee comes in from an evening of forbidden adventure. It is a thoroughly outrageous line, but Von Sydow carries it off with deadpan hauteur that is not quite the same as a gift for comedy (which this actor did not exactly have).It was a year later that Von Sydow starred in the well-regarded, Cannes Palme d’Or-winning Pelle the Conqueror. Playing an older man from Sweden who seeks a new immigrant life in Denmark, he received one of his two Oscar nominations. And it was probably this role that brought Von Sydow into a career phase that he had arguably always been preparing for: the old man. Perhaps the planes and lines of his face were always waiting for age to bring them to their fullest meaning.At any rate, his Oscar nomination for Pelle the Conqueror made more sense that his second nomination for Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, the rather lame 911 fantasy in which Von Sydow was wasted in the silly wise role of an ageing mute.For my money, the greatest of Von Sydow’s later roles, and one of his greatest ever screen performances, was in Schnabel’s The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007). He plays Papinou, a grumpy invalid who irascibly submits to the indignity of being shaved by his middle-aged son – the fashionable magazine editor and man-about-town played by Mathieu Amalric. But then his son suffers a catastrophic stroke and is paralysed by “locked-in syndrome”.The scene in which Von Sydow sobs with grief for his stricken son is a scene that Van Gogh could have pictured. I think it is the only time that I have twitched my glasses off and sobbed, really sobbed, in the cinema. And now I have to admit to being emotional at today’s news about Max von Sydow’s death. An aristocrat of cinema has gone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a40c149c62943f083d17b3f3587c82755e02358f/0_94_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47ea937ef45dded3f4b61ea38d41f4b7","title":"woody allen publisher wrong drop memoir let him speak","story":"After protests from the Farrow family and a staff walkout, Hachette has reversed its decision to publish the director’s book. But if people are so convinced of his guilt, they should let him speakWas Hachette right to cancel Woody Allen’s memoir?Patrick, LondonWhat a strange, through-the-looking-glass world we live in, when people who consider themselves to be liberals celebrate suppressing others’ words. A little background on the latest chapter in the saga that is Woody Allen and the Farrow family. It’s a lot less fun than Hannah and Her Sisters, although it does feature many of the same cast and crew members.It is completely understandable that the Farrow family would be upset about Allen’s memoir. This case has caused deep familial trauma and been horrific for those involved. It is less acceptable for outsiders to jump in with kneejerk outrage, expressing misinformed opinions. When the news broke about Allen’s memoir, several dozen Hachette employees walked out in protest. One staff member said: “We feel strongly about everyone’s right to tell their own story, but we don’t agree with giving Woody Allen a platform with which to tell it that includes distribution, marketing, publicity.” So everyone is allowed to speak, but only under certain conditions. Hachette ran scared and dropped the book.It would have been one thing if Hachette had never agreed to publish Allen’s memoir in the first place. Fair enough that’s a publisher’s prerogative. But for it to sign him, edit him and then fearfully drop him because some people object is a terrible precedent for a publisher to set. As for the Hachette employees who walked out, it is quite something for people who work in publishing to be against the publication of books. After all, if they really are so convinced of Allen’s guilt, they ought to let him speak. When I wrote about the bewildering support in the movie industry for Roman Polanski, despite being a convicted sex offender, I quoted extensively from his memoir, Roman by Polanski. Those passages, in which he described his attack on 13-year-old Samantha Geimer, were probably the most incriminating details in the piece.Similarly, when I interviewed the family of Ron Goldman, I referred to OJ Simpson’s book, If I Did It, in which the disgraced former footballer describes murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman. Unlike the Farrow family, the Goldmans decided to publish If I Did It when they were given the manuscript as part of Simpson’s assets. They were sufficiently confident about Simpson’s guilt to know that anything he said would only damage his reputation further, and they were absolutely right.But it is absurd to talk about Allen in the same breath as Polanski, let alone Simpson. Too many people now airily refer to Allen as if he were a serial sex offender, but he was not only never convicted, he was – despite being investigated – never even charged. Moreover, unlike Polanski – and Bill Cosby, and Harvey Weinstein, and R Kelly, and Michael Jackson – there has never been more than one accusation. One is one too many, but this one allegation was investigated twice and no charges brought. To talk about Allen as though he is a predatory monster who must be shunned from society goes against even the smallest idea of due process.You can argue that Allen is a beneficiary of a system that favours the rich and powerful. But you should still want him to publish his memoir because suppressing words, ideas and even people never works in the long run. Let the guilty damn themselves, if guilty they be, and trust the public to see the truth for themselves. Arguing for silence will only work to your disadvantage, because one day the one who will be silenced is you.Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, , Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

A few hours after Leeds had beaten Huddersfield 2-0 on Saturday, the club’s social media people put out a video of a recent training session at Thorp Arch, in which Ayling scores a near-perfect replica of that volleyed goal. Perhaps this is the curse of the obsessive: once you’ve seen all the tapes, logged every data point, mapped out every possible occurrence, reality itself must seem like a replay of something that everyone else is watching for the first time.Perhaps this is what it will feel like the first time Bielsa takes his place in the dugout as a Premier League manager. Yes, Bielsa in the Premier League: as outlandish at those words look on the page, it’s a probability hardening into reality with every passing week. Gather your loved ones.Avoid all non-essential travel. Stock up on toilet roll, hand sanitiser and non-perishable food items. One way or another, it’s going to be emotional.Assuming Leeds do make it – and with a seven-point cushion at the time of writing, it’s a pretty safe bet – then it’s hard to imagine many other teams who will join the top flight on such a groundswell of goodwill. It’s hard to imagine another manager held in such unanimously high regard by his rivals, who seem genuinely honoured to have shared a technical area with him. “If you’re going to get out-managed, get out-managed by a genius,” gushed Huddersfield’s manager Danny Cowley after their defeat at the weekend. “I’ll be really interested, when Leeds go up, to see how the Premier League copes with it.”This wasn’t the way it was supposed to turn out. Certainly not when Bielsa turned up at Leeds in 2018: the team who had got through 12 managers in five years, hiring a coach who had never spent a third season at the same club. Cowley had things the right way round: it’s not so much a case of how Bielsa handles the Premier League as how the Premier League handles Bielsa.What, exactly, is going to happen when a principled, leftist, no-nonsense ideologue collides with the least principled, most materialistic league on earth? What happens, in short, when you fling this most human of managers into the nonsense machine? Naturally, there’s an element of false opposition to the question. After all, the Premier League is a multiplex, and there are few more box-office managers in the world than Bielsa: a method actor in football’s theatre of the absurd. Whether it’s the frequent sightings of him in the Wetherby branch of Costa, hour-long press conferences where he pours out his tortured soul in front of a sponsored backdrop, or his latest wacky addition to the training ground – A bobsleigh track! A hydroponic farm! Actual ghosts! – you sense Bielsa will go down very well indeed in a league ever-hungry for new narratives and new characters, new themes and new memes.Above all, he possesses that rarest of gifts in this saturated, permanently-logged-in game: genuine mystique. Pep Guardiola still had a little of it before he moved to England. Back in the 1990s, Arsène Wenger and Ruud Gullit certainly did. But in today’s climate of oversharing and overexposure, it’s harder to come by. Bielsa has preserved his by speaking not in Twitter-friendly soundbites or massaged platitudes, but the opposite: the sort of humble, brutal honesty that English football, with its encrusted layers of banter, bluster and bullshit, struggles to process.Equally, part of you almost fears what the Premier League might do to Bielsa, fears how it might end, fears how easily this essentially complex man might be reduced to a quick punchline. We already got a whiff of this during last season’s spying “scandal”, but the Premier League will doubtless elevate it to a new level. The moronic press conference questions. Fans abusing him at train stations. Ex-pros on Talksport debating whether he needs to win a trophy to be taken seriously and grumbling about him not speaking English. Then, of course, there’s the football: thrilling and iconoclastic at its best, but vulnerable to a few billionaire-funded thrashings at its worst.In any case, perhaps it might never happen. Perhaps Leeds will collapse and fall short again. Perhaps Bielsa will fall out with the board over transfers and quit four days before the start of the season. Perhaps he’ll simply get bored of trying to scrape a 13th-place finish in a wildly unfair league and hanker for a fresh start. Or perhaps, having finally taken Leeds back to the promised land, he’ll take on the Premier League like a man running into fire. But gosh, you want to find out either way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21c812aaff41123c399e46e6dd58cf2e605141df/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8645ae3bd9f59d7ec98b519b2031d2b","title":"tottenhams tough task made harder by steven bergwijn injury","story":"José Mourinho laughed. What else could he do? The alternative was to burst into tears, lift the white flag and write off Tottenham’s chances of reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League when they face RB Leipzig on Tuesday evening.After all they are 1-0 down from the first leg and, well, how exactly do they turn the tie around when their attacking options are so limited? Mourinho was already without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, neither of whom are expected to feature for a while, and he wore a resigned smile as he delivered the news about Steven Bergwijn.The Dutch winger suffered an ankle injury when Spurs drew 1-1 with Burnley last Saturday and he has not made the trip to Germany. In fact, Mourinho does not expect to Bergwijn to play again this season. The blows keep coming and Spurs, who are also without Moussa Sissoko and Ben Davies, will be up against it when they resume hostilities with a side who outplayed them at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last month.Yet Spurs are not here to give up. “This isn’t the time for us to get our violins out,” said Dele Alli, who could be pressed into action up front again. Mourinho heard that and also looked to play a positive tune. The Spurs manager spoke about his side’s work ethic, professionalism and talent before insisting that they deserve “something special”. He considered the Spurs motto – “To Dare Is To Do” – and used it to issue a rallying cry.“I read it every day because it’s written everywhere,” Mourinho said. “You know more or less my principles, my philosophy, what I love and hate. I feel connection with ‘To Dare Is To Do’. Tomorrow is a time to give everything. We win or we leave everything we have on that pitch.”Spurs are not expected to go through. Leipzig, who are third in the Bundesliga, dominated the first leg and could have won by more than one goal. Julian Nagelsmann’s side are quick and energetic, they exert a high press and their star forward, Timo Werner, is coveted by Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Liverpool. It was Werner who decided the first game between these sides, scoring the only goal from the spot, and the Germany international is bound to fancy his chances against a creaky Spurs defence.The one piece of good news for Spurs is that Werner is a doubt with a thigh injury. Yet Nagelsmann still has more options in attack than Mourinho, who does not think Troy Parrott, the 18-year-old Irish forward, is ready to feature regularly. “We don’t have what I love to call the box sharks, the players who smell blood in the box and put the ball in the net,” Mourinho said. “So even when we’re dominant it is difficult to score lots of goals. Defensively we feel the pressure and every time we make a mistake it looks like we’re punished.”It was put to Mourinho that Spurs recovered from this position when they reached last season’s final at the expense of Ajax. He responded by pointing out that there is no Fernando Llorente to bring off the bench this time no target man to play off in the dying stages.“If we want the long balls in the box we can’t do it that way,” Mourinho said. “We have to try another way. If we are waiting for the last 15 to 20 minutes to put the ball in the box and try for second balls that’s not the way to do it. We don’t hide. Our attacking players are the ones we know. We don’t have others.”Spurs will need to take risks. With Davies unavailable Mourinho suggested that Ryan Sessegnon, who loves getting forward, could be a better option at left-back than the more defensive Japhet Tanganga. He talked up Lucas Moura, the hat-trick hero against Ajax, and there was backing for Alli, who struggled as a false nine during the first leg. Alli reacted badly after being substituted that night, throwing his boots to the floor before chucking a water bottle away, and he is desperate to make amends.“I was obviously disappointed to come off for many reasons,” he said. “If you ask any manager, since I started playing football, I’ve never liked being subbed – as much as I respect the manager’s decision. I understand that. I didn’t help the team as much as I would have liked. To come off at 1-0 down, sometimes the passion and frustration can get the better of you. I probably should have reacted a bit better but I care a lot.”Alli, who scored a penalty against Burnley, admitted that Spurs have not been good enough this season. Their form has remained patchy since Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino in November, they went out of the FA Cup after losing on penalties to Norwich last week and their hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League are fading after picking up one point from their last three league games.“This is where we have to show our character and belief in each other,” Alli said. “Everyone’s hungry.” That is what Mourinho wants to hear. He is a serial winner, a hoarder of major trophies, and he does not want to leave Spurs without winning one. “I won it at every club and I believe I am going to do it with Tottenham,” he said. Leipzig will test that belief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513b0506f600393808dee3048adf65dcf048242d/0_328_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b839b6c3a4a976fe2085de7318122a3","title":"rev richard coles on losing his partner davidmy life is not over but it feels like it is sometimes","story":"The former pop star’s world was shattered when his partner of 12 years died. Three months on, he talks about the ‘madness’ of griefDeath is par for the course for the Rev Richard Coles. Whether it’s pastoral care for the bereaved, discussions about the afterlife with parishioners or being called out to perform the last rites – death comes with the job. But since his partner, the Rev David Coles, died in December, a lot about death has taken Coles by surprise.“I got in the other night,” he says, “and fed the dogs and lit a fire and cooked some supper. I got into my pyjamas and had a nightcap. I then looked at my watch and it was 10 past six.”Coles is still adjusting to the quietness of a household that has recently halved in size. David’s death at 42 was unexpected, the result of an underlying health condition that had caused internal bleeding. When he was rushed to A\u0026ampE in an ambulance for surgery, Coles assumed it was just another day he had a carol service that evening to prepare for. But David never recovered from the operation.Coles is sitting on a worn beige sofa in the living room of his village vicarage in Finedon, Northamptonshire, his dog collar poking out from behind a grey jumper. One dachshund (Pongo, nine) is draped over his lap, snoring, the other (Daisy, 11) is nestled against his side. Coles did have three more dachshunds – Audrey, Horatio and General Custer – but after David died, he found five were too many to look after. He reluctantly rehomed them with David’s mother and brother, and his dentist. “They went to good homes, but it was so hard,” he says. “Seeing them go, with their little dog faces, was just horrible.”Although it’s a title he has often spurned, Coles is Britain’s de facto celebrity vicar, a result of his pop-stardom with the Communards in the mid-80s – which included the No 1 dance smash Don’t Leave Me This Way, and his position as one of the most high-profile gay clergymen in the world. His warmth and ability to distil the most complicated ideas have drawn fans from the unlikeliest of places (he was once described as the “atheist’s favourite vicar”).Millions of listeners tune in to hear his measured, soothing tones on BBC Radio 4’s hugely popular morning show Saturday Live. His television work has ranged from competing on MasterChef and Strictly Come Dancing to hosting Songs of Praise and Have I Got News For You. He is also a prolific presence on Twitter – so much so that he has given it up for Lent. Being a gay former pop star, who swears and admits to having taken drugs, has made him a modernising force in the Church of England just by virtue of being there. And to many, he represents the best of what the church can be.Yet now, a man who so often helps others to examine life’s moral questions has found himself in need of help. He is now looking to others for guidance to help him through grief. The flock is leading the shepherd. One widow gave Coles her late husband’s accordion, an instrument he’s always been keen to learn (he can so far play three songs, including the Godfather theme).“After David died, there was a woman at the hospital who had been widowed, too. She said, ‘You’re going to be mad, for a while. People will never be as nice to you again as they are now, so milk it for all you can.’” Coles can attest to the madness. The day after David’s death, he went to the supermarket and came back with three different types of parmesan.A lot about grief has surprised him: the volume of “sadmin” you have to do when someone dies, how much harder it is travelling for work alone (“I always used to call David when I stayed in a hotel on my own”), the sting of typing out a text message to his partner, then realising he is no longer there.The hardest part has been looking ahead. “I’ve had to subtract David from the future and that has taken all the future with it,” says Coles. “It’s a bit blank. I think: ‘What the fuck am I going to do? Play the accordion and go to bed at 10 past six, I guess. Of course, it’s not the end of my life. But it feels like it’s over sometimes.”Coles, 57, was born in Kettering, not far from his present parish. He was always, as he writes in his 2014 memoir, Fathomless Riches, “screamingly gay”. Not being able to pass as straight never bothered him. “If you come from somewhere like Kettering, you feel a moral responsibility to fly the flag of flamboyance,” he says.Coles came out to his mother when he was 16 by playing Tom Robinson’s record Glad to Be Gay very loudly four times in a row. Once out, however, things unravelled for him. “I had a mental crisis after I came out,” he says. “I think, for some time, I hadn’t been open about my sexuality and when I was, there was a release of inner tension, and that became a crisis.”He attempted suicide and was diagnosed with clinical depression he was admitted to St Andrews psychiatric hospital in Northampton. “Life seemed to be pretty futile, and I just couldn’t see why you would want to do it.”Depression has been a constant companion for Coles. “I’ve never felt as desolate as I felt then,” he says. “But you look around the world sometimes and wonder why you wouldn’t be depressed. But there’s so much to not be depressed about too.”It would be some time before he found the church. He moved to London in the 1980s, immersing himself in the city’s growing gay scene. He met Bronski Beat’s Jimmy Somerville in Gay’s The Word bookshop in Bloomsbury. Although Coles didn’t harbour an ambition to be a pop star, he had been a choirboy and played saxophone at school, and Somerville asked him to join the band. In 1985, they broke away and formed the Communards.“I didn’t particularly want to be a pop star, so when it came along it was never something I longed for, and never something I couldn’t imagine not doing,” he says. “I was stupid and I had a lot of money I didn’t really do anything with, so I just spent it on lots of ecstasy.”His soaring success with the Communards in the late 80s was marred by the HIV epidemic. Coles had a scare when he was diagnosed with shingles, a viral condition often associated with HIV. He had a test and waited the necessary 10 days for the results. During that period he had a fierce row with Somerville – their relationship was notoriously tempestuous – in which he told the singer that he was HIV positive. He also told many of his friends. But the test result came back negative.Is it his biggest regret? “It was not my finest hour,” he says, “and it was tough asking people for forgiveness for having done it, but they did, actually. Of course I regret it.”Coles lost many friends during the HIV epidemic, including the gay activist Mark Ashton, who was portrayed in the 2014 film Pride. “Half the people you knew died,” he says. “They’d be dead in a week. It was just so traumatic. We were so young. I really still miss some of the people. Mark Ashton – what would he have become? So many men were in their 20s and 30s. God knows what they would have been. I just wish they hadn’t died.”The epidemic brought Coles closer to God, in a similar way, he says, to the spike in the number of men who sought ordination after the second world war. He spent much of his youth as an atheist (even setting up an atheist society at school), but after the years of fame, drugs and grief, he consulted a psychiatrist, who suggested he see a priest.Something struck him he later did a degree in theology and in 2003 was selected to train for the priesthood in the Church of England. Does he ever see a tension between his past and present lives? “As a punk-inspired homosexual pop star, I think vicar actually kind of works, really,” he says. “It’s very countercultural now. It really is, and there’s something continuous between the two things. Although perhaps not everyone will see it that way.” Certainly, Coles is a great performer and public speaker.He says he never had any issue reconciling his faith and his sexuality – being gay was just “a variation on the universal theory of human sexuality” – and he has had nothing but support from his congregation and his C of E bosses (although some parishioners did leave Finedon when he was appointed vicar in 2011). The Church of England’s stance on LGBT equality, in particular same-sex marriage, has left Coles struggling to represent it at times, however.When news of his partner’s death broke, Coles received homophobic letters and emails rejoicing in his loss. “One began, ‘I cannot begin to tell you how glad I am to hear the news that David has died,’” he recalls. “The funny thing is, it didn’t affect me at all because I had enough real shit to be dealing with.”The police took the letters, assuring Coles that he had been the victim of a hate crime, although an investigation came to nothing.It was through the church that Coles met his partner, after giving a sermon. David, who was 15 years his junior, approached him after a service and said there were some spiritual questions he would like to talk over.“From the minute we met – boom!” Coles says. “I never for a minute thought – no matter what happened – we would ever part.”The couple became civil partners in 2011. “He said that if I didn’t make an honest man of him, he would go off with somebody else.”Coles laments the fact that he couldn’t marry David. The Church of England forbids same-sex marriage and doing so could have led to both men losing their bishop’s licence, which allowed them to work as priests – they planned to wait until they had retired. Even in a civil partnership, priests must commit to celibacy. “It’s just ridiculous but it’s where we are,” says Coles, who has always spoken candidly about the fact that he and David were celibate. “It kind of worked and it was OK for us, it sort of suited our lives. But I minded having to.”Asked what David was like, Coles says his partner brought out the best in him. “I have to be right, and think things through, and work out my position,” says Coles.“David would have none of that. Sometimes, he thought I was a pompous dick. I’d never had anyone tell me that before. He saved me from the worst things of myself. For some reason, I could take it from him in ways I couldn’t from other people.“The biggest row we ever had was the day Margaret Thatcher died,” he says. “I gave a whoop of triumph. To me, ‘ding-dong the witch is dead’ was the thing. I hated her all my adult life. He gave me a real bollocking about that.”David had bought a burial plot long before his death – and one for a bemused Coles. “He came home one day, and he said: ‘I’ve bought our graves.’ I said: ‘Why did you do that?’ He said: ‘It’s a northern thing.’”Does being a vicar make it any easier to handle death? “Christianity doesn’t get you out of death,” says Coles. “It just says there’s something beyond it. But it doesn’t get you out of loss or grief, or bereavement. It doesn’t spare you any of that. On the contrary, I think it probably intensifies it.”What does he think David would make of him giving an interview about grief to a national newspaper? “He would be rude about it,” says Coles, laughing. “He would go, ‘It’s not about you.’ He was very good, though. He knew that I needed to have the fires of my rampant ego stoked. And he was always very supportive of that.”Despite losing his partner so abruptly, so young, Coles’ faith has not been tested. “It’s not been a religious sort of thing at all,” says Coles. “I’ve never had any sense of him being in heaven and looking down, checking my behaviour. I don’t sense him in the room … none of that at all. He’s just not here.“But I am a Christian and I don’t think this is all there is. Everything that was good about me and David, that’s not finished. Nothing in that has flickered or faded at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

If they are looking for a less tedious way to stay relevant, here’s an idea: put Dolly Parton on the cover for her 75th birthday.In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia, Parton made it clear she has no plans of retiring – in fact, she wants to be on the cover of Playboy for her next birthday.“It would be such a hoot, I don’t know if they’ll go for it,” she said.Playboy, which has been trying to capitalize on gender equality in the past few years, should seriously consider the offer. If Parton made the cover a second time (she had her first cover at 32), she would become the oldest woman to do so, after Jane Seymour, who posed at 67 in 2018. Not that age should matter, of course, but for Playboy, it seems it does – the average age of a Playboy model in 2010 was 25. Parton, 74, is a successful woman happy in life, love and work and although she doesn’t like to call herself a feminist, she has drawn great attention to women’s struggle for workplace equality. Her musical adaptation of 9 to 5 spoke to how entitled men feel to women’s bodies indeed, Parton herself has come a long way since journalists thought it was OK to ask what her measurements were in interviews.When Parton last appeared on the cover of Playboy, she did so after rejecting offers to pose nude several times. She eventually agreed, but stayed clothed. She later said that going nude “was so totally not me. I would never do that … it was just a fun thing to do.”But while Parton is clear about her own boundaries around nudity, it seems Playboy is not. In 2015, when Hugh Hefner was still alive, Playboy made the decision to get rid of its nude covers. In 2018, Playboy announced it would go back to having nude covers and then in 2019, Playboy re-branded again with a team of millennials it hoped would help it to stay relevant.And sure, there shouldn’t be a problem with the mag trying to keep up with the times – only, Playboy hasn’t even tried to conceal how its newfound wokeness is a shallow form of piggybacking. During the rebrand, the photographer Ryan Pfluger told the New York Times he was asked to shoot Ezra Miller but “make it queer”. Playboy’s new head of marketing even told the Times what their new strategy was, saying: “Look, I think the target audience is ‘Let’s be relevant’.”So it’s a wonder that anyone is still interested in Playboy, let alone Parton. And yet, as America’s national treasure, she stands a solid chance of making them cool again. Plus, Parton reckons she might still fit that same outfit from her 1978 cover: “My boobs are still the same!” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e668b0b7f2afdd4cb81795a44f6fde7fff6c5f2a/1348_571_2219_1331/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6498c8a6c8e7ef4fab1495a501f5991a","title":"hadley freeman search uncover family secrets podcast","story":"When Hadley Freeman found an old shoebox full of pictures and documents in the back of a wardrobe, it began a quest to find the real story of her family’s history and her grandmother’s escape to America from the Nazis.

Whatever the outcome of Labour’s inquiry into his Islamophobia, there’s no denying he has a case to answer.”Phillips released a copy of the letter announcing his suspension, in which Labour cited prior statements including his reference to UK Muslims being “a nation within a nation” and comments observing how few wore Remembrance Day poppies.He has condemned the suspension, which he claimed was a form of political gangsterism from the party under Jeremy Corbyn. Phillips has been severely critical of the Labour leader in the past, particularly on his handling of antisemitism in the party.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Phillips said he was surprised and dismayed by the move, and defended his comments about British Muslims.“I’m kind of surprised that what is and always has been an open and democratic party decides that its members cannot have a healthy debate about how we address differences of values and outlook,” he said.“They say I am accusing Muslims of being different. Well, actually, that’s true. The point is Muslims are different. And in many ways I think that’s admirable.”Muslims were a multiracial group “united by a faith and a belief” and as such could not be treated as a race, he told Today. He rejected the contention that his comments amounted to sweeping generalisations about a disparate population of approximately 3 million Britons.It was correct for Muslims to be judged collectively, he argued. “You keep saying that I make these generalisations,” he said. “But the truth is, if you do belong to a group, whether it is a church, or a football club, you identify with a particular set of values, and you stand for it. And frankly you are judged by that.”The Labour backbencher Khalid Mahmood said the allegations against Phillips were “so outlandish as to bring disrepute on all involved in making them”.But Naz Shah MP, the shadow minister for women and equalities and vice chair of the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, said Phillips’ remarks and the subsequent defence of him by some of her colleagues had made her extremely angry.She said those who claimed his suspension was malicious should think carefully about whether they were contributing to real fears felt by Muslims in Britain.“Some of the things he has said on public record would not be acceptable to any minority community,” she said.Referring to his 2016 comment that the centre of gravity of British Muslim opinion was “some distance away from the centre of gravity of everybody else’s”, Shah said: “What if we said that about women or another minority community? What does he mean by that?“I’m confident the Labour party will deal with this complaint robustly as it should with any complaint.”Miqdaad Versi, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), said he found Phillips’ comments on Muslims “seriously problematic”.Versi told Today his organisation had not made a complaint to Labour, but added: “What we can say very clearly is that the statements he has made on a number of different things would not be statements that he would make against other communities.”Phillips, who chaired the EHRC when it launched in 2006, was among 24 public figures who wrote to the  last year to declare their refusal to vote for Labour because of its association with antisemitism.Last week, a dossier of more than 300 allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative party was submitted to the EHRC by the MCB, increasing pressure on the watchdog to launch a formal investigation.A Labour spokesperson said: “The party takes all complaints about Islamophobia extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a4b3121e2806604f73e60d6935d0c33f323abe/46_0_2799_1680/master/2799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39346033fa0ab6b1859b579cb41bbc68","title":"did you solve it are you a master of reflection","story":"The answer’s to today’s colouring puzzlesEarlier today I set you the following puzzle:Here’s a square ided into eight segments, and the four ‘mirror lines’ of that square.

After more than 60 years’ teaching experience between us, we decided to apply to be foster carers.Working with teenagers kept us young at heart, but the first question we asked the county council was: “Are we too old?” We were fast approaching 60, but there’s no age limit for fostering, just a medical to get through – which fortunately we did.We took a “Skills to Foster” course and learned about different types of fostering, including looking after unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC). These young people are in particular need of a place of safety and a loving family, as many have no family or friends in the country when they arrive after what is usually a long, traumatic journey. Meeting UASC foster carers and hearing about their experiences made us even more interested.Our training process ended with a panel interview. They seemed inordinately interested in the fact that we have a roast dinner every Sunday, and asked what we’d do if a child didn’t want to eat it. We must have given the right answer, as we passed.A few weeks later our assessing social worker came around with information on some possible placements, including a 14-year-old UASC. This young man, Salim*, was the best match. Three years later, he is still with us.Before meeting us, Salim was given a booklet we’d prepared about our home and family. He visited with his temporary foster carer and a friend from his country to translate, and he decided to be with us. We received a note from his foster carer, introducing herself and offering advice, as she’s been a UASC foster carer for many years. We’ve been in regular contact ever since, and she’s even provided respite care. Such friendship and camaraderie is a great support.Salim arrived with all his belongings, which fitted into one suitcase and a bag. His English was better than we’d expected (he’d only been in England for about five months). We made ourselves understood with mime and Google Translate. That first evening over dinner he called us Mum and Dad. We told him he should call us by our first names, and he responded: “No, new Mum, new Dad.” I welled up.He was very bemused when asked the usual parental questions about where he was going, who with, and when he’d be home. His reply – “Too many questions, Mum. You should be working at the Home Office!” – demonstrated his cheeky sense of humour. We had to admit, he managed to travel more than 5,000 miles to get to England, so should be able to get home after a day out with friends. There’s still much we don’t know about Salim’s previous life. Details are given at unexpected moments, like watching the news and hearing him say “I was there” (Calais jungle) or “I did that” (refugees jumping on the back of a lorry). It’s astonishing he is coping so well after all he’s been through.Fostering a UASC is different to fostering a British child. There are no access visits or phone calls home. In most cases families cannot be contacted, and may not even know their child has arrived at a place of safety. The British Red Cross is sometimes able to bring messages to families, but only if it’s safe.One of the great joys has been the improvement in Salim’s English. Some people find it hard to believe he’s only been here three years. He comes up with some lovely phrases. In a birthday card he wrote: “You are the best mum because you have a unique gift, you manage to be encouraging and annoying at the same time.” Salim has also learned about the world in general. He’s from a rural area with no electricity and didn’t attend school or watch TV. When he first arrived, he kept asking “Is that real?” when we watched nature programmes. He’d never heard of polar ice caps or volcanos.Our education is continuing, too. As foster carers we are expected to keep our skills up to date. Our county council provides courses on coping with mental health issues, Aids, adolescence, radicalisation and preparation for adult life.There are monthly support groups held by social workers, which are a great way to catch up with other carers, and sometimes include talks by relevant agencies. We have found the new UASC group and training specifically for UASC carers particularly useful. We’re members of the United Foster Carers’ Association, a charity providing advice and support, which also organises social events for children in care and their families.We’re not on our own: social workers are available via phone or email. We have regular meetings, and I email both our social worker and Salim’s a weekly summary of significant events.We also had an amazing solicitor who helped Salim through the process of gaining refugee status. He’ll have to go through this stressful experience again when his initial five years are up. Salim is one of the family. He attended both our birth children’s weddings and was in the family group photos, and sat at the top table with us. We recently celebrated our three years together at a theme park. At Salim’s request our daughter came, too. She calls him little brother, even though he’s six foot tall, and he calls her little sister, despite her being 10 years older.He adapted well to British life and food but we have to ensure it’s Halal. We even managed to source a Halal turkey for Christmas. Unfortunately, Salim didn’t eat it he’d decided he didn’t like roast dinners.Salim is nearly 18, but won’t be leaving us. He’s chosen the “staying put” option, which enables children in care to remain with their foster carers if all parties agree. After all, what parents turf their children out as soon as they reach legal adulthood?We have a second spare bedroom. Could it be a good time to welcome another young person into our family?* Not his real name"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcd4b6441001f901ad890b12f3c5a6b11d7c1c0/0_162_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb9d26de849f4d499f685cb357dc2b6","title":"all sport italy suspended until 3 april coronavirus serie a","story":"All domestic sporting activity at all levels in Italy has been suspended until 3 April at the earliest, the Italian national Olympic committee (CONI) has announced.This includes all matches in Serie A, Italy’s highest football ision, but CONI does not speak for Italian clubs or national teams competing in international competitions such as the Champions League.

Marler will attend a disciplinary hearing on Thursday and if found guilty he can expect a ban of at least 12 weeks.Marler may hope the length of any suspension is reduced for mitigating factors but his list of previous transgressions would count against him and a 12-week ban would make him unavailable for the start of England’s summer tour of Japan if Harlequins do not reach the Premiership play-offs. That would in turn raise questions over whether he has played his last match for England. The disciplinary panel may also take a dim view of Marler’s tweet on Sunday in which he wrote: “Bollocks. Complete bollocks.”Courtney Lawes has also been cited for a dangerous tackle on Jones in the second half of England’s 33-30 victory and he too faces a Six Nations disciplinary hearing on Thursday, as does Manu Tuilagi following his red card for a shoulder to George North’s head. The Six Nations has not yet taken any action against Eddie Jones for his stinging criticism of the referee Ben O’Keeffe over Tuilagi’s sending off.World Rugby does not intend to intervene – it considers the issue a matter for the Six Nations – but Jones could also face an investigation by the Rugby Football Union. In 2005 the then England head coach Andy Robinson was investigated by the RFU’s disciplinary officer at the time, Jeff Blackett, for disparaging comments made about the referee Jonathan Kaplan.Marler’s bizarre incident with Alun Wyn Jones was caught on camera and quickly went viral during the match. It has polarised opinion – dismissed as a light-hearted attempt to wind-up the Wales captain in some quarters and met with condemnation in others. Jones, for his part, took issue with the incident, calling on the authorities to act, and Marler has now been cited under World Rugby’s law that states players must not “grab, twist or squeeze the genitals”. While examples of similar incidents are rare, the London Irish lock George Robson was banned for six weeks in 2016 for grabbing an opponent’s testicles.If it does prove to be Marler’s last England appearance it would be a disappointing way to bow out, if not entirely out of character for the 29-year-old. He retired from international rugby in September 2018 but reversed the decision last summer and played his part in England reaching the World Cup final. This Six Nations, however, he has established himself as England’s first-choice loosehead prop.Lawes, meanwhile, faces a ban of at least six weeks after his dangerous tackle made contact with Jones’s head. The incident occurred in the 66th minute and Jones required treatment. Lawes will hope for mitigation but he could miss Northampton’s Champions Cup quarter-final at Exeter on 4 April. Tuilagi is also facing a six-week ban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adea1a1bfba6d02628ccb2e5ce8ce6db67921573/299_23_1277_766/master/1277.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2a22d98a3a4aa71fe6ef547c458fba8","title":"always on my mind tim vine elvis obsession and his presley one liner","story":"The comedian, who always wanted to be a pop star, is finally getting the chance with his new show paying homage to the KingIf you were to list the comedians who would rather be a rock star, who would you pick? Tim Minchin and Nick Helm seem dead certs. In his show Reset, James Acaster suggests there was a musical road not taken.But pun-meister general Tim Vine would be near the bottom of my list . After all, to pun is to be clean and wholesome, witty and precise – not exactly rock’n’roll is it? The phrase isn’t “sex, drugs’n’clever wordplay”.Yet, it turns out that Vine is a hound dog for Elvis Presley – so much so that he is taking an Elvis tribute act on tour this spring, complete with five-piece band, quiffed wig and a plastic suit that’s entirely unbreathable. But before we get on to Vine’s Elvis obsession – and it is an obsession – it must be noted that this brief pivot to music makes perfect sense to Vine. He speaks wistfully about his galloping youth when he was a prolific songwriter, and his cache of unreleased songs that is vast enough to make Prince look creatively constipated.Suddenly, his performance for Comic Relief in 2013 makes perfect sense – Vine donned a dapper white suit and did his best Justin Timberlake impression to whooping from the audience. But it is Elvis who runs through his veins. “I’ve been in to Elvis since I was 10 or 11, so this is a tribute act that is 40 years in the making. We tried it a few times, did it one night in Edinburgh to 500 people, and it worked well, people seemed to really enjoy it.”Since those shows, Vine has been developing his best workable impression of Elvis. This largely involves “a lot of leg work”, and perfecting the famous Mississippi drawl (apparently the word “fantastic” is a good in for this). There was a scare over Christmas when Vine put his knee out doing panto in Croydon, the result of some over-enthusiastic conga dancing, but he and his band are now back in the rehearsal room and fine-tuning the setlist. The aim, Vine says, is to do a fun but respectful show: “There are funny bits in it, but it is a concert not a standup show, and I hold him in too high esteem to do crass jokes about burgers or him dying.”As you might imagine of an Elvis superfan, Vine has accumulated plenty of memorabilia in his home in Sutton, south-west London – indeed there is a picture of Elvis in every room. But Vine has one prized possession above them all: a lock of hair that belonged to “The King”. Probably. “I bought it in a shop in Manchester, it cost about £200. It’s less than an inch in length, and the colour of it is interesting, it looks almost ginger – I mean if you’re faking it you’d make sure it stayed jet black wouldn’t you? The pigmentation of the dye in this one has completely gone.”It’s an indication of Vine’s commitment to the cause. With an estimated 400,000 Elvis impersonators worldwide he’s entering a flooded market, and is probably wise to be returning to his usual gag-packed shows this summer. So does he have any Elvis one-liners? “Just the one,” he says. “Elvis was getting out of his swimming pool for the 10th time. Priscilla said, ‘What are you doing?’ He said, ‘I can’t help falling in, love.’ Just don’t expect to hear that, I’ll be in character.”• Tim Vine tours Plastic Elvis around the UK from 1 May-30 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baa04126679835d058e611b9705e5d0f72054e8/0_128_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25ba1df190d0d06bd26f8ef6d375c212","title":"miriams big fat adventure review is stigma the weightiest issue for britains obese bbc","story":"The actor and national institution delved into changing attitudes to weight, in a show that took in stigma, mental health and other heavy issues besidesThe main takeaway and perhaps the only true insight to be gained from Miriam’s Big Fat Adventure, a two-part documentary, in which the actor and Great British Institution Miriam Margolyes set out to anatomise cultural attitudes to fatness and the rise of the body-positivity movement, comes in the opening minutes. “I’m happy with who I am,” says Margolyes. “I’m happy with my face, I’m happy with my life. I am disgusted with my body. I loathe it. If I could migrate the whole of my personality and face on to another body, I’d be delighted.”It is a better indication than anything that follows of the depths of the tyranny of thinness. If this 78-year-old iconoclast and hogshead of talent squeezed into a pint pot has been unable to avoid internalising the absurd yet absurdly endemic social prejudice harboured against the carrying of excess fat, what chance do any of us have?The programme suffered from the same problem faced by Kathy Burke’s similar series All Woman last year. Both squandered the gift of having a warm, intelligent and unusually direct presenter (though, unexpectedly, Margolyes seemed to pull her punches slightly throughout – both more than you thought she would and more than Burke did) by never really pulling it all together into any kind of overarching critique. Both women excel at drawing out stories from interviewees and commenting thereafter, but their programmes fail to create a sense of the systemic problems at work.Margolyes started off with a visit to a health farm-cum-bootcamp run by ex-marine Craig and his wife Paula. Paula was one of the many people Margolyes met who associate their mental health problems (current or past) with their size and weight, though – in this first episode at least – the link between the two (correlation? causal? in which direction?) was barely addressed. Similarly, despite a plethora of decades-old remembered slights and comments – often during adolescence – that cut to the quick, the question of how much social attitudes aggravate the problem once it is established was never properly pursued. The segment where a psychologist researched the matter (which included one of his volunteers walking around town in a fat suit and returning to say nothing of any import whatsoever) was banal in the extreme.One camp attendee – a habitual binge-eater at home – described the benefit of the place and its controlled environment as enabling residents “to realise what your body actually needs”. This was, effectively, a point about living in a modern, obesogenic environment and, indirectly, about who is responsible for creating and now for dismantlingresisting that. Do we follow the money and blame the (processed) food, sugar, corn syrup industries or the government and its regulations of these areas? Or does responsibility and culpability only ever lie with iniduals and how much willpower they can or cannot muster in the face of temptation?Which was a point – or points – surely worth picking up on. Especially later, when Margolyes was in conversation with body-positive activists who tend, amid valid denunciations of the cultural politics of being fat and the way fat people are treated, not to be able to deal so effectively with the scientific evidence of the physical ill-effects of obesity. The question of whether we can admit there is such a thing as a healthy weight (ie one that enables rather than hinders the smooth functioning of vital organs and allows the full range of bodily movement you might reasonably expect to deploy in an average day), while also rejecting the notion than anyone should be shamed, was not fully considered, as we teleported between ideas without ever tracing the possible routes between them.But it was, at least, effective testimony to the Herculean task before anyone unhappy with their size in 2020. This was largely down to Margolyes’s honesty about her own feelings and experiences, and the time she spent talking to fellow camp attendees and the loved ones affected by their weight andor disordered eating. Georgia’s mother in particular symbolised the grief and helplessness felt by anyone who has to watch someone they love behave in ways that make them unhappy but which are beyond external control. And, ultimately, there was a clear message: whether you learn to lose weight or to accept it, modern times, modern supermarkets and modern culture are not there to help."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671593e6a96a5da3afc6f3626dea7e1b7b1dd721/0_318_1605_962/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4327ee5e252886c0e51211590497236a","title":"the fast show returns to tv for one off special nice","story":"Stars of 90s comedy favourite to reunite for ‘retrospective with a twist’“Brilliant!” fans of 90s comedy might shout again, as the Fast Show is to return to TV for a one-off special to be broadcast on UKTV’s Gold.The “retrospective with a twist”, titled The Fast Show: Just A Load Of Blooming Catchphrases, will feature its stars Paul Whitehouse, Arabella Weir, John Thomson, Charlie Higson, Mark Williams and Simon Day being interviewed about the programme’s history and legacy while in character.Originally launched in 1994, The Fast Show ran until 1999, introducing audiences to sketches including the travels of the over-enthusiastic youth known as Brilliant Kid, the awkward friendship of groundskeeper Ted and aristocrat Ralph, the innuendo-loving “suits you, sir” tailors, and sleazy car dealer Swiss Toni.The programme was resurrected by beer company Foster’s for an online series in 2011, with the sketches later repackaged into two specials for the BBC in 2014.

She said he recently changed classrooms, which triggered him.What exactly happened in the classroom isn’t known. Harmon says the school called her but by the time she arrived her son had been taken to a mental health facility. She said he was examined and released four hours later. Showing her marks on his wrists, he told her he was handcuffed before being driven away in a police car.“To handcuff him and put him in the backseat – not only did you handcuff him but you did it so tightly that it left marks on his hands and he’s seven. What’s he going to do? He’s seven and in the backseat,” Harmon told WFTS-TV.Pinellas county officials issued a statement defending the officer, saying Harmon’s son “was engaging in dangerous activity that could have hurt the student or others.“Please know that restraint of students is only used as a last resort when other interventions have not resolved the issue. The safety, health and wellbeing of our students and staff is our highest priority.”Video released last month showed an Orlando reserve police officer arresting six-year-old Kaia Rolle, whose wrists were zip tied before she was led begging and crying to a patrol car.She had kicked and punched staff members but had calmed down before officers arrived. The officer was fired for not following department policy, which requires the approval of superiors before arresting any child under 12.The Florida House passed a measure last week that would require police agencies adopt policies regulating the arrest of anyone under 10.

The final straw appeared to be being insulted on his podcast this week. As Trump and Pence held their press conference regarding coronavirus response Monday evening, House speaker Nancy Pelosi released a list of priorities democrats have related to the virus. Those priorities include paid sick leave and enhanced unemployment insurance for those who cannot work or lose work because of the epidemic, measures to support food security, and anti-price gouging protections for medical and non-medical essentials during the emergency. She also advocated to increase the capacity of the medical system and provide affordable treatment for all as the virus continues to spread. Donald Trump spoke at a press briefing regarding coronavirus response on Monday. He said his administration is proposing measures including working with hourly wage earners to ensure they can take time off and creating loans for small businesses so they can weather the coronavirus outbreak.“This is something we were thrown into and we have been handling it”, Trump said. The moves come as the economy has been in a nosee and coronavirus spreads around the globe. Trump also proposed a payroll tax he said he will discuss on Tuesday with the Senate. “We are going to take care of, and have been taking care of, the American public and the American economy”, he said. Trump said he will hold another press conference on Tuesday to announce “major” economic measures he will work with the Senate to create.“They will be very dramatic,” he said. “We have a very strong economy but this has blindsided the world, I think we have handled it very well,” he said.Trump has taken the stage at the task force press briefing. Republican Rep Gohmert of Texas is refusing to quarantine himself despite interacting with someone at CPAC who has been diagnosed with coronavirus. This comes despite several of his colleagues quarantining out of an abundance of caution.

More members of Congress are now quarantining themselves after potentially being put in contact with the coronavirus. Rep.

Here’s where the day stands so far:Kari will have more coming up, so stay tuned.The nosee marks the Dow’s worst day since 2008, at the start of the Great Recession.For more updates on coronavirus, follow the ’s live blog:Congressman Matt Gaetz is now also self-quarantining after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus.The Florida Republican and close Trump ally attracted attention last week for wearing a gas mask on to the House floor to vote on the $8 billion coronavirus bill.But Gaetz’s statement on his self-quarantine claimed he wore the gas mask to illustrate the depth of his concern around the spread of the virus.“Congressman Gaetz had expected COVID-19 to impact Congress, given the elevated frequency of travel and human contact, and demonstrated his concern last week on the House Floor,” the statement reads.Gaetz also flew back to Washington with Trump on Air Force One today, marking another interaction between the president and someone who has since gone into self-quarantine.Another Republican lawmaker who attended CPAC is self-quarantining after interacting with a person who tested positive for coronavirus.Congressman Doug Collins said he was not experiencing symptoms but was going to self-quaratine “out of an abundance of caution.”Collins also shook hands with Trump on Friday as the president traveled to the congressman’s home state of Georgia to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0423aab395e588566738a55caff1665d0c06d2a/0_0_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859c5cd1b667f5bf12ceb9a64db043e3","title":"tell us how is coronavirus affecting your day to day life","story":"We want to hear about how coronavirus has impacted your daily life.

Our future is in our hands.”“I am going to sign a decree that can be summarised as follows: I stay at home,” he said. “The whole of Italy will become a protected zone.”Under the decree, all public events will be banned, cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs closed, and funerals, weddings and sporting events cancelled. All schools and universities will remain closed until 3 April.“The figures show we are experiencing a serious increase in infections, an increase in people hospitalized in intensive care – and an increase, unfortunately, in deaths. We need to change our lifestyle. We need to change it now. That’s why I have decided to adopt these hard measures,” said Conte.Under the new decree, people will only be able to travel between cities for emergency reasons and can face fines and up to three months in jail for breaking quarantine rules.Checkpoints on motorways, toll booths, train stations and airports are expected to be introduced on Tuesday.Those who have to leave their region or their cities out of serious necessity can do so only if they have self-certification stating that they must cross the borders for compelling business reasons, health reasons, or because they have to return home.On Sunday, the whole of Lombardy, including the financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, were shut down until 3 April, as Italy experienced its highest day-on-day rise in deaths from coronavirus.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The country was plunged into chaos after details of the plan were leaked to the press, sending thousands into panic as they tried to flee.Thousands crowded train stations or jumped into their cars after a draft decree banning people from leaving or entering the region was revealed by Corriere della Sera late on Saturday afternoon.Meanwhile, hospitals in Lombardy were beginning to run out of beds. Health authorities were struggling to find space and beds in intensive care units. To manage the emergency, the sick are being placed in operating rooms and hospital corridors.“I am very concerned,” said Prof Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Sacco hospital in Milan. “The pressure on hospitals in Lombardy these days is enormous. I am very, very worried about the impact the virus will have on our health system.”There are about 500 available beds for intensive care in Lombardy’s public health sphere, with another 160 in private care facilities. Despite a massive effort to locate additional space there are still not enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f19da0673e187942d9cff8cd89b53864e3c21b/0_289_9000_5399/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7821f56500f05d7c4333f45d8b27756","title":"coronavirus symptoms what doctor china covid 19","story":"What is Covid-19, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and at what point should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 9 March, more than 110,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have over 3,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. 62,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39d4f950f096f291bc05d785d6cc101e1faf141/0_196_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41037f7d0339d6fd863e313665e7dd8f","title":"dresden palace guards investigated alleged role heist","story":"Prosecutors believe accomplices at museum may have been involved in theftFour security guards employed at Dresden’s Royal Palace are under investigation over their alleged involvement in a huge theft of 18th-century jewellery, according to German prosecutors.Investigators have long suspected that the heist, the biggest since the second world war, was carried out with accomplices working inside the museum. According to prosecutors, the suspects include two security guards who were on duty in the early hours of the morning on 25 November, when the theft took place. Investigators say they did not “react adequately” when it became clear there had been a break in, and did nothing to prevent the theft.Prosecutors believe that two other security guards may have helped the thieves. They believe that one, who was arrested on 29 November, may have passed on information about the layout of the rooms in the Grünes Gewölbe (Green Vault), as well as information regarding the museum’s security system. A fourth security guard whose flat has been searched by police is suspected by prosecutors of meddling with the alarm system.Jürgen Schmidt, the chief prosecutor, told the Bild newspaper: “The suspects have behaved cooperatively and initially said they wanted to speak to investigators, but subsequently they reserved their right to silence.”Seven people are believed to have been involved in the robbery.The Green Vault holds one of Europe’s largest collections of art treasures. The items taken included three sets of diamonds, which were said by the museum’s directors to be of “immeasurable worth”. Some experts have estimated them to be valued at around €1bn. If they were broken up, they would still probably fetch around €100m-€200m. The director of Dresden’s state art collections, Marion Ackermann, urged the thieves not to break the collections into pieces, saying “the material value doesn’t reflect the historic meaning”.The robbery took place after a fire broke out at an electrical distribution point, deactivating the museum’s electricity supply and its alarm system.A surveillance camera filmed two men breaking into the Green Vault by smashing a window, cutting through a metal grate and smashing a display cabinet. A burning car found in a carpark is believed to have been used as a getaway vehicle.The Green Vault consists of 10 rooms containing around 3,000 items of jewellery and other masterpieces. The building was heavily damaged during the second world war, but has since been successfully restored, reopening to huge acclaim in 2006.Michael Kretschmer, the leader of Saxony, of which Dresden is the capital, said at the time of the theft that “not only has the gallery been robbed, but also the Saxonian people”.The theft was the second high-profile heist in Germany in recent years, after a 100kg, 24-carat gold coin was stolen from Berlin’s Bode Museum in 2017.In 2003, £100m in diamonds were stolen from the Diamond Centre in Antwerp, Belgium. Some of the diamonds have since been recovered.A thief in Cannes made off with over £90m in jewels in a 2013 smash and grab at a temporary exhibition in the Carlton Hotel, where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch a Thief. The jewels have yet to be found.In 2005, a £58m diamond theft took place at Amsterdam’s Schipol airport. Though the police have recovered some, £43m worth of diamonds are still unaccounted for.In 2008, Harry Winston’s boutique near Paris’ Champs-Elysees was raided by a group of men in make-up, who lifted £56m of gems and watches.In 2009, Graff’s Diamond Store in Mayfair was stripped of its rings and diamonds worth more than £40m. It is likely that the jewels have been broken down and sold onto unregulated international markets.\u0026nbspOliver Taylor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28cd08b7f867b2c35a62e528cf7cffd3a9e5a97/0_88_1292_775/master/1292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bea27829480daca0d8f1e696fae93de3","title":"foreign office urged to bring in total ban on travel from uk to italy","story":"Tourists already in country scramble to return as lockdown extendedThe Foreign Office has warned British residents against all but essentialtravel to Italy after coronavirus quarantine measures were extended throughout the country.It said in a statement: “We have amended our travel advice to recommend against all but essential travel to Italy. The safety of British nationals is always our number one priority.“The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to the Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days.”Italy had initially imposed a quarantine on Sunday on northern regions that are home to 16 million people, where the outbreak began. On Monday evening the PM extended those restrictions on travel and public gatherings to the whole country.Hundreds of British tourists were scrambling to get home from the north of the country on Monday – a situation that is expected to worsen now that the whole country is locked down.Despite travel restrictions for Italians, planes continued to fly passengers between the country’s locked-down region and the UK.The Foreign Office (FCO) is under pressure from the public and the travel industry to change its advice on Italy from advising against “all but essential” travel – creating ambiguity around whether insurers would pay out on cancelled trips – to bringing in a total ban.During a press conference on Monday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, defended a lack of screening for those newly arrived in Britain from northern Italy, saying that “temperature screening in an airport doesn’t really have much effect”.At Manchester airport, posters instructed new arrivals to self-isolate if they flew in from the locked-down region, but there were no checks, said Seana Corr, 27, from Wirral, after disembarking from a flight from Milan.Corr described Milan as a place where “everything has been cancelled”, adding: “There are no social gatherings any more. It’s all closed down … The streets are empty, people are out of work, the shops are empty because people have started stockpiling. Bars and restaurants are closed. There are no guards on the streets and children are playing out in the streets because they are not in school.”Tour operators Inghams and Crystal Ski both said they were working to bring all their customers home from ski resorts in northern Italy, where authorities announced that ski lifts had either been closed or were due to shut on Tuesday.The planned airlift involves a combination of charter flights and scheduled flights, and came as British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet cut the number of flights they operate to and from northern Italy after the lockdown of selected northern provinces.Inghams – which brought back hotel guests from the locked-down “red zone” of Lombardy on Sunday – said more than 600 customers would be brought home over the next 48 hours. They include guests from areas that had not been locked down, such as in the Aosta Valley ski region, where lifts closed on Sunday. Inghams was also contacting guests in the Dolomites ahead of lift closures on Tuesday.Angela Hall from Portsmouth, a customer of Crystal Ski, arrived in the Dolomites on Sunday, hours before she heard that authorities would be closing ski lifts.“I had seen on the news before we departed that there was a lockdown in a different region and called Crystal before leaving the UK but they said everything was fine,” she told the  from an airport-bound coach with others on Monday.While she was critical of Crystal Ski for not being as informative as she would have liked, other customers were much angrier at the company, which is owned by TUI.One group said two couples in their number had been contacted on Friday by Inghams to say the company had drawn on Public Health England advice to decide it was no longer safe to bring them to the resort of Selva and would be issuing full refunds.But Meg Evans, who was in the group, said there had been no communication from Crystal Ski and it eventually responded to say it was still awaiting formal guidance from the Foreign Office, even when the couples pointed out that the hotel they were due to stay in had been the subject of a outbreak of coronavirus among a dozen guests.“We’re really quite angry at how it was handled. Three of our group are GPs and couldn’t possibly risk being out of action at a time when the NHS would need them later on at home,” she said, adding that some of the couples had now paid for a second holiday this week in France.Crystal Ski said it was planning to to get customers back to the UK as soon as possible after restrictions were put in place by local authorities in a number of ski resorts. Refunds would be given for the days of holidays missed out on.The British embassy in Rome, meanwhile, was the focus of sustained lobbying on social media by British people asking the FCO to alter its travel advice on Italy to specifically warn against all travel to certain regions, rather than currently advising against “all but essential travel” to a number of selected locked-down areas.Some commenters complained that insurers and airlines were holding off on responding or paying out for cancelled school trips and other visits.Carolyn Spinks, CEO of the UK tour operators to Italy (ABTOI) industry body, said that tour operators felt it would be “helpful if the FCO put its money where its mouth was” by simply warning against all travel to areas affected by coronavirus without any caveats.

Add to this the falling demand and disruption created by coronavirus and it is reasonable to expect many businesses will not survive.”The government has categorically ruled out extending the Brexit transition period, with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, saying there was no need for that to happen under any circumstances.But Nandy argued that Johnson’s government had left itself without options. “The government has boxed itself into a corner by legislating to end the transition period in December come what may,” she said.She argued that the government must “take a long-term approach to this crisis” and look to minimise uncertainty where it can, as Labour did during the 2008 financial crisis.And she suggested the Bank of England could also reduce interest rates and introduce a government-backed guarantee to ensure loans were provided to companies that fell into trouble.“We should immediately establish an emergency economic council and include those who have experience of dealing with the 2008 financial crisis, unions and business leaders to monitor the economic situation as it evolves – introducing further measures such as reducing VAT rates and allowing for payment holidays to keep firms afloat, as well as help for people at risk of losing their homes,” she wrote.Her other suggestions included extending statutory sick pay to avoid a “public health disaster waiting to happen” if self-employed people and those working in the “gig economy” could not afford to self-isolate, and a “Marshall plan” to protect over-65s, with a greater focus on social care and funding charities that help the vulnerable.Earlier on Monday, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the government should have acted sooner to protect the economy from the effects of coronavirus.“The prime minister should have called Cobra sooner. Days and hours matter when you are dealing with a crisis of this significance and urgency,” he said in a speech on Monday morning. “The chancellor also should have made clear immediately, 10 days ago, in a major public statement and to parliament that the government stood ready to do everything necessary to support our economy and to participate in global action to maintain market confidence … attempting to let out assuring noises in dribs and drabs is not enough and has proved to be not enough.”He also called for the coordination by the Treasury with the Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility and the business bodies and TUC of an overall and regular ongoing assessment of the potential impacts of the spread of the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b8cd3869ea874f609b56cbbb67c1fbc397c76e/0_102_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf522a7a4ce4fd90029f690fd90f474b","title":"russia network britons enemies vladimir putin report","story":"Exclusive: MPs who drew up Russia report suppressed by PM were told of ‘infiltration’Russia has been accused of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to help advance its criminal interests and to “go after” Vladimir Putin’s enemies in London, MPs who drew up the Russia report suppressed by Boris Johnson were told.In secret evidence submitted to parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC), the campaigner and financier Bill Browder claimed Moscow had been able to “infiltrate” UK society by using well-paid British intermediaries.Some had “reason to know exactly what they are doing and for whom”, Browder told the committee. Others “work unwittingly for Russian state interests”, he said.The alleged intermediaries include politicians from both Labour and the Conservative parties, former intelligence officers and diplomats, and leading public relations firms. Collectively, they form what Browder calls a “western buffer network”.There is no suggestion in Browder’s testimony that British citizens broke the law.The regime in Moscow uses these professionals to mask its “entangled” state and criminal interests, he alleged. It deploys them to attack Putin critics, “enhance Russian propaganda and disinformation” and to “facilitate and conceal massive money-laundering operations”, he said. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Browder’s claims false and “totally groundless”. Questions about corruption at the heart of the Russian state were “a perfect example of a maniac-style Russophobia”, Peskov said.With his permission, the  is publishing Browder’s previously confidential evidence to the ISC. The committee carried out a two-year investigation behind closed doors into how the Kremlin is seeking to influence and subvert UK politics and society. Its 50-page report was ready for release last November, before the election.The prime minister was accused of refusing to publish it.Downing Street cleared the document after the election. It claims the final document contains little new information and is underwhelming – although others who have read it disagree.Opposition MPs said Browder’s evidence demonstrated the need to publish the report as soon as possible.Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, wrote to Johnson a month ago asking for a timetable for the report’s publication, which requires Downing Street to appoint a new nine-member cross-party committee of MPs and peers.But nearly three months after the election, that process is only in its early stages, and it is likely to be a few weeks at least before the long-awaited report is able to be issued, partly because new members need to be vetted before they can sit.Browder was one of several expert witnesses invited to give evidence to MPs and peers. In September 2018 he submitted a 14-page statement, which included a number of recommendations.They include setting up a US-style register of iniduals working for foreign state interests, as well as extra resources for regulators, investigators, police and prosecutors. He calls on Companies House in London to review filings made by firms linked to Russian money-laundering scandals.Speaking to the , Browder said: “Yes, there are members of the Russian security services working out of the Russian embassy under diplomatic cover. What the government seems to be missing is the fact that there are all sorts of informal espionage networks.“There are Russian oligarchs who have a much greater impact on the security of this country. What’s most shocking is that the Russian government is indirectly hiring British nationals to assist them in its intelligence operations.”Browder argues that the Russian state and organised crime have in effect merged. Money stolen from the budget and private companies is used to enrich senior officials – including Putin – and to finance “black ops and special projects”, he told the ISC.The Kremlin has issued multiple Interpol warrants for Browder’s arrest and says he is a criminal. It has convicted him in absentia of tax evasion and deliberate bankruptcy. Browder says he is the victim of a vendetta by corrupt state officials. He denies all charges.Browder’s fund, Hermitage Capital Management, was once the biggest foreign investor in the Russian market. He fell out with the authorities after – he says – calling for a clean-up of companies in which Putin and his inner circle have financial interests. In 2005 Russia deported him from Moscow.Officials linked to the FSB spy agency subsequently stole $230m in taxes paid by the fund to the Russian treasury, Browder alleges. In 2009 his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in custody. Browder persuaded the US and some other western governments to sanction senior officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses.The Kremlin was furious. It paid British firms to “advance a false narrative of the fraud”, Browder told the ISC. One official allegedly involved, Andrey Pavlov, made an unsuccessful attempt to keep his name off a European parliament sanctions list, hiring the Labour former attorney general Lord Goldsmith to lobby on his behalf. Goldsmith’s law firm received a £75,000 fee, Browder claims.The firm, Debevoise \u0026amp Plimpton, said it could not comment on confidential client matters but that Pavlov denied wrongdoing. It added: “Everyone is entitled to legal representation. Debevoise provides legal representation consistent with the profession’s best traditions of integrity and probity. We will continue fearlessly to defend the interests of all our clients.”Pavlov retained the services of GPW, a business intelligence company run by a former MI6 officer, Andrew Fulton. Browder says GPW’s brief included gathering intelligence on him. Fulton – a chairman of the Scottish Conservative party – left GPW in 2017. Its managing director, Philip Worman, said he could not comment on “any aspect of our work”.Fulton’s former GPW colleague Andrew Wordsworth said Pavlov was entitled to know the facts of his case: “The use of sanctions against iniduals is a pretty draconian remedy. Some people would argue that before you destroy people’s lives they should be able to defend themselves.”In his evidence Browder alleges that Pavlov also hired Lynton Crosby’s communications firm CTF, paying it £45,000.However, CTF denies Browder’s allegations. It says Goldsmith’s law firm hired a separate entity, CTF Corporate \u0026amp Financial Communications (CTFCFC), to “research the EU sanctions landscape”. CTFCFC advised the law firm and there was no contact with Pavlov. “This was the extent of our involvement and to try and claim otherwise would be utterly false,” it said. According to Companies House records, Crosby is a CTFCFC director.There is no suggestion Crosby personally worked on or was aware of the work on EU sanctions carried out by CTFCFC until it appeared in the media. “Lynton Crosby was working exclusively on the 2015 general election campaign for the Conservative party at this time, and had no client involvement, outside of the Conservative party,” it said, adding that Crosby had never met or worked with Goldsmith or Debevoise.Browder further names British iniduals who have fronted up offshore companies used in the alleged Magnitsky fraud and in other cases. The UK citizens appear as nominal directors of non-transparent firms in countries through which billions of dollars have been laundered, including the UK, Russia, Ukraine, Cyprus and Latvia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f12b36ea9c728947d3513439f313d52b0a5c3a/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e1906e8a45a6e83067fb902e5bb299b","title":"shopping travel events what coronavirus means for consumers","story":"Where do those who have booked tickets stand? And should you stockpile groceries?That depends. If you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an official seller, you are entitled to a refund, often automatically. For example, those who bought tour packages to go to the Italy v England Six Nations rugby match in Rome on 14 March – which has been postponed – will be offered a full refund or tickets for the new date.But Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, added: “Unfortunately, it will be harder to get a refund on any travel or accommodation booked for the match, unless these were purchased as part of a package deal.”Keep a close eye on venue and ticket agency websites, especially before you set off – most are providing regular updates. If you opt not to go, there are a number of fan-to-fan resale websites, including Twickets, where you can sell your tickets and hopefully recoup your outlay.Also bear in mind that if you have purchased a ticket through a resale website, refunds will depend on the site’s (typically restrictive) terms and conditions.This is a tricky area and you may be fighting your case with large numbers of other people, but as a last resort you could turn to your credit or debit card provider to seek a section 75 claim or chargeback.Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, your credit card company is jointly and severally liable for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the retailer or trader. This right is useful if the retailer or trader has gone bust, or doesn’t respond to your pressure, although the transaction must be for a sum over £100. Similarly, if you paid by debit card, then you can seek a debit card chargeback. You can’t apply for either if you paid by Bacs or direct bank transfer, however.The British Retail Consortium says shops have so far seen no effect on the numbers of customers entering stores. But at the same time, demand for home deliveries appears to be soaring. Last week, the delivery giant Ocado advised customers to place their orders early, due to “exceptionally high demand”.The government has told supermarkets to ensure they make provision for home delivery to vulnerable people in self-isolation, given that the government is advising people who have returned from badly affected coronavirus areas to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. There could be disruption further down the line if illness affects delivery drivers and other staff, but retailers have pledged to manage this as best they can.Foreign Office advice on the situation in Italy is regularly updating, but the travel trade association Abta warned on Monday that UK holidaymakers who had booked summer trips to the country faced losing money if they wanted to cancel now because of the coronavirus. It said people who had paid for package holidays not due to begin in the next few days would need to wait to see if the situation changed. While trips beginning immediately should be covered, Abta said it was too early to say that summer holidays could not go ahead as planned. “If you cancel early you may have to pay cancellation charges,” it added.The government’s outbound guidance could be crucial for many trips – not least because airlines may cancel flights, or at the least travel insurance could be invalidated. When the government advises against all but essential travel, that means airlines and bonded holiday firms are usually obliged to refund bookings to that destination.The key page for British citizens is the Foreign Office travel advice page for Australians, the Smart Traveller site and for the US, the State Department page. Abta also provides further advice for holidaymakers.Flights to short-haul European destinations are always cheap this time of year – the kind of fares seen on budget carriers to coronavirus-hit Italy aren’t noticeably different from elsewhere.Airlines have also cut capacity to match supply to tumbling demand, meaning that flights may not yet see rock-bottom prices – even if a lot of paying passengers continue to decide not to turn up. The real test will be whether Easter and summer fares tumble too. Transport authorities are following Public Health England advice and have said that they do not expect to see public transport closed, and that the risk of contagion is no greater on trains or buses than in any public space. The bigger threat to services for which Transport for London and others are planning is any outbreak among crucial employees who are unable to self-isolate or work from home – not least drivers, crew and other frontline staff.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport held a much trailed meeting with sporting bodies and broadcasters on Monday. It doesn’t seem to have changed much. “Based upon the current scientific advice from the government’s medical experts, there is no rationale to close or cancel sporting events as things stand,” a spokesperson for the department said.That means the Cheltenham festival goes ahead this week and Premier League matches will be played in front of paying crowds. The Six Nations rugby fixture between Wales and Scotland will also take place, in contrast to France against Ireland and Italy against England, which have been postponed.Almost certainly. It appears government is reluctant to cancel events unless necessary, perhaps understandable given the amount of interest and revenue attached to UK sport. The UK’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has also downplayed the value in shutting down large gatherings. But while countries across the world are either cancelling events or playing them behind closed doors, and with the spread of the virus expected to accelerate, pressure will mount on UK bodies to soon follow suit.All eyes here are on the Premier League. The UK’s most popular competition is determined to keep the show on the road, but increasingly those within football expect some matches to be driven behind closed doors. If that happens, there have been widely reported suggestions that every match would then be shown on TV, breaking a decades-old understanding that Saturday 3pm matches could not be broadcast live. it is understood that those games would only be available on pay-TV, however, through partners Sky and BT Sport. You would need a subscription to watch.This was one rather unexpected line that was briefed ahead of the meeting, with Crystal Palace’s 72-year-old manager, Roy Hodgson, subsequently wondering what it might mean for him. In the official summary of Monday’s meeting, however, the proposal was not mentioned.Britain’s leading theatres are remaining open for now. The National Theatre and Leeds Playhouse are both going ahead with shows as planned, for example, while the Society of London Theatres – which represents the West End – said: “Official advice states that there is currently no clear rationale to cancel events.”Glastonbury festival currently says it “continues to plan and prepare” for the event scheduled for 24-28 June. The Association of Independent Festivals, representing 50 UK events including Victorious, Boomtown, Field Day and Liverpool Sound City, said “there is no rationale” to cancel events yet. Its chief executive, Paul Reed, added: “We appreciate that public health advice can change from hour to hour. Our members will adapt accordingly.”Meanwhile, organisers of the Cannes film festival – scheduled to begin in two months – say they are still working as normal even though public gatherings of more than 1,000 are banned in France indefinitely. The SXSW festival was cancelled on Saturday.Ticket holders will be entitled to refunds if events are cancelled, though these payouts could seriously harm festivals without insurance cover for communicable disease. Michael Rawlings, underwriting manager at Event Insurance Services, told the  that “very few people would have had the foresight” to add on the specialist cover."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4197953.1583789640!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"petrol stations taking inordinate amount of time to lower prices says consumer group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish petrol stations are taking an “inordinate” amount of time to lower their petrol and diesel prices to reflect the latest crash in crude oil prices, the Consumers Association of Ireland has said.   Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Irish petrol stations are taking an “inordinate” amount of time to lower their petrol and diesel prices to reflect the latest crash in crude oil prices, the Consumers Association of Ireland has said.Oil prices fell by 30 per cent on Monday following a stand-off between Saudi Arabia and Russia and leading to a slump in global stock market shares and triggering fears of a global recession. Prices tumbled after Saudi Arabia launched an oil price war with Russia by slashing its official selling price and outlining plans for an increase in crude production next month.Data released by AA Ireland shows pump prices dropped slightly in February, from 144.5 cents to 141.9 cents for petrol and from 135.9 cents to 133.5 cents for diesel.A spokeswoman for the Irish Petroleum Industry Association said it was “unrealistic” to assume the price an Irish motorist pays at the pump would change automatically due to a drop in crude oil prices. Crude oil accounts for less than a quarter of the cost of diesel and petrol, while taxes, levies and excise make up the majority of liquid fuel costs, she said.Dermott Jewell of the Consumers’ Association of Ireland, argued that Irish consumers were fed up with “history repeating itself” regarding the high cost of fuel.“It’s like deja vu. Across the years Irish consumers and businesses have experienced this dilemma whereby there is an inordinate period of delay before prices at the pumps reflect significant drops in the basic prices of crude products”.He acknowledged the high taxation of petrol but noted that Ireland’s “exorbitantly high level of tax” on fuel should also be reduced to make petrol more affordable for Irish consumers.‘Substantive reduction’Conor Faughnan, AA director of consumer affairs, said he expected to see a “substantive reduction in fuel prices” in the coming weeks but said the delay between crude oil prices dropping and price cuts at the petrol pumps was normal.“You sometimes do get a shock to oil prices but you have to wait to see if it’s sustained. But in a case like this, there has already been a significant fall in the last month so I would confidently expect to see a reduction in our fuel prices.”Mr Faughnan also noted that consumers underestimate the high tax on fuel which currently makes up around 65 per cent of retail prices. “People want to see the same drop in petrol that they see in oil prices but tax is charged by the litre, it doesn’t fluctuate with price.”In a statement, Maxol group said crude oil prices had continued to drop at an “unprecedented rate” since February but warned of a “significant lag” before prices fall at the pump.Maxol said it was already reducing pump prices and would continue to monitor the situation on a daily basis.A spokeswoman for Circle K said the company had recently seen pump prices across the network decrease at an average 3.5 cent per litre. She also underlined the high taxation, Vat rates and “obligatory costs” on fuel prices in Ireland, noting that these elements “do not change with market movements”.“The eventual product retailed by Circle K is calculated based on the cost of refined product at time of purchase, therefore, when crude oil prices fall this is not immediately reflected in market prices across our network of service stations.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Identity of artists to be hidden in charity auction of over 2,000 original worksNew \u0026euro2.6bn sick pay measures and business liquidity fund announced Global stocks markets plungeCoalition between FF, FG, Greens, some Independents seen as most likely way forwardPetrol groups warn of a \u0026lsquosignificant lag\u0026rsquo before pump prices reflect crude oil price dropSuccessful applicants will be awarded State contracts to generate power for national gridProhibition order served on Glasnevin business over crates of \u0026ldquounidentified raw meatWarning of possible difficulties claiming from airlines or accommodation providersTesco in UK starts to ration key products as fighting over toilet roll emerges in AustraliaUndertakers\u0026rsquo group issues guidelines urging delay of services and restrictions on contactSt Patrick\u0026rsquos Day parades across the State to be cancelledNew income support plan will cost \u0026euro2.4bn, with payments available to self-employedThe hospital in Rathgar treats cancer patientsTwo men arrested after significant seizure of nearly 22kgs of cocaineDublin organisers welcome move as being in the \u0026lsquobest interests of public health\u0026rsquoStaff asked to compoy with measure after non-KPMG employee had \u0026lsquoclose contact\u0026rsquo with Covid-19 patientBreach occurred in relation to part of a Dublin city office buildingMedical Council says missing ongoing training may be excusable due to virus fearsDrinking water and swimming pools rendered safe by appropriate levels of chlorineBank of Ireland charged woman more than twice what she ought to be paying on her mortgage, court toldMan fails to provide necessary documents for a valid application for residence, judge findsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4197896.1583784781!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish shops see surge in sale of canned food pasta and cleaning products","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTesco worker Marie Downey stocks the shelves with disinfectant wipes in Stillorgan, Co Dublin. Photograph: Tom Honan for The In countries as far apart as Japan, Australia and the US there have been reports of panicked shoppers stocking up on everything from long-life milk to noodles, while videos of people fighting in supermarket aisles over toilet paper inAustralia have gone viral as coronavirus spreads with frightening speed across the world.Large retail chains in the UK, including Tesco, have started rolling out a rationing system for key products and shoppers are not being allowed buy more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables.Pictures of empty shelves are circulating widely on social media.While there has been no formal rationing in Ireland, this country has not been immune to the panic buying and there has been a noticeable surge in the sale of canned goods, pasta and cleaning products in supermarkets here.Items deemed to be essential in the current climate, including hand sanitiser and face masks have largely disappeared from shelves while wholesalers are reporting sales level for groceries normally not seen outside of the peak shopping period before Christmas.‘Not going to starve’But, as yet, the panic seen elsewhere and evident in the Republic when snow brought the country to a virtual standstill two years ago during what became known as the Beast from the East has yet to materialise.Retailers and retail analysts and Government ministers have all been anxious to keep it that way and to stress that there is no need for panic as supply lines remain solid.“People are looking at how fragile supply seemed to be during the snow of two years ago but the reason food shortages became such a big issue then was because transport and distribution were very badly affected,” said retail expert and TU Dublin academic Damien O’Reilly.“That should not happen now unless we have huge numbers of people who are self-isolating. There should not be a problem with supplies of bread, milk, eggs and meat because those things are produced in Ireland. And it is important to stress that we produce enough of what we need here and we’re not going to starve.”Mr O’Reilly added that work done by retail chains to streamline and improve their supply lines ahead of Britain potentially crashing out of the EU last year will prove to be of benefit in the weeks ahead.But despite his reassurances, many continue to stock-pile with logic rarely coming into their purchasing decisions.“Consumers compensate for a perceived loss of control by buying products designed to fill a basic need, solve a problem or accomplish a task,” wrote Andy J Yap, an assistant professor of organisational behaviour at business school INSEAD in the Conversation online magazine yesterday.“This is what we’re seeing as people rush to buy rice, cleaning products and paper goods in illogically large proportions.He added that in times of crisis, “people don’t want a huge debate, they want action. To assuage people’s anxiety and help them regain a feeling of control, it is up to governments to signal that they have a game plan in mind and are taking timely steps to address the problem.”The Government tried that late last week.Sturdy linesAfter a high-level meeting between her department and representatives of the grocery sector to discuss contingency plans for food supplies, the Minister for Enterprise Heather Humphries said she had been “greatly encouraged” by preparations.She said she had been “assured that grocery supply chains are well-stocked and there is ample supply to meet demand”.Retailers – at least those who have responded to queries from this newspaper – have also stressed their supply lines are sturdy enough to withstand shocks related to the spread of Covid-19.In 2019 academics from Trinity College and Dublin City University published research in the Journal of Marketing Management looking at a cohort of people who don’t believe such assurances – preppers.The paper pointed to a rise in the number of people readying themselves for existential threats by stocking up on food, fuel and securing their own water and power supplies.Dr Gary Sinclair of DCU was one of the authors of the report and told The  that people not normally given to anticipating the breakdown of civilisation would still move swiftly to stockpile key items if they saw that things were running short.“I think you only need to look at what happened during the snow two years ago to see how Irish people react in a crisis and to see how fragile supply lines can be. We had all these people panic-buying bread even though it made absolutely no sense. And you have the riots in Australia over toilet paper. It shows how irrational people can become and that is understandable because people are frightened.”Mr O’Reilly played down such fears and said that while people could expect to see changes in their supermarkets in the days and weeks ahead, food would not run out.“I think we will see retailers asking manufacturers to make just one size of a particular product and choice will go down for a period,” he said. “But we are not heading into Mad Max territory, definitely not.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4197958.1583789892!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin and varadkar to meet on tuesday for government formation talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoth party leaders  released a joint statement on Monday night  saying they discussed a ‘variety of policy issues’.

He also said all public gatherings will be banned.“The right decision today is to stay at home. Our future and the future of Italy is in our hands. These hands have to be more responsible today than ever before,” Mr Conte said.Italy’s 60-million people will only be able to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies until April 3rd. All schools and universities, which were closed nationwide last week until March 15th, will now not reopen before next month. The contagion only came to light near Italy’s financial capital Milan on February 21st. Since then there have been some 9,172 confirmed cases and 463 deaths, putting the national health system under massive strain.Mr Conte said any public gatherings, including in the open air, would be forbidden and announced that all sports events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, would be suspended. Mr Conte said public transport will remain operationalMr Conte said a new government decree will require all people in Italy to demonstrate a need to work, health conditions or other limited reasons to travel outside the areas where they live. “There won’t be just a red zone,” he told reporters, referring to a lockdown of areas in northern Italy instituted over the weekend. “There will be Italy” as a protected area, he said.Mr Conte told reporters that measures introduced just two days ago in much of the north were no longer sufficient and that they would have to be extended to the whole country from Tuesday.Italy on Monday reported 463 deaths from the virus an increase of 97 from Sunday.The extension comes after the government imposed a virtual lockdown at the weekend on the northern region of Lombardy and parts of neighbouring Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna to try to slow the spread of the virus.Deputy economy minister Antonio Misiani said the government might also consider a moratorium on companies’ payments of tax and welfare contributions.Rome has already said it will pay self-employed workers in the areas worst hit by the virus €500 a month for the next three months to help make up for lost income.Meanwhile the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday, coronavirus , also known as Covid-19, is closer to causing a pandemic but outbreaks in countries can still be controlled through a combination of containment and mitigation measures.“Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, told a news conference. “But it would be the first pandemic that could be controlled. The bottom line is we are not at the mercy of the virus.”European Union leaders will hold emergency talks soon to discuss a joint response to\u0026nbspcoronavirus, officials said on Monday, as the bloc’s executive considers relaxing state subsidy rules to allow extra public spending.Ms Von der Leyen said the EU could also spend some of its own money to combat the crisis, but admitted resources were scarce.The EU parliament on Monday shortened its monthly four-day plenary sitting to only one-and-half days.The EU council, which hosts meetings of national diplomats and ministers, last week sent home more than 50 people after two infections among its staff.A first case was also detected at the EU Commission, a spokeswoman for the body said on Monday.A Nato spokeswoman said on Monday the military alliance had sent home some staff after one official working at the Brussels headquarters had tested positive.IsraelIsrael will require all citizens who return from abroad to self-quarantine for 14 days as a precaution, a measure aides said would go into force immediately.Israel had already taken some of the most extreme precautions to prevent a local coronavirus outbreak, forcing visitors from many countries in Asia and Europe into home isolation.

Photograph: Antonio CalanniAP PhotoThe European Union’s disease prevention agency is set to tighten its advice on coronavirus as evidence emerges that people showing no symptoms can spread the virus.Until Monday the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) had advised that “people who are infected but who do not show symptoms cannot transmit the virus”, a belief that has influenced policy and quarantine decisions in several EU countries as cases balloon.This was in conflict with advice from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The WHO states that, while rare, “there are people who can shed Covid-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset”.Chinese researchers reported a case of asymptomatic transmission on February 21st, and German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn they had identified a case of transmission by a person without symptoms near Munich.Asked by The  why it advised that the virus could not be transmitted without symptoms, the ECDC responded that it “will be updating the information on our webpage within the coming days”.A spokeswoman confirmed this was an update of advice on asymptomatic transmission, declining to give further details.It comes as cases of the disease have boomed around Europe and Italy announced a national lockdown to try to prevent the virus from spreading, encouraging all citizens to stay at home if they can and avoid social contacts.Citizens who must venture out are advised to keep a distance of one metre from other people.The death toll in Italy spiked by 97 to 463 on Monday, as overall cases in the hardest-hit EU country topped 9,000.In France, culture minister Franck Riester tested positive for the virus, and gatherings of more than 1,000 people have been banned as cases rose to 1,412 with 25 deaths. The chief executive of France’s busiest airports Paris Charles de Gaulle and Orly, Augustin de Romanet, also tested positive.In Spain, schools and universities in the Madrid region and schools in the capital of the Basque region Vitoria are to close for two weeks as a precaution as the infection spread further there. Official figures show 28 people have died in Spain from the virus, and there are a total of 1,204 cases.Israel has announced it will require anyone arriving from overseas to self-quarantine for 14 days as a precaution, as the number of cases reached 43 there. Non-Israelis seeking to enter the country will have to prove they have the means to self-quarantine, and the measure could affect 300,000 citizens in a country of about nine million according to local media.‘Example’Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa announced from his balcony that he would observe voluntary quarantine for two weeks despite testing negative for coronavirus, as an “example” to Portuguese people.“I’m going to keep working from home,” he yelled to media below, as cases reached 35 in the country.

The Scottish government official, who cannot be named for legal reasons and gave evidence from behind a screen, claimed the former SNP leader sexually assaulted her on two separate occasions in 2014, the first allegedly in May.On that occasion, she told the court how Mr Salmond asked her to take shots of a drink which had been given to him by the Chinese ambassador.She told how she desperately tried to resist his advances on two occasions – but he was a “big guy” who at one point leaned over her with his stomach “pressing” into her.Sometimes he appeared “titillated”, on another occasion he was “ogling” her, leaving her “scared” and at worst “panicking”. “He was putting his hand down my top and kissing my neck, touching my legs,” she told the court, as Alex Prentice QC, the prosecutor, questioned her. “He just groped me, I don’t have another word for it.“I froze inside, I verbally communicated that I wasn’t happy, I said ‘what are you doing, you shouldn’t be doing this’, and he found it funny.”The second incident is alleged to have happened a few weeks later in June after Mr Salmond hosted a private fundraising dinner for the independence referendum campaign.The court heard that Mr Salmond made an inappropriate advance towards the woman and started touching her legs, kissing her and running his hands over her body. “I was talking to him the whole time, trying to explain why this wasn’t OK,” she said.“I just wanted to get away and tried to get away. I told him to stop, I just wasn’t getting through, he was just trying to make banter out of it.“At this point, I started to feel scared. I can only really describe the next set of events as feeling you were in the ring, like Muhammad Ali and Foreman.”The court heard that Mr Salmond kept asking her to stay overnight and she agreed but on the condition they stayed in separate rooms, a concession that she described as being “a bit of an escape plan”.The woman told the jury that she then managed to make her way into another room, but Mr Salmond followed her in with a bottle of wine.“He wanted me to have a drink with him and wanted to talk. I think I thought for a moment that he was sorry and that he realised he had gone too far,” she said. At this point, Mr Salmond “pounced” and tried to block the woman from leaving the “Connery room” – so-called after Sean Connery stayed there in 2007 – before taking her clothes off, pushing her back on to the bed and lying on top of her naked.“He was physically all over me, kissing me, he was taking my clothes off – it all happened really quickly,” she said, her voice sometimes breaking.As she tried to leave, Mr Salmond became more “assertive” and tried to stop her. “It was constant, it wouldn’t stop,” she said. “He was there on top of me, I was at the time trying to push myself to the back of the bed. He just laid over me. I kept saying to him ‘what are you doing, stop’ and he didn’t. I felt like I was being hunted.”The woman said she remembers feeling an “aroused” Mr Salmond lying on her with “his private parts on top of me”. After numerous attempts, the woman managed to successfully push him away, the court heard.“I just did one final push to get him away and managed to get him on the other side of the bed. He kept saying to me he will be a great lover,” she said.“I think he was a bit drunk – he could be quite or a lot drunk, it was hard to know. He was muttering how I was being stupid and then he passed out and started snoring.”She told the jury that she escaped to a nearby bathroom where she locked herself in. “I curled into a ball in the fetal position thinking just be really quiet or he will hear you,” she said, suggesting she may have been in there for a couple of hours. “I was scared. I was in shock for a long time afterwards. I felt humiliated and embarrassed.”The woman said she felt she should have called for help, explaining: “I wish in hindsight I had just screamed or kicked him in the nuts, but I was so frozen and just panicking inside.”She told the court she did not give him any indication that she would welcome any contact from Mr Salmond.“I didn’t want any of it to happen. Why would I want to go out with him? He is a much older man who does not look after himself.”Gordon Jackson QC, Mr Salmond’s lawyer, lodged a special defence of alibi for the alleged incident in May 2014, saying he was not in Bute House during the majority of the month.The defence was lodged for three alleged sexual assaults and one alleged indecent assault. The full charges  a period between June 29 2008 and November 11 2014, with one sexual assault said to have taken place in the month of the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014.Mr Salmond – who was first minister from 2007 to 2014 – faces a number of other sexual assault charges, as well as two indecent assault charges. His trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus has united nation divided brexit meghan","story":"Can you get enough of talking about coronavirus?

Long conversations about handwashing feel not only soothing and faintly patriotic, but also like a safe subject.Things also still, despite the empty shelves and Cobra meetings, feel hypothetical. All those hysterics trying to literally insulate themselves against catastrophe using mountains of bulk-bought bog roll are – at the moment – merely funny.I don\u0027t want to be blasé about the threat facing the older generation (I have parents in their 80s, both with the dreaded underlying health conditions). If this was a virus that was carrying off the under-10s in great numbers we might all genuinely be more scared, as opposed to now when we mostly feel a bit silly. But for now, coronavirus is a badly-needed social glue, allowing us to communicate again and make jokes without fear that we\u0027ve said the wrong thing. It feels to me, in spirit, a little like the Christmas Day truce in 1914. Just for a precious moment, we\u0027ve put down our guns and we\u0027re all on the same side.Long may that spirit (if not the coronavirus) last.    The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Or are companies in for disappointment?Hundreds of flights have been cancelled, major sporting events called off.Business has dried up entirely for some unfortunate firms.The economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak has already been significant.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it’s likely to get worse.There’s speculation the Tokyo Olympics this summer might need to be postponed – a festival on which the Japanese government has already spent some $25bn (£19bn).But that’s why businesses and iniduals take out insurance isn’t it? To cover themselves for when unexpected and hugely damaging shocks like disease outbreaks hit?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe UK government this week, under pressure from industry lobby groups, designated\u0026nbspCovid-19 a “notifiable disease”, in order to make it easier for affected companies to claim insurance.So can we expect an avalanche of claims and big losses for insurance companies as a result of this outbreak?Or are companies in for disappointment if they expect to be compensated for the economic damage wreaked by Covid-19?It’s worth drawing a distinction between two broad categories of business insurance, say experts.First, there’s event cancellation insurance, which is a type generally offered by sophisticated insurance markets like Lloyd’s of London or major insurance conglomerates.Torsten Jeworrek of the German insurer Munich Re\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspReuters\u0026nbsplast month that his firm had provided cancellation insurance for the Tokyo games “in the hundreds of millions of euros”.Second, there’s the more general cover for “business interruption” offered to companies by smaller insurance firms.But if a firm is covered it’s covered, isn’t it?Not necessarily. It all depends on the wording of the inidual insurance contract.But it’s important to bear a broad principle in mind, namely that there’s a difference from the perspective of the insurance company between “definable” and “undefinable” risk.And insurance firms are unlikely to have written an insurance policy that covers a firm from the impact of an undefinable risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Think of a hotel that sees its bookings slump because people change their travel plans. Or a company that suffers because it’s staff don’t turn up to work because of illness.Would cutting rates really help the economy deal with coronavirus?In any case, industry experts caution that “notifiable disease” clauses (the classification the UK government updated this week) are not standard in insurance contracts.“Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks, not those that are very unlikely, such as the effects of Covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers.So what’s the bottom line: are insurers going to be hit hard or not?Crawford Forensic Accounting Services produced a report last month on the likely impact of coronavirus on the insurance sector.It concluded that “successful claims under business interruption coverage for infection are not common”.Crawford director Frederique Hardy also told The Independent that event cancellation insurance contracts tend to be very bespoke, making it difficult to generalise about the ability of event organisers to make claim.Yet the general view of the industry – at the moment – is that coronavirus is unlikely to result in an explosion of costly payouts.If that’s correct it points to a lot of disappointed firms.And, as a by product, it’s likely to increase further the pressure on governments to give stressed companies economic relief in the form of more time to pay tax and perhaps forbearance on debt repayments to banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 2.4 per cent by 0856 GMT.Germany’s DAX slid 2.4 per cent, Britain‘s FTSE 100 fell 1.8 per cent and France‘s CAC 40 fell 2.4 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.72 per cent.After marking their worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, global stocks as measured by the index are up 1.7 per cent this week, as sentiment recovered on the back of stimulus from policymakers to combat the economic fallout of the virus.The US Federal Reserve made an emergency interest rate cut of 50 basis points earlier this week. The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates, with investors expecting other major central banks to soon follow suit.Officials and companies in Britain, France, Italy and the United States are struggling to deal with a steady rise in virus infections that have in some cases triggered corporate defaults, office evacuations, and panic buying of daily necessities.The outbreak spread across the United States on Thursday, surfacing in at least four new states.“The interplay of virus containment fears and stimulus measures means that in the near term we expect market volatility to persist,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Yields on US Treasuries fell to a record low and Treasury futures jumped as investors increased bets that the Fed will follow this week’s surprise rate cut with further easing.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record low of 0.7650 per cent on Friday.Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari said late on Thursday the Fed could cut rates further if needed.Money markets are pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has claimed more than 3,000 lives, and though new infections have slowed in China there are concerns other countries are not prepared.Covid-19 vaccines won’t be ready until next year, drugmakers predictTrump slams Democrats over coronavirus, claims he is not blaming ObamaTravel restrictions and factory closures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus are expected to pressure global growth.Many investors were awaiting the release of US non-farm payrolls later on Friday. Recent US economic data has been encouraging, but concerns about the epidemic are likely to overshadow any signs of a strong labour market.Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2.1 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index sank 2.94 per cent. Australian shares were down 2.44 per cent.Shares in China fell 1.22 per cent, while stocks in Hong Kong, another city hard hit by the virus, fell 2.12 per cent.Against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell to a six-month low and was last at 105.77 yen.

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown. It has cancelled most of its public events over the next month but said its rate-setting Governing Council meeting would go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The turmoil in global markets on Monday was deepened by\u0026nbspan all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which has led to stocks and oil prices tanking around the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown. It has cancelled most of its public events over the next month but said its rate-setting Governing Council meeting would go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The turmoil in global markets on Monday was deepened by\u0026nbspan all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which has led to stocks and oil prices tanking around the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Countries not on the visa-exempt list already have to obtain a full visa which costs significantly more.Brexit trade talks kick off in Brussels with plenty of hand sanitiserAn\u0026nbspEU commission spokesperson confirmed to The Independent that the current planning for Etias implementation is it will apply as of end 2022.The UK\u0027s final relationship with the EU will be settled by trade talks which are currently taking place, but the UK government has ruled out keeping free movement which means Britain is almost certain to be included in the Etias system.Under the new system passengers will have to complete an online application form that covers questions ranging from security to personal data. The application is expected to be processed within 96 hours, with passengers\u0027 names cross-checked against police databases, and the results sent by email.The system is not technically a travel visa under EU law, though it has many of the characteristics of one. A single authorisation will be valid for three years or when a person\u0027s passport expires, whichever is sooner.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A migrant man runs away as another one takes cover behind a bin as Greek police use water cannons to block them trying to break fences in the Turkey-Greece border province of EdirnePolice and forensic experts inspect the scene of an explosion near the US embassy in Tunis, the capital of TunisiaMigrants prepare for the coming night in a forest in the buffer zone at the Turkey-Greece border a crossing pointA migrant rests with a child in his arms next to the Tunca river in Edirne, TurkeySpanish policemen and civil guards sporting Guy Fawkes masks protest in front of Spanish policemen standing guard during a demonstration to demand fair wages in MadridSouth Korean soldiers wearing protective gear spray disinfectant as part of preventive measures against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, at a market in DaeguA woman shouts as law enforcement officials move in to disperse a group of immigrants who had occupied a historic church and a square.

The level of uncertainty means it is unwise for it to attempt to settle the big questions on tax, spending and borrowing.One influential Tory source tells me that: “You can’t do spectacular, interesting stuff during corona. But you can do boring and dficult things.”The Budget will concentrate on delivering the Tories’ election promises. Inside the Treasury it has been dubbed the “Manesto Budget”.It will contain changes to ensure that more infrastructure projects are built outside London and the South East, there will be a “Union connectivity” project launched to better link up England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — expect Boris’s bridge to get a mention — it will green-light a slew of road projects, provide money for fast broadband and increase funding for research.It will also curb the entrepreneurs’ tax relief that has turned from being an encouragement to take a risk on a new business to a general form of tax relief for wealthy investors.The Budget will also seek to emphasise that, despite the undoubted, short-term disruption the coronavirus will cause, the medium-term future for the economy is pretty rosy.Unlike with the  financial crash, the economy will rebound strongly once the virus has passed.There is, though, a big debate going on in government about how much the Government should do to help iniduals and businesses through the corona downturn.The rise in the number of people in the UK who are their own boss means there are more than four million workers not entitled to sick pay.The Government will, almost certainly, offer these people more time to pay their taxes. But what more it should do is the subject of growing debate in Whitehall.One of those involved in these discussions points out: “We can’t pay for the whole gig economy for the next six months.”A minister argues that people can get an advance from universal credit within two days in urgent cases. They fear thatthe Government starts paying the wages of the self-employed, then it will be hard to see where it should stop.They point out that a plumber who earns £, a week now, will almost certainly lose money as the virus spreads. Should the State make that up Coronavirus will change the way we live over the next few months, at the very least.But the challenge for the Government is to ensure that work on everything  doesn’t cease while the country tries to fight this crisis.It still has a job of work to do to get the country ready for le outside the EU and to prepare the economy for the great changes that technology is about to bring.BORIS JOHNSON is determined to defend Priti Patel, his Home Secretary, who is facing ious allegations of bullying from civil servants.Internally, he has given short shrt to those who have suggested he distance himself from her.There is a view in Downing Street that several of the most dramatic charges against her don’t stack up.They also claim that these concerns about Patel’s behaviour were not expressed as official complaints at the time.They, “didn’t reach up at a formal level”, I’m told.No knows, though, that it has a fight on its hands to save Patel.One source tells me: “Yes, she can survive. But there’s no smoke without fire. It is shaping up to be quite a big struggle.”Part of the issue is that there is a view among senior civil servants that, given that the top civil servant at the Home Office has quit because of this row, Patel should go too.But Downing Street know thatPatel goes, it would become harder to push reform through the system.One of those at the heart of government tells me: “You can’t have a situation where civil servants get to determine who their Secretary of State is.”The next hurdle for Patel to clear is Sir Alex Allan’s inquiry into whether her behaviour breached the ministerial code.There is a quiet confidence among her allies that while she will receive some criticism from his report, she won’t be found guilty of breaching the code.Buther former Permanent Secretary Sir Philip Rutnam really is determined to take his case to an employment tribunal, then the situation will become far more dficult for the Home Secretary.THERE’S a new political ide: Do you still shake hands or have you started bumping elbows to try to reduce your risk of contacting coronavirus Boris Johnson is still very much a hand-shaker, as is the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.But some other Cabinet ministers have taken to either nodding politely or bumping elbows.As one of those close to the talks put it: “We’ve told them what we think. Their illusions are disappearing rapidly.”The question now is whether when the EU negotiators turn up in London in less than two weeks’ time, they come with a dferent approach or carry on pushing these ideas.THE local elections in May might have to be postponed because of coronavirus.If the UK’s response to the outbreak is still in the delay phase, continuing with the contests would go against that advice, as it would bring large numbers of people into contact with each other.I understand this option is being discussed in Whitehall, but no decision has been taken.But as one figure in government points out: “We postponed a General Election once because of an epidemic.”The  General Election was pushed back to June from May because of foot-and-mouth disease.Delaying the elections – which will see mayors elected in London, the West Midlands and Manchester among other races – would be a big step, and one the Government would only take with the utmost reluctance.The next few weeks will tell us whether it is necessary or not.- James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only the old, frail and sick, they believe, will die. So there is no need to worry.Let’s park, for now, the fact the virus has already mutated into something more aggressive, which might put more people at risk.We need to listen to the experts not for our own sakes but precisely for those old, frail and sick people in and around our lives.That may mean putting other ­people’s needs before our own. Sadly, that does not come ­naturally to everyone. This is the same mindset that sets some people off bulk-buying food andloo roll.Bulk-buying is the epitome of selfishness — quite the opposite of the spirit that united us during World War Two, when people knew they really were in it together.Stockpiling food takes it away from someone who might need it more. I have faith in the public. And I urge everyone to look at what is happening as an invitation — a challenge to rise to — to work out ways in which we can look after each other a little bit ­better.If you know someone old, frail or sick, find ways to make sure they are OK, rather than thinking: “I’m all right, Jack.”As the coronavirus outbreak ­worsens, Britain’s older generation are expected to be warned to self-isolate and stay at home. So it’s up to all of us to do our bit and visit them now — before social distancing is introduced.Coping with loneliness and isolation is already hard enough for many, so let’s do all we can to show them we care. Meanwhile, follow the advice from Public Health England and protect yourself from getting sick as a way of protecting others.Focus on being a good member of your community, on helping others and being a good neighbour. In that way, perhaps, something positive might yet emerge from a very worrying situation.A recent study found our sense of community spirit is declining, with more than half of those polled admitting they barely say a word to their neighbours and do not feel part of a “good neighbourly community”. Just one in ten volunteers with local groups or charities.What happened to us  How did we become so selfish  This “me, me, me” approach is too prevalent. The cult of the inidual approach has led us to think: “As long as my own nest is feathered, I needn’t care about anyone .”If we want something good to come from all this, let’s pause for thought, change our outlook and start thinking of others before we think of ourselves.A crisis can bring out the best — or the worst — in us. We should work to prioritise kindness and bring out the best in each other. The opposite ups the chances of a crisis becoming a catastrophe.I LOVE the fact Heidi Klum, , is so evidently over the moon about being married to musician Tom Kaulitz,  . . . and he is just as happy.In snaps of the pair having dinner in West Hollywood on Wednesday night, she is beaming with pride.Never mind the -year age gap. They both seem to be having a thoroughly nice time together.THERE is no doubt Megxit has put more pressure on William and Kate to meet the public’s expectations and live their lives in the spotlight.While it’s a huge shame Harry and Meghan felt they had no choice but to leave the country, the Cambridges are stepping up to the plate.On their three-day tour of Ireland they have met hundreds of people and posed for countless selfies during an exhausting itinerary.They have visited mental health charities, met farmers and poured oil on potentially troubled waters by speaking at a reception in Dublin about the “many wrongs” Ireland has suffered and our “complex” shared history.They tried their hand at everything from pulling pints to juggling, all the time with smiles on their faces.Some people think that it must be easy being a royal but I defy anyone to do as much as they do in a day, making people feel at ease in their company and all without grumbling.They make a good team and seem genuinely happy to share their lives with us. They will make a great king and queen.SOBERING findings from the United Nations should give us all pause for thought on International Women’s Day.Nine in ten people around the globe are prejudiced against women, it found.That includes depressing notions such as a university education being more important for men than for women and that blokes are more deserving of the jobswork is scarce.Half of the world’s men AND WOMEN feel that fellas make better political leaders, while more than  per cent feel men make better business executives.It is not wholly surprising, I guess,chaps think that way. But these numbers reflect how a horrying number of women think this way too.I guess this is in part due to the received ideas that have formed the backbone of our culture for far too long. That is something for us all to reflect on and challenge wherever we can from now on.ANY woman over  who feels inadequate looking at the drop-dead gorgeousness of Elizabeth Hurley, , can stop the comparisons.It turns out Liz is human after all. Talking to her old friend Trinny Woodall, Liz revealed that she sleeps in a bra every night to keep her cleavage “high and firm” and keeps gaffer tape in her handbag.Gaffer tape, she says, is the secret to her impressive cleavage when she wears plunging dresses.“I wouldn’t be without it,” she said. “I’m obsessed with it. I use it for everything. I have gaffer-taped my body before and it’s the best. There’s nothing better.”Mind you, Liz also claimed she never exercises. Which just goes to show that much of how we look is down to good fortune . . . and good genes.PERHAPS the best thing about getting married for a second time is this: The pressure to do it any way but your way is OFF.I love the fact that when Kate Garraway renews her vows with husband Derek Draper later this year, she is handing the planning reins for the ceremony to her teenage daughter.What a lovely way for the pair to include her. Although having a -year-old arrange your wedding could be . . . interesting.Some people don’t like the idea of renewing wedding vows. But I think it’s romantic.And since anything goes,my husband Paul and I ever do it, the ceremony will be in Las Vegas . . . with me dressed as Elvis.HOW sad – and how shocking – to read a new report saying hundreds of children died or were victims of abuse and neglect AFTER concerns for their welfare had already been raised with social services.It is incredibly dficult being a social worker. It’s one of the most stressful jobs there is.I sometimes wonder why the extended families of at-risk children are not more involved, often not until its too late.Social workers need more funding, more power to take action and all the training that can be made available to them.Maybe that would encourage more people to go into this vital service.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh James!Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson say the last-minute decision to postpone the film was made “after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace.”That sounds like the film has been pulled for commercial reasons rather than anything to do with deep concerns about public health.And fair enough — because apart from the makers of hand sanitisers, almost every business is going to take a hard knock from coronavirus.But is putting normal le on hold until the end of the year really the way to deal with coronavirus  Is it ultimately even good for business Struggling luxury car manu-facturer Aston Martin were looking forward to the Bond film boosting their sales — Aston Martin have four cars in Never Say Die — but now the firm will have to navigate most of  without the help of . I had already bought my tickets to see No Time To Die on the day it was scheduled to come out, Thursday, April .Frankly, seeing Ana de Armas as CIA agent Paloma in a cocktail dress slashed to the thigh wielding a semi-automatic felt like just what the doctor ordered in these dficult times.But perhaps the Bond producers are right. Who knows how bad things will be by next month It is possible nobody will feel like going to the pictures at the start of April, not even a hardcore Bond nut like me. This health emergency will get a lot worse before it gets better.But even with the tragic news of the first deaths in the UK, so far we have got off lightly compared with other European countries.Escalation here seems inescapable, evenwe all radically improve our personal hygiene. But whatever happens over the next couple of months, panic will only make it infinitely worse.We must all make our own decisions now about the risks we are prepared to take. But I can’t fight the feeling that James Bond has just wimped out big time.The Queen and  are our most famous British icons, forever linked after their brilliant double-act at the opening of the London  Olympics, when Daniel Craig rocked up at the Palace and the Queenparachuted into the Olympic stadium before the opening ceremony.And it is our -year-old monarch who is showing her nation how to act in the face of coronavirus.With her common sense, her calm and her bravery, the Queen has a lesson for us all. Do everything you can to keep yourself and others safe. But don’t stop living your le.The Queen, I suspect, would approve of Tinder’s advice to users to keep a “social distance” from potential partners.“While we want you to continue to have fun, protecting yourself from the coronavirus is more important,” urges the dating app.That seems like a sensible precaution for all young lovers. More hand sanitiser, darling DOG walker Lucy Hignett, , was understandably shocked and appalled when a parish magazine misprint suggested that her firm, Lead The Way, offered a “dog w***ing” service.Lucy, of Thorndon, Suffolk, said: “It was an absolutely horrendous situation. This was not my error. My ad was fine when I sent it.”Lucy’s mum Rachel commented, “You can imagine the amount of calls, texts and emails.“Many of which are supportive but many disgusting.”We can imagine! I mean, I’ve heard of spoiling your dog with treats, but that would be ridiculous.Is there anything more pathetic than dragging an unborn child into your political arguments When a couple announce they are having a baby, just wish them and the unborn innocent well.Andyou can’t do that – say nothing.THE tennis world was snfy when Maria Sharapova announced her retirement from the sport.Her suspension for a failed drugs test. The declining talents that sent Sharapova tumbling down the ­rankings.And the unspoken ­resentment that Maria’s appeal had as much to do with the way she looked as her cross-court backhand.But it takes some guts to keep ­playing a sport where you once won five Grand Slams and are suddenly ranked at number  in the world.Especially when you have career earnings of more than £million.“In giving my le to tennis,” Sharapova said in her surprisingly touching goodbye, “tennis gave me a le.”And as Maria demonstrates, no other world-class athlete could pass for a top model quite so convincingly.TURKEY’S president Recep Erdogan can no longer be bribed by the European Union into providing shelter for ­millions of refugees from Syria and beyond.“The doors are now open,” sneered Erdogan. “Now you [in Europe] will have to take your share of the burden.”Turkish people traffickers are slashing their prices, promising to get refugees into the EU for just £.With Turkey unwilling to keep the refugees any longer and countries in the EU ­unwilling to let them in, this will end badly.Footage emerged this week of the Greek coastguard firing gunshots into the sea just metres from a dinghy full of refugees.Thank God we are out.JOEY ESSEX paid a passionate tribute to our home county this week.“Without Essex, Great Britain would have a serious glamour shortage,” insisted our Joey.I felt a surge of Essex pride this week when a man in Basildon avoided being mugged at knepoint for his Rolex by throwing the expensive watch on a nearby roof. Brilliant!Somehow that seemed to sum up the spirit of Essex.Although I am not sure my memories of Essex are exactly the same as Joey’s.When I was growing up in Billericay in the Seventies, the only bright orange face you ever saw in Essex was on a space hopper.JOLYON MAUGHAM, the barrister who battered a fox to death with a baseball bat then boasted about it on social media, will not face prosecution for his actions.Sporting his we’s silk kimono, the -year-old QC found the fox trapped in wire in his London garden on Boxing Day last year.“Already this morning I have killed a fox with a baseball bat,” Maugham later tweeted with apparent pride. “How’s your Boxing Day going ”The RSPCA launched an investigation but says the fox did not endure “unnecessary suffering”.So a fox had its skull caved in with a baseball bat while terried and tangled in wire – but it didn’t suffer It is worth noting that Maugham did not provoke outrage simply because he killed a fox.What turned our stomachs was how much Jolyon seemed to enjoy it.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am confident the British people are ready to play their part in that.”Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed a report that , Britons could die from the coronavirus outbreak is the “worst case scenario”.Ms Sturgeon joined a COBRA meeting last week via teleconference.This virus will continue to spread, but the UK is a world leader in preparing for serious disease outbreaks like this.We are continuing to work to contain the virus, detecting cases as early as possible and tracing close contacts.It is now likely the virus is going to spread so we are stepping up planning to delay the peak of the outbreak to reduce the number of patients coming into the NHS during our busy winter period.We may in the future recommend certain measures, such as working from home or asking more vulnerable people to stay at home.But in doing so we must carefully balance social and economic costs against clinical effectiveness and the need to keep people safe.Both the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary have made dealing with this outbreak their top priority, with all departments working closely to control the situation.The Government will do everything in its power to tackle this disease, but we all need to play our part.We should all be looking out for our older friends, neighbours and family members.Health Secretary Matt Hancock also insisted the Government is doing “everything in its power” to delay and mitigate the coronavirus threat as the number of infected people in the UK topped .Mr Hancock said: “We will do all we can to contain coronavirus, but, as we know, Covid- is spreading across the world, so I want to ensure Government is doing everything in its power to be ready to delay and mitigate this threat.“Public safety is my top priority.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Covid- crisis was born in Wuhan and raises red-flag warnings over the country’s future prosperity and stability.Coronavirus is no joke but I am glad to say the opportunity is all ours. It gives us cover to do things we might never have otherwise dared.New Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his first Budget on Wednesday to seize that chance with both hands.“We go into this in a very strong position,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “We need to make sure we respond at scale to whatever scenario comes our way.”This will be no “safety first” Budget. The coronavirus health emergency provides an option to be bold.It unlocks the Treasury stranglehold on spending, borrowing, infrastructure and, crucially, tax reform.Cash will be unleashed first into the NHS, with food and medical supplies a priority for the sick and elderly, plus emergency welfare for those whose earnings suddenly dry up.But there will also be money for big projects — schools, roads and railways and, with another deluge of rain on its way, a welcome doubling of spending on flood defences to £.BILLION.There will be both tax cuts and rises, but plans for a hike in fuel duty will be ditched, I gather.“Our public finances are in good shape,” the Chancellor insists. “I will lay the foundations for future growth and prosperity, level up the country and spread opportunity.”In other words, what is good for Britain’s physical health is also good for economic well-being.The way the world does business changed abruptly when Beijing celebrated Chinese New Year by shutting down most of the country.Today the “workshop of the world” is silent — with alarming implications for a regime whose authority depends on feeding nearly a fth of the planet’s population.Global giants including Volkswagen and Mercedes in Germany, and Apple in the USA, whose vital supply lines have been severed, are weighing their options.Thanks to Donald Trump’s trade wars, they were already reassessing their reliance on cheap but now unreliable overseas labour. The revival of “Rust Belt” cities and recruitment of local workers back home will accelerate.Others with no interest in capitalism are also finding opportunities.We may look back on those “before and after” satellite images of noxious nitrogen- dioxide clouds over China, and the clear blue skies today, as a turning point.Extinction Rebellion protesters might start digging up turf outside the Chinese Embassy, instead of vandalising Cambridge University.We will also notice a drop in air pollution after the collapse of shipping and plane travel.Ships carry  per cent of world trade but burn the heaviest oil, from the dirtiest dregs of a barrel of crude.Greta Thunberg and her “climate emergency” apostles will pounce on this evidence that we can live on fresh air.More seriously, we may be witnessing the end of globalisation — the spread of interlocking world trade which has raised living standards and spread prosperity for millions.It leaves Britain with the opportunity to pick up some of the slack.Ministers are already encouraging firms to raise productivity by swapping cheap migrant labour for expensive but efficient robot technology.The crisis will also have an impact on negotiations with the European Union.Britain is well placed, as a nimble sovereign nation with its own floating currency, to take advantage of fast-moving developments.We have low inflation, low unemployment, a near-record number in work and strong public finances.For the European Union, with its straitjacket single currency and paralysing regulation, the coronavirus crisis has no upside.Hundreds of firms and zombie banks are near collapse — including German giant Deutsche Bank. A downturn will hit firms and raise unemployment, already double the UK rate.EU negotiator Michel Barnier will soon have to choose — between the danger of a No Deal Brexit in December and the opportunity of a Canada-style arrangement which benefits all sides.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And aside from the vile trolls in that cesspit otherwise known as social media, most of it was fair and balanced.Like, for example, the couple preaching about our carbon footprints and the need to change our behaviour, while taking four private jet flights in  days.They may not have liked it, but they clearly thought about those objections because the couple now claim they will do what they can to fly commercially.There were many objections from within the Royal Family about the couple’s behaviour and demands – and there are two sides to this story.Many courtiers will tell you Harry and Meghan were rude and didn’t respect the hierarchy and pecking order that’s essential for smooth royal operations.But those close to Harry and Meghan have a very dferent perspective. They’ve told me that the couple felt they were under attack by royal staff members and other households from day one.We worried about the obvious changes to Harry, who went from happy go lucky to angry and brittle.We also questioned why so many of Meghan’s old friends and family members – including her own father Thomas – were no longer in her le.From a personal perspective, I value my school friends and blood relatives more than anyone  because they’ve known me for so long and know how to bring me down to earth whenever that might be required.But those small criticisms pale into insignicance when you compare the column inches and media coverage devoted to the issues that Harry and Meghan care about.Watching Meghan on stage at Robert Clack School in Dagenham working the crowd of teenagers like a true Hollywood princess, it’s very obvious the Royal Family are about to lose a superstar – and no one is celebrating that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On housing we have taken a step back, generationally.Whereas my family could be certain of a secure home with a rent we could afford, too many young people today will never know what a stable foundation like that can do for them.A proper home lets people get on with their lives, get their children into a good school, start a business, get involved in the community.These are great British traits that the Conservative Party should be fighting for every day. After all, we created Right To Buy, which has been a great source of stability and mobility for millions, and a triumph of Tory values.However, we now need to reorient the policy so the great opportunities we continue to offer to people with Right To Buy are more than matched by building new social housing to replace what we sell.This is importantwe want to give more people the same chance I had. Shelter recently found there was a net loss of , council houses last year as a result of demolitions and properties sold off through Right To Buy.This is happening while thousands of hard-working families sit on social housing waiting lists, desperate for a shot at the stability they cannot find anywhere .Runaway house prices mean owning your own home has become a distant dream for many lower-paid workers — receptionists, hospital porters, teaching assistants.These hard-working people still deserve a secure home. In the past  years alone house prices in England have grown at twice the pace of wages.The average home increased in value by  per cent between  and , while wages only grew by  per cent.Investing in social housing should be a deeply Conservative ideal. It gives people a  on which to build their lives, to progress and to grow. It is an essential element of a society that values social mobility.After all, it was a Conservative-led council in Liverpool that built the first ever council house as far back as .At last year’s General Election, people up and down the country, many from poorer backgrounds and living in social housing, put their trust in the Conservative Party to deliver for them.If our policies simply continue to provide only expensive new-builds for the already well-off, and almost unaffordable rents for the rest, then people might be left wonderingthat trust was misplaced.By building up our nation’s social housing and ensuring there is sufficient stock of affordable homes, we can give people a chance of a good home and deliver on our promises of fairness and aspiration.There is a world of dference between my childhood home and the grim high-rises that have come to define social housing for many today.But done right, new social housing can create thriving community hubs, minimise crime and be as appealing as new garden villages and towns. You need only to look at Goldsmith Street, the award-winning new development in Norwich, to know this vision is achievable.But warm words alone won’t build good-quality, affordable homes. We need money to build, and the Budget is a chance to signal the party is serious about tackling housing inequality head on.I’ve led a group of  fellow Conservative MPs from across the country and one Conservative metro mayor to call on the Chancellor to let our voters know whose side we are on. We have sent him a letter, an edited version of which is above.Many of us have felt the benefits of social housing in our own lives and we want the next generation to have the same shot at success we did. I hope our new Chancellor listens to our call in his Budget.A secure home lets people get on with their lives, look after their families and grow their businesses without having to worry about damp and draughts damaging their children’s health or a sudden hike in rent ending their dreams.Ensuring this means building up our nation’s offer of social homes. This has been ignored for too many decades. If our policies simply continue to provide only unaffordable housing, the people will never forgive us.However,we are the party that finally delivers the social and other high-quality affordable housing this country needs, they will never forget us.We need the money to build and renovate our available stock, and reform of the planning and laws around land to make it easier to get the social homes built.We believe this year’s Budget is the chance to signal that we will be serious about making this happen.Yours sincerely, DavidOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Supermarket bosses held crisis talks this evening with Environment Secretary George Eustice on how to help vulnerable people get home deliveries -they are forced to self-isolate due to COVID- Customers have reported week-long delays for delivery slots as panic-buyers strip products like toilet paper and hand soap from shelves, despite government warnings not to. Current rules mean that deliveries are banned overnight so that vehicles do not disturb residents.The government will temporarily relax the enforcement of restrictions to give greater flexibility, a spokesman confirmed tonight. Deliveries are also partly hemmed in by complex restrictions on when firms can turn up at your door - including in anti-social hours like the early morning or late at night. Now the government can also widen the ability to make deliveries using a seldom-used power under the  Competition Act. The Act bans supermarkets from abusing their position by working together over how they sell goods. But the government can suspend these rulesthere is an exception and compelling reason - a power used four times in the last two decades, including in the  fuel crisis. It is understood the possibility of triggering this exception for a fth time was to be discussed in the conference call between supermarket giants and Mr Eustice this evening. A government source said: One of the issues which we are looking at very keenly is this idea of lting restrictions on when supermarket home deliveries can take place, to give them greater flexibility. Shoppers concerned about having to self-isolate amid the spread of coronavirus in the UK have sparked Christmas-level demand for some items. Tesco has limited the sale of goods such as pasta and long-le milk, while a number of major stores are joining them in restricting sales of hygiene products such as hand sanitiser.  But shoppers have been assured there is no need to stockpile and warned against doing so, after images emerged of empty shelves in stores in some areas of the country. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said todayaposs meeting would look at “support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation. He insisted the UK “continues to have a resilient supply chain” and the government will ensure that “continues to be the case”, with no need to panic-buy key goods. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs food supplies will continue even in the reasonable worst-case scenario. Speaking in the Commons, he said: We are confident that food supply will continue even in our reasonable worst-case scenario.

Will the minister work to ensure claimants get proper debt advice before requesting an advance and look to signicantly extend the repayment period  "},{"url":null,"title":"beauty queen shares make up","story":"NewsBeauty queen shares make-up free photos of her acne - and is stunned by the reactionLauren Parkinson, from North Wales, was travelling the world taking part in beauty contests when she was struck down with chronic acneShareByAnn CusackJane LavenderAssistant Editor:,  MAR NewsLauren is a beauty queen \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs a beauty queen Lauren Parkinson has travelled the world and stayed in some of the most luxurious hotels on the planet. The former Grand Miss Wales winner seemed full of confidence but her world fell apart when she suddenly developed extreme acne while competing in an international beauty pageant. Lauren just wanted to shut herself away and hid her skin issues behind make-up and social media filters - never revealing her true face. But now the -year-old had bravely decided to share her apostrueapos skin with the world - and has been stunned by the response. Lauren, from Chirk, North Wales, is now preparing to compete in the prestigious Miss Wales contest next month and has her sights set on the Miss World title. She said: You shouldn’t have to hide away from acne. I’m very guilty of over-editing pictures and feeling like I need to airbrush pictures to be at a certain standard for social media, until I just decided one day that I couldn’t carry on doing that. I’ve had parents contacting me saying I’ve really helped their kids and teenagers saying I’ve made them feel much better. Lauren had suffered with mild acne when she was a teenager but took it all in her stride.  She said: Having the odd spot or two can be irritating, but bearable. It was no big deal, really. A lot of my friends were experiencing greasy skin and spots etc. It did make me self-conscious, but it wasn’t really a problem. It was only when I got into to my twenties that it really started to get out of hand. They seemed to come with a vengeance. But then in October , while she was at a huge event in Myanmar, South East Asia, Laurenaposs face erupted in acne.  She said: I had to cover up the best I could and go out on stage in front of thousands of people. My face was plastered over internet sites and social media pages with millions of followers. The stress of being in such a massive spotlight was almost too much to bear.” I had negative comments and people pointing the finger at me because of my spots. It was horrendous. I felt like I could not go out without people staring at me. Her GP prescribed several dferent types of antibiotics but nothing seemed to work and Lauren was sent to hospital to see a dermatologist. She said: I was put on Roaccutane, which is a very controversial drug. It can cause severe depression and psychosis among other harsh side effects. I couldn’t wear make-up during the drug treatment because it could make my acne worse. So, I was avoiding it in everyday le unless I was going to an event which meant I would have to wear it. I was working without wearing make-up and some of the comments I received from people were quite nasty. I remember over-hearing a woman saying to her young daughter ‘look at her face’. Other times people would stop in the supermarket and give me advice. I felt like I was dying inside. I just wanted to be left alone. The medication works by bringing the acne out more before it gets better, so I had to deal with comments like that. It can knock your confidence at times. But after shutting herself away, Lauren decided to bare all in social media and talk openly about acne. She started sharing her story and her photos in in a bid to encourage people to not feel ashamed. She said: When competing in beauty pageants, you’re doing things where you have to present yourself to a certain standard, so that was dficult. It can knock your confidence when you have to face every day with acne on your face. I’ve shared through social media before and after pictures, and kept people updated throughout the progress. Parents of younger girls got in touch with me to say their daughters had been struggling with acne and seeing me being so open about it and honest has helped them to deal with it. “It’s not something that you have to hide behind, it’s something you just have to learn to embrace because it does get better. “You shouldn’t have to hide away from it. I just decided it was best to confront it. And she has words of warning for people who rely on social media for a confidence boost. Lauren said: Social media makes it quite dficult for younger people, because they can often feel there is such a high standard that they have to achieve.” My friends and family, in particular my mum and two best friends, helped me to get through the dficult periods of having acne.

The proposal comes as two more Brits died from the bug, bringing the death toll to five. And the number of cases rose from  to  today. Both the latest victims were in their s with underlying health conditions. England’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said: “We are now close to the time, probably within the next  to  days, when we should move to a ­situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be ­self-isolating for a period of seven days. “We will be having to ask members of the public to do dferent things than they would normally do. There is a riskwe go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be dficult to sustain this over time.” Common symptoms are fever, fatigue and dry cough. Downing Street said from today every hospital patient with respiratory tract infections or ­pneumonia will be tested for ­Covid-. Boris Johnson added: “There is no hiding from the fact that the ­coronavirus outbreak will present ­challenges. Butwe continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge.“We are preparing actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS.”  The PM said the UK remains in the “containment” phase of tackling the spread but will move onto “delay” once the outbreak becomes widespread. That could mean introducing measures such as social distancing. A man died at Wolverhampton from ­coronavirus and a patient, with a number of signicant and long-term health ­conditions, passed away at Epsom and St Helier University ­Hospitals NHS Trust in South London. The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust said: “A patient in their s being treated for underlying health conditions has died. The patient had tested positive for Covid-.” Two further cases have been confirmed in the city. ­Herefordshire had its first case as did the Royal Borough of Windsor and ­Maidenhead. There were two more in Cornwall. Plymouth crown court shut down after a coronavirus scare. A man due to go on trial entered the dock and was advised to call , self isolate and speak to his GP. It is believed to be the first court to be shut down over the crisis. There were also confirmed cases at a ­Transport for London office, Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, Liverpool’s Aintree University Hospital and Oxford University, where a second student tested positive. Numbers of cases are expected to double every two to three days.  Experts believe between % and % of the population will contract Covid- and around , people will die. Universal credit claimants who have to self-isolatethey contract Covid- will not be sanctioned, a minister confirmed. Public Health England are to roll out enhanced monitoring of flights from all parts of Italy from Wednesday. The country has the highest number of confirmed cases outside China at ,, with  deaths. Tens of thousands of Brits have had their holiday plans there thrown into chaos. All St Patrick’s Day parades in Ireland next Tuesday are to be cancelled in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed the Government will repatriate more than  UK tourists on board Grand Princess. The cruise liner has been blocked from ­Calornia ports since Thursday after passengers tested positive for ­coronavirus. It finally docked at Oakland last night and guests were being taken to healthcare facilities or ­quarantine stations. Mr Hancock said: “The US are planning for a flight to leave tomorrow.”Research in China, the epicentre of the global outbreak, found being older, showing signs of sepsis and having blood clots are key factors associated with a higher risk of death with coronavirus.Numbers of new infections are now falling in the country thanks to measures such as locking down entire cities. Q: Will my pension be affected  A: It depends what type of pension you’re paying into, how far off retirement you are, oryou have already retired. As a general rule of thumb, the longer you are from retiring, the less reason there is to be concerned. Q: I’ve got a private pension and am a few months off retiring  A: The closer you get to retiring, the more of your pot your pension provider will sht from equitiesinto other assets, such as cash. Doing so will limit the impact of the slump should you opt for an annuity – an insurance policy that pays out in retirement. Q: I’m retired and I opted for a drawdown pension. How am I affected  A: Drawdowns allow you to flexibly take cash out of your pension pot as and when you want. But your funds remain invested and, therefore, at the mercy of stock markets, so can go down as well as up. Q: I’m in a defined benefit pension, including a final salary scheme, will I be affected  A: Unlikely. While the share slump could well hit the fund you’re in, it’s the responsibility of the firm that’s behind it. As long as the firm – or “sponsor” – is doing OK, you’ll be fine."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus butcher praised generous act","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Butcher praised for generous act of kindness amid Covid- panicA butcher has gone viral on social media after selflessly offering to help those in need as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK continues to riseShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsDave Jones is being praised for his act of kindness \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It comes as the number of cases in the UK has risen to  and five deaths have been recorded - as of Monday evening. While the college has confirmed pregnant women do not appear to be more susceptible to the consequences of coronavirus than the general population, they have said special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses until evidence provides clearer information.The published document also states that a fetus is aposunlikely to be exposedapos to the virus during pregnancy after a series of swabs and samples taken from COVID- infected mothers tested negative, reports the Manchester Evening News . Although more severe symptoms such as pneumonia are widely described with COVID- in older people, those with weaker immune systems, and those with long-term conditions such as diabetes, these symptoms could occur in pregnant women and so should be identied and treated promptly, says the report. At present, there is one reported case of a woman with COVID- who required mechanical ventilation at  weeks’ gestation, following which she had an emergency cesarean section and made a good recovery. The report continues to say that no data suggests an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to the virus.  General advice for expectant mums says to call NHS they are concerned about exposure or have symptoms indicating possible infection. And the same goes for women ing from areas of the world which indicate a possible increased risk of transmission. Pregnant women who have been advised to self-isolate should stay indoors and avoid contact with others for  days, the report adds. It continues: Women should be advised to contact their maternity care provider , to discuss attendance for routine antenatal appointments.  Pregnant women who are due to attend routine maternity appointments in the UK should contact their maternity care provider, to inform them that they are currently in self-isolation for possible confirmed COVID-, and request advice on attendance. Pregnant women are advised not to attend maternity triage units or AE unless in need of urgent obstetric or medical care. If women are concerned and require urgent medical advice, they are encouraged to call the maternity triage unit in the first instance. If attendance at the maternity unit or hospital is advised, pregnant women are requested to travel by private transport and alert the maternity triage reception once on the premises, prior to entering the hospital.

Poplar and Limehouse in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets is a modern day tale of two cities. Punitive welfare policies, low wages and soaring housing costs have pushed more and more families below the breadline. Since the Tories came to power in  child poverty in the UK has soared by more half a million from . million to . million. According to figures complied by charity End Child Poverty, the constituency tops the shameful league table with a concerning .% of youngsters living in poverty once housing costs are included. Are you a parent struggling with poverty  Email webnews@mirror Yet because of its location next to Canary Wharf, home to high-earning bankers and other workers in the financial industry, the true deprivation and social economic woes can be skewed by figures such as the average wage in the borough. Our Give Me Five campaign wants an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lt , children out of destitution. We also want the Government to restore child tax credits, to scrap the two-child limit and to axe the benefit cap.reporter Lorraine King visited Poplar and Limehouse to find out why it is Britainaposs child poverty capital. aposWe have some of the richest people in London living next to the poorestapos Poplar and Limehouse is also in the midst of gentrication which has resulted in a huge gulf between the rich and poor. There are multi-million pound homes saddled next to social housing. Surging house prices and rents in the capital means it is becoming more popular with high-earning bankers and financial workers who want a quick commute to Canary wharf. This means that poor families have less of a choice when it comes to which houses they can afford to rent.  James King is a councillor for Poplar and Limehouse and says housing is one of the biggest issues surrounding child poverty. He told : There is a crisis going on with child poverty. Iaposve been involved with politics for  years now and I have seen how the area has changed through gentrication but the child poverty remains the same. Child poverty has been an issue in Tower Hamlets as a borough for a very long time. We have some of the richest people in London living next door to some of the poorest.  Housing in the private sector here is becoming more and more unaffordable but people still need to live around here because itaposs their community - their jobs are here, their families are here. But because housing is so unaffordable people are living in overcrowded conditions and that leads together issues such as damp that causes health issues. Juli is a married mum-of-five who has lived in east London for most of her le until her private landlord doubled her rent and she found herself homeless. * Read more about our Give Me Five campaign She sought help from the council who moved her out of the borough to an address  miles away in Enfield. The -year-old couldnapost afford the train fares to take her two youngest children to school she was forced to rely solely on buses. She said: This meant getting up at am to make sure we got to school before am. But sometimes the journey was too long for my youngest daughter and she would end up wetting herself as we never passed any toilets on the way.  It was horrible but we had no choice I couldnapost afford to get a train so I started bringing a change of clothes for when she did have a accident. According to the council, there are more than , households on their housing list but they grant just , tenancies a year. Dad-of-two Abdul Hamid is on the housing list but in the meantime he is being forced to rent a one-bedroom flat privately for £, a month. He said: Because Iaposm renting privately and not homeless my family is not a priority. I have been bidding for lots of homes but nothing so far. Rent privately is what has pushed my family into poverty.  aposGovernment cuts are forcing people to turn to charitiesapos Since , Tower Hamlets Council has been forced to make £m cuts to cope with a financial blackhole caused by a decrease in government funding. Figures by the National Education Union also shows that schools in the borough have lost a whooping £million of funding since  - the equivalent of £ per pupil. Paul Garayo, is the chief executive of Limehouse-based arts and community charity Stitches in Time, which teaches women in the area valuable dressmaking skills to help them crawl out of poverty. He said: Government cuts are forcing people to turn to charities like Stitches in Time.  Thereaposs a lot of provision that the local government miss out and people fall through the cracks. We provide a safe space so people can florish. We allow people to realise their aspirations and build up skills that can help them find employment. Local councillor James King said: The council has felt increasing challenges when it comes to funding because most of their funding comes from the Government. We have to make a couple million of cuts every single year. We try and protect the services that help the most vulnerable like childrenaposs social care. We want the government to give more power to the local authorities this will allow us to let people have more say about their own lives. Itaposs unfair that the government has a say on whether councils can run properly or not. It should be fairer than that.  aposUniversal Credit has made serious problems for familiesapos The Governmentaposs controversial benefits system has been blamed on plunging more families into poverty. Research by the council into Universal Credit found that so many residents were struggling to make ends meet that they set up a £.miliion poverty fund to help plug the gap. Out of the funds, £m was ring-fenced for the most vulnerable families facing waits of up to five week for any money as they switched to Universal Credit. Tower Hamlets Mayor John Biggs said: Universal Credit has made serious problems for families.  “We were one of the first boroughs to be fully transitioned onto Universal Credit so we are well aware that its introduction has presented serious challenges for our residents. Deputy Mayor Rachael Blake is also the boroughaposs cabinet member tasked with tackling poverty. She toldthat Universal Credit has been identied as one of the biggest causes of poverty in the borough. It is driving people into further poverty and debt and the housing costs. This is why we set up the poverty fund so we can help the most vulnerable people and support them as much as we can. Some people are unaware that they are entitled to other benefits so we have an outreach team to make sure they care claiming everything they are entitled to.  aposThis has always been an area with a lot of Bengali peopleapos Tower Hamlets has the largest Bangladeshi population in the county. The  Census showed the Bengali community made up  per cent of people living in the borough. This is compared to the community making up three per cent of the population in London and just one per cent in England. In  a report called aposEthnic Inequalitiesapos by the Centre for Social Investigation   claimed that British Bangladeshis are around three times more likely to be in poverty compared to their white counterparts. It also claimed people from the Bengali community were more likely to be lower-skilled in living in overcrowded conditions which fuels poverty.

Kate, wearing a royal blue gown by Jenny Packham with embellishment detailing and a matching clutch bag, was greeted by teachers and children from Cranbrook School, the New North Academy and Salusbury Primary School. The mum-of-three, who has made childrenaposs right and mental health a staple part of her work as a royal, has been patron of PlaceBe since . She told the anniversary event that the charity had taught her that the simplest things can make a dference to a childaposs wellbeing. You taught me, right from the start, that the children in your schools are only as happy and emotionally strong as the adults in their care, the duchess said. That is why you take such great pride in the work you do with your teachers and your parents. You taught me the importance of creating safe and nurturing environments within schools, embracing a holistic view of emotional wellbeing which permeates through the whole school system. You also taught me that itaposs the simplest things that make a dference to children.Itaposs the quality time that is spent with them. Itaposs the time you take to listen to them. It is trusting relationships that have the most profound impact on the emotional and mental wellbeing of a child. Kate told the event there was now a much greater awareness of childrenaposs mental health, adding that PlaceBeaposs services have never been more needed. She said: I can remember saying after my visit to Willows School in  that I thought every school in this country should have PlaceBe. Imagine the dference it would make to thousands,not millions, more children, teachers and parents,this vision was a reality. Founded in  by Dame Benny Refson, the charity has worked with more than , children and families over the past  years. Kate helped launch the first ever Children’s Mental Health Week in . This year’s theme was Find Your Brave – highlighting that bravery isn’t about coping alone or holding things in, it can be about sharing worries and asking for help, trying something new or pushing yourself outside your comfort zone.Earlier in the day, Kate attended the annual Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey. She wore a red coat by Catherine Walker and hat by Sally-Ann Provan. The service at Westminster Abbey marked the final royal engagement for Meghan and Harry before they embark on their new le in North America.

Describing the Sussexesapos reununion with Kate and William, Judi said it was a rather odd greeting ritual.

The Prince of Wales met a line of guests after his arrival to Westminster Abbey this afternoon - where he used an alternative greeting gesture. Instead of a handshake, the heir to the throne, aged ,  smiled and offered guests a namaste gesture - which saw him join his palms together and gently bow his head. The opening to the service saw very few handshakes exchanged, with confirmed cases in the UK now standing at . In another change from last yearaposs service, the Sussexes were shown to their seats and did not wait at the Abbeyaposs great west door to meet the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Queen before processing with the other royals at the start of the ceremony.The move is likely to be interpreted by commentators as their impending exit from The Firm - dubbed Megxit - although the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, unlike last year, also took their place in the ,-strong congregation and not the procession through the Abbey. When Meghan and Harry first arrived they were greeted by the Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle, and met a group of dignitaries including Boris Johnson and the Commonwealthaposs secretary-general Baroness Scotland. The ceremony - the Sussexesapos final public outing in their UK farewell tour - is a poignant milestone as they prepare to embark on their future away from the royal family.  From March , the monarchaposs grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new le of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America. On that date Meghan will bow out of royal le just one year,  months and  days - or  days - after marrying into the family. At todayaposs event, Sussexes and Cambridges are not sat on the same row. Meghan was seen to mouth “hi” and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a “hello”, as the Cambridges took their seat in the High Altar in the row in front of the Sussexes.  Harry also said “hello” and smiled at his brother. Edward partly rose to greet the Cambridges, but Sophie and the Sussexes remained seated. Meghan later chatted animatedly to Edward as they waited for the Queen to arrive, with Harry joining in the conversation and putting his arm on the back of Meghan’s chair as he did so. Meghan and Harry have attended the annual event, which celebrates all of the countries in the Commonwealth, for the past two years. Todayaposs event is being broadcast live on BBC One and will include a reflection by boxing star Anthony Joshua and performances by Craig David and Alexandra Burke.  Itaposs the first time Meghan and Harry have been seen publicly with the Royal Family since they announced their plans to quit. Their decision is said to have caused a lot of anger and upset behind Palace walls, and they reportedly didnapost consult their relatives before releasing their shock statement. Announcing the news on their Instagram page in January, they said they want to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.

This is particularly striking when we see people from nations, large and small, gathering for the Commonwealth Games, for meetings of Commonwealth governments, and on Commonwealth Day.  Such a blend of traditions serves to make us stronger, inidually and collectively, by providing the ingredients needed for social, political and economic resilience.  Throughout my le, I have had the opportunity to see and hear how membership of the Commonwealth family means so much to those living in all parts of the world, often in places that are quite remote.  Advances in technology and modern media have now enabled many more people to witness and enjoy - with remarkable immediacy - this experience of Commonwealth connection, in areas such as education, medicine and conservation. Looking to the future, this connectivity means we are also aware, perhaps as never before, that wherever we live, our choices and actions affect the well-being of people and communities living far away, and in very dferent circumstances.

Kate is a big fan of colour co-ordinating, and today matched her red dress to husband Prince Williamaposs tie. She wore a gorgeous Catherine Walker coat with a hat by Sally-Ann Provan. The Duchess also used the matching trick when it comes to her children George, Charlotte and Louis. The Cambridge family often all wear the same colour when out and about, the most recent example being Christmas Day where they all wore something green.  Todayaposs service, which Meghan and Harry have attended for the past two years, marks the end of their farewell tour of the UK before they move to Canada. Their visit as included the Endeavour Fund Awards, a military musical festival at the Royal Albert Hall and Meghanaposs secret visit to a school in Dagenham, east London, to celebrate International Womenaposs Day. The couple do not officially step down from their roles as working members of the royal family until March , but the service - broadcast around the globe on the BBC World Service - was the symbolic end of their le supporting the Queen.  Meghan was seen to mouth hi and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a hello, as the Cambridges took their seat in the High Altar in the row in front of the Sussexes. Harry also said hello and smiled at his brother. Edward partly rose to greet the Cambridges, but Sophie and the Sussexes remained seated. Meghan later chatted animatedly to Edward as they waited for the Queen to arrive, with Harry joining in the conversation and putting his arm on the back of Meghanaposs chair as he did so.

Thamima shared a cramped council house with her parents and three siblings which was so overcrowded she struggled to do her schoolwork. But the youngster was determined to educate her way out of the poverty trap and has been rewarded by being offered a place at one of Britainaposs top universities.Thamima, , was born and bred in Poplar and Limehouse in east London - the area in the UK with the highest level of child poverty. Her story comes after the Mirror launched our Give Me Five campaign in a bid to end the scourge of child poverty in the UK.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror Our Give Me Five is calling on Boris Johnson to hike child benefit by £ a week to help struggling parents. Without action the number of kids in poverty in the UK is set to rise from .million to .million in the next two years.Despite Thamima excelling at school, the A-level student says growing up in poverty is a stressful experience for youngsters with cramped, overcrowded conditions exacerbating the issue. Thamima said: The stress a child feels living in poverty does affect them mentally. They see their parents stress over money and the bills. I grew up in a two-bedroom council house with six peopleso overcrowding is normal to me. Weaposve been on the waiting list for a bigger house for seven years and it hasnapost worked out. Itaposs a similar situation for lots of families here who have been on the list for years and years because there is such a shortage of housing. Thamima said she aims to educate her way out of poverty but it can be a struggle for other children living in a similar situation. I applied for a £ education maintenance grant last year which helped me to buy stationary and text books she said.  It has now been axed and thataposs a slap n the face for poorer students. * Read more about our Give Me Five campaignFor some itaposs make or breakthey canapost afford to go into higher education. If you donapost have the money to buy your text books when you get to do your A-levels that makes a massive dference and puts you at a disadvantage. Itaposs the small things that can make a dference. I didnapost have a desk that I could sit at and do my homework, there just wasnapost that space.Last year, Tower Hamlets Council launched a £.million poverty fund to help the poorest residents in the borough with £m being allocated to Universal Credit claimants waiting for their payments.Thamima said: The council are trying to tackle poverty but because they rely on Government funding there is a limit to what they can do. The Government is out of touch about child poverty and how it affects people. They canapost penalise a parent and not expect it to affect their children while they talk about tackling poverty - itaposs illogical. Funding needs to be given back to local governments as they know their communities and where the money is needed. Tower Hamlets deputy mayor Rachel Blake told the Mirror that rising rents and Universal Credit were the biggest issues for poor families in the borough.  She said: We need to have a social security system that is generally supportive rather than penalising people. Universal Credit is driving people into further poverty and debt plus they face rising housing costs. We have seen more and more people having to use their own cash to make up their shortfall in rent.

Whitmore Park Primary School in Halford Lane, Keresley Heath, is currently undergoing a deep cleaning programme after the youngster contracted the highly contagious infection. Coventry Live reports a letter was sent to parents and carers on Friday and states that a thorough deep clean had started over the weekend. Parents have been told that there is no need to worry and that the risk to other children is low. The school is expected to reopen on Tuesday. Jacqueline McGibney, the schoolaposs headteacher, said: “The Health and wellbeing of our pupils and staff are of the utmost importance, so we are taking advice from the health professionals at Public Health England and the Environmental Health team at Coventry City Council following the confirmation of a case of typhoid in one of our pupils.” She added: We take the health of our pupils and staff very seriously and have been working closely with Public Health England who have advised us that the risk to children is low. “We have a well-managed cleaning regime which follows the advice of the council’s environmental health team. We have been keeping parents up to date and fully expect to open as normal tomorrow.”  Public Health England confirmed this evening that it is working with Coventry City Council concerning a confirmed case of typhoid in a child that attends Whitmore Park Primary School.The infection is believed to be travel-related and the child has been receiving antibiotics and is now feeling much improved. A small number of close contacts of the case have been asked for blood and stool samples, for lab testing, and the school has been advised to undergo a thorough clean with bleach-based products.The school decided to perform a deep clean over the weekend, which will take three days – hence remaining closed today to complete cleaning and reopening on Tuesday. Angela Cartwright, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control with PHE West Midlands Health Protection Team, said: “Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection which is uncommon in the UK, with an estimated  cases each year, generally related to foreign travel to countries at high risk including those in South Asia, Africa and South America.The infection is caused by bacteria called Salmonella typhi, and transmission is through the stoolsand, less commonly, the urine. In countries with poor sanitation, water can be infected with the bacteria, and people drinking contaminated water or eating food cooked or washed in contaminated water can become infected with the bacteria and develop typhoid fever.” Ms Cartwright added: “The risk to other children at the school is low, but as a precaution, we are testing a small number of close contacts.If typhoid fever is left untreated, symptoms will worsen over time, and there is a risk of developing serious complications – so it’s important for people with symptoms to contact their GP or call NHS .Prompt treatment with antibiotics is important, and cases diagnosed early usually recover after a  to -day course of treatment. “Good hygiene is the best way to prevent illnesses such as typhoid, colds and flu.Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly using soap and water for at least  seconds at a time is the best advice for these kind of illnesses, especially after using the toilet and before preparing and eating food or drinks."},{"url":null,"title":"uks first gay dad twins","story":"NewsUKs first gay dad of twins now expecting triplets with daughter’s ex-boyfriendBarrie Drewitt-Barlow and Scott Hutchinson are \"pregnant\" with three girls via a surrogate and Barrie says husband Tony, who he still lives with in Florida, is supportiveShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAR NewsBarrie Drewitt-Barlow and Scott are having triplets\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

One savvy mum one mum has spotted an almost identical dupe on the high street for a fraction of the cost of the high end original.Amy Roberts, from Yorkshire, shared a post to her Facebook page of all the Pandora dupes she had found in the high street store.She captioned the post: Warren james vs Pandora, and in no time at all the post went viral. Amy shared  side-by-side images of the products you can buy in Warren James with prices ranging from £ to £ - considerably cheaper than any of Pandoraaposs items. The most expensive Pandora piece was its Round Sparkle Halo, which usually retails for £ on the Pandora website, but at Warren James, you can pick it up for a mere £ - bargain. It received nearly , likes, , comments and , shares in under a week. And it left many Pandora fans wishing theyaposd done their research before splurging on the high-priced pieces.  One person said: I have worn a Warren James dress ring constantly for  years. I dont remove it to wash or do cleaning. Itaposs not discoloured, not bent, the stones are nice and bright. It cost about £. So I reckon thats a pretty good recommendation and a well spent £. Another said: I have the pandora version, look at the money that could have been saved.

Shoppers have also reported loo roll being stored behind the cigarette counter, available on request, in Woolworths in Melbourne. One customer said they had been in the store to discover the bathroom aide was on lockdown. They wrote online: Woolworths near me is now handing out packs of toilet paper on request from the cigarette counter because people donapost know how to behave themselves. A representative of the store rebuked the suggestion, telling MailOnline that only hand sanitiser was given to customers in such a way. In recent days security has been ramped up in some supermarkets as certain items become scarce. A security guard clad in black was photographed hovering protectively near a pile of  roll-packs of Quilton in a Coles store.A spokesperson for the supermarket told news said: We have made the decision to change the limit to one pack per customer so that toilet rolls are available for more of our customers, particularly the elderly and people who are unable to purchase in large volumes. The number of positive cases of coronavirus in Australia has signicantly in recent weeks. There have now been more than  cases and three deaths so far. In the UK time restrictions on getting a home delivery from your supermarket could be axed to help retail giants meet a huge surge in demand. Supermarket bosses held crisis talks this evening with Environment Secretary George Eustice on how to help vulnerable people get home deliveries -they are forced to self-isolate due to COVID-.  Customers have reported week-long delays for delivery slots as panic-buyers strip products like toilet paper and hand soap from shelves, despite government warnings not to.Those deliveries are partly hemmed in by complex restrictions on when firms can turn up at your door - including in anti-social hours like the early morning or late at night. Shoppers concerned about having to self-isolate amid the spread of coronavirus in the UK have sparked Christmas-level demand for some items.  Tesco has limited the sale of goods such as pasta and long-le milk, while a number of major stores are joining them in restricting sales of hygiene products such as hand sanitiser. In the House of Commons today Health Secretary Matt Hancock attempted to calm those worried about shortages in shops.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/shutterstock_editorial_AyrvDundee_10575546S.jpg ","title":"james mcpake expects dee to be better on own patch","story":"James McPake reckons Dundee’s battling qualities won them a point at Ayr.But the Dark Blues boss insists skill will come to the fore against the Honest Men at Dens Park.The Dee face Mark Kerr’s side again tomorrow night in a clash that could have a massive bearing on the Championship play-off race.Saturday’s goalless draw between the sides was a stuffy affair played in dreadful conditions.But McPake expects his team to be more like themselves on their own patch.“Saturday was a dficult day for football and there wasn’t much football played,” said the Dundee boss.“But given that we conceded a penalty, I thought we showed real character.“I’m disappointed to have not come away with the three points. We’re never happy with a point.“Against Alloa last week we created loads of chances and weren’t happy with a point for that reason.“But Saturday was a dferent game – we showed real character and a real desire not to concede.“We did that successfully, but going forward we weren’t as good.“A bit of that was down to the conditions and a bit was down to the way the game was played – but we’ll be better tomorrow night.” vw, px\"  Dundee were nowhere near as fluid in an attacking sense at Somerset Park as they were against Alloa at Dens last week.Nevertheless, they showed plenty of heart – and their -- shape again gave them a solidity in defence.The point they gained on Saturday ensured they stayed on Ayr’s tail – and allowed them to close the gap on second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle.Now the Dark Blues manager wants his side to really put the squeeze on.“I hope the surface at Dens will make a dference,” he said.“I’m not being critical of the surface at Ayr, because there was a game played there a few nights before and there was a lot of rain on Saturday.“It was dficult for both teams and that was evident in the way the game was played.“I don’t think we saw much of the quality that either team have shown so far this season.“We’ve been better in the previous games than we were on Saturday – and they have been, too. There wasn’t much football played but we showed real character and real desire to get a fourth clean sheet in a row.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee finding form as united stutter on title march","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, Sean Hamilton and Graeme Finnan dissect Dundee’s recent upturn in fortunes, discuss what United need to do to get their title march back on course and Billy Gilmour – is he good enough to be capped Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-nina-simone-put-spell-glasgow-90s-gigs","story":"FANS of Nina Simone will recall her two, glorious appearances in Glasgow in the s."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"mystery-author-glasgow-shipbuilders-poem","story":"WHILE clearing out her late fatherrsquos home, Rachel Willis discovered a yellowing, slightly tattered piece of paper, lovingly preserved in his belongings."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-university-graduate-became-uks-first-female-lawyer","story":" Madge Easton Anderson is one of six trailblazing women from Scotlandrsquos past to have been recognised with a Historic Environment ScotlandCommemorative Plaque this month.

However, McInnes insists the Reds were not calling for Whittaker to be dismissed.McInnes said: “It was a huge moment when Whittaker was sent off.“We are not looking to get Whittaker sent off.“He stands over the ball to stop us and kicks it away.“We had Dean Campbell sent off here two weeks ago with something similar. vw, px\"  “Dean was on a yellow card and did the same, with a dferent referee.“John Beaton dealt with that situation the way referees should deal with it.“We don’t want people sent off for that.

From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

Based on a hillside, looking down towards Kilchurn Castle, the Tigh Mor project has been developed over several years and has included many volunteers, including primary school pupils.The project has shown evidence of rural le in the th and th-centuries and has clearly demonstrated how archaeology can bring people of all ages together to help develop a site and create a wider interest in their local heritage.The next meeting will be held at .pm on Tuesday March , in the Nicoll Hall.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

We also take a look at what farming is doing to tackle climate change – the issue of the decade.#We were delighted to work alongside NFUS to produce these episodes of OnFARM. Podcasting is a superb way to get key messages across in a way that is enjoyable to listen to and yet informative at the same time. Podcast listenership is rising at an incredible rate and a tractor cab or lambing shed are perfect places to listen!

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"pedal power at macpool","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt was with trepidation I arrived at Mid Argyll Community Poolahead of the aqua bike try-out session [writes Rachel Carruthers].Exercise classes and I don#t often seem like a natural fit but I was excited to give the new craze a go.Aqua cycling uses stationary bikes immersed in a swimming pool, with water up to participants# waists, making it a non-weight bearing exercise.Aqua bikes can be used at all abilities and are often used in high intensity classes, giving a vigorous cardiovascular workout in a low impact environment # an ideal way to reduce obesity and prevent ill health.Stationary cycling and water-based exercises are also frequently recommended for patients suffering with osteoarthritis or recovering from knee and hip surgery or injury, therefore combining both is an obvious step.MACPool successfully applied for funding through the Argyll and Bute HSCP Self Management Fund to run the All Ability Cycling Project in partnership with Cycling UK and the Ardrishaig Bothy. As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

American.And although some may only know the titular song, Anything Goes, audiences are bound to fall in love with the equally tuneful I Get a Kick Out of You and Blow, Gabriel, Blow.If the classic showtunes werent enough to whet your theatre appetite, the amazing cast of this production will certainly capture your attention.Donning the flapper style, each cast member brings their own flair to their roles.Anything Goes star-crossed lovers, Hope Harcourt and Billy Crocker, played by Catriona Lamb and Jack McAuley show that even when apart, their characters determination to be together couldnt be stopped by those who would stand in their way. Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

But its location- Shawlands, Glasgow- and itrsquos cooking- not derivative, surprising- now those nuggets of information I will retain for future reference. And visually, perhaps its blueness: indigo lighting that makes a feature of the bar, those azure blue tiles bathed in turquoise light, and the leggy bar chairs all stop the interior looking humdrum.The menu here wakes up my jaded palate. So often you read a menu once, find nothing much that you fancy, then scrutinise it again, trying to make the best of a bad job. Not here. Actually therersquos competition dishes vie with one another. Fortunately itrsquos a small plates selection, so we are not too conflicted.We dip into a luxuriant chicken liver pateacute, puce pink and stf like thick whipped cream with just an undertone of sweet alcohol. It comes with toasted chunks of creditable sourdough from nearby Deanston bakery and its weight again in lsquotodayrsquos butterrsquo- with Spanish morcillaand crisp bacon beaten into it- which impregnates it with a smoky minerality. Alongside comes sweetly piquant pickled chilli, shallot, carrot, celery, and samphire. This assembly would make a nice lunch on its own, and itrsquos a steal for pound. Meanwhile, three little slow-cooked, golden-crusted beef nuggets strike a pose on their glass plate. Their rich veal jus glimmers as does the liquorice-black pool of sticky-sweet fermented black garlic aioli. Inside this delicate crust the meat comes away in tender shreds.: Zinfandel Gastro Bar, Nithsdale Road, Glasgow. Restaurant review by Ron MackennaAngularly cut caullower, roasted to just the right point where itrsquos definitely cooked, but not mushy, is distinguished from some wannabe Ottolenghi effort by its flavour-loaded smoked cheese velouteacute. A smidgen of date jam, a quivering confit egg yolk also make the brassica more unctuous, while a snowfall of crispy fried onions adds contrasting texture. How good is this lamb rump  Maybe at this time of year it almost qualies as hogget, meat from older, more mature sheep. Certainly its intrinsic flavour is there in force, and itrsquos so pink and dreamily tender. A star in and of itself, the lamb comes with salt-baked beetroot that taste exceptionally of themselves, amber-crusted potatoes- in a sort of pommes Anna treatment, only made with duck fat rather than butter- with smoked whipped feta, and a judicious amount of black olive crumb layering on salty savouriness. A phenomenal plateful for pound, substantial enough to be a main course, and given the high cost of lamb, a definite bargain.lsquoGelrsquo  That words usually worries me, but this pearly cod in its IPA batter that comes with a lemon rendition converts me to the G word itrsquos strikingly right with the deep-fried fish. Heap on this Jalapeno rf on tartare sauce, and celeriac remoulade, Irsquom drooling. This line-up doesnrsquot need its bao bun presentation. I ignore said bun. Parsnips  This treatment is innovative- golden with turmeric and honey, but I search for, and donrsquot find the promised presence of curry leaves.Itrsquos the same with the warm coconut rice pudding, which comes with roasted pineapple carpaccio, and coconut ice cream. What happened to the lsquolychee gelrsquo  So subtle I missed it  And these lsquoCrunchiersquo waffles with near molten honeycomb under them, topped with dark chocolate ganache, honeycomb ice cream, and a honey and lavender sauce, are galumphing. The ganache would make great truffles, the rest is OTT sweet and stodgy, but hearty eaters will doubtless lap them up.Overall though, the Dapper Duck, or whatever this place is called, isnrsquot playing safe in the suburbs.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake. If you chose to count the rings yoursquod see how many years had gone into making a blaze that lasts only a few hours."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Alex Salmond     the trial that could split the SNP from top to bottom","story":"Tomorrow, in Edinburghrsquos High Court, Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland, will go on trial accused of  criminal charges including attempted rape, sexual assault and harassment.Journalists ndash and the political world ndash have been talking of little  for months.It would, of course, be illegal to report any rumours or the identity of the claimants. The accusers in sexual assault and rape trials have anonymity.Journalists or editors who disclose any information that could prejudice a criminal trial, or make comments likely to influence jurors, could be guilty of contempt of court, and end up in jail.Already, one pro-SNP commentator, the former British diplomat Craig Murray, has been warned by the Crown Office that a satirical post he published in January could be ldquogravely in contempt.So, no satire or speculation from me. I make no comment about Mr Salmondrsquos guilt or innocence. Irsquoll just say that these are serious charges, potentially carrying long prison sentences.And that the Crown Office has released a lot of detail already.The indictment alleges that Mr Salmond attempted to rape a woman in his official residence in Bute House in June . He is said to have pinned her against a wall, to have removed her clothes and his own, before pushing her on to a bed and lying naked on top of her.In December , he is alleged to have caused a woman to lie on his bed, struggled with her and pulled up her dress.Other charges include an allegation he groped a woman in the Ego nightclub in Edinburgh in or around , and to have removed a womanrsquos shoe in  and tried to kiss her foot.Mr Salmond insists that he is innocent of all criminal charges.Like any defendant, the former First Minister has the presumption of innocence on his side. His guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.This trial ndash of one of the leading Scottish politicians of the age ndash will have huge political reverberations. It comes at a crucial moment for the SNP and the nationalist movement.Salmondrsquos prosecution intersects with growing isions over the future direction of the independence campaign. It could also affect Nicolarsquos Surgeonrsquos future as leader.There is a parliamentary inquiry into what the First Minister knew about the allegations about her mentor, and when she knew them. She has admitted that she held a number of private meetings with Salmond about the allegations without informing her civil servants.More seriously, this trial breaks just as increasing numbers of SNP activists are despairing of the prospects for a second independence referendum. Sturgeon keeps promising to deliver indyref, but it never arrives.Many frustrated nationalists believe thatAlex Salmond had still been leading the party, there would have been a referendum of some sort by now. They believe Sturgeon is too small lsquocrsquo conservative. Too insistent on a strictly legal route to independence.Salmond ndash and I state this not as a character reference ndash was one of the most successful populist politicians Britain has ever produced. An insurgent with a unique gt for communicating with Scottish voters of all backgrounds, he always led from the front.In , after he became leader of the SNP, he pulled the party to the left and made ldquoIndependence in Europe the partyrsquos mission statement. Then, in the mid-s, he defeated the fundamentalists in the party and persuaded the SNP to support devolution.Labour Politicians like the Cabinet minister, George Robertson, said that the Scottish Parliament, inaugurated in , would ldquokill nationalism stone dead. It did precisely the reverse.In , Alex Salmond declared himself First Minister of the first SNP Government in history. Then,in , he led the SNP to a landslide election victory and demanded a referendum on independence.At the time, independence was much less popular than the SNP. This was why the then-prime minister, David Cameron, agreed to a referendum in the first place thinking he couldnrsquot lose. In the event, the Yes campaign came within % of winning the  referendum, plunging the UK state into panic.With that track record, it is hardly surprising that many nationalists see Salmond as a politicianwho can literally do no wrong and refuse to believe the charges against him.Two years ago, before the sexual misconduct allegations first arose, Salmond had been making clear he intended toto active politics, following his retirement in . He even suggested he would be one of the leaders of the next independence referendum campaign. Not everyone in the party thought this would be a good thing.At no time did he challenge Nicola Sturgeonrsquos leadership ndash she was, after all, his protege and worked intimately with him for over a decade in the Scottish Government. But Salmond was known to be looking for a safe route back into Parliament.Then in August of that year a story was leaked to the Daily Record that two civil servants had made complaints of sexual misconduct by Alex Salmond in . Salmond rejected the allegations and in turn accused the head of the Scottish Civil Service, Lesley Evans, of misconduct.He took the Scottish Government to the Court of Session and won in January . The Scottish Government admitted fault and ended up paying Alex Salmond pound, of taxpayersrsquo money.

My decision to vote SNP would depend upon the Scottish Government at least having published a convincing White Paper explaining how the economy of an independent Scotland would . I am not entirely convinced that will prove possible and to claim, as the Yes SNP campaign did in , that everything would work out for the best solely as a consequence of being independent would be totally insufficient.This is the dference between hard-core nationalists for whom independence is an end in itself and those of us who seek to be convinced.May I take this opportunity to confirm Mr Martinrsquos suspicions. I shall never accept the outcome of the  gerrymandered referendum.John Milne, Uddingston.ALLAN Thompsontakes me to task for the politics of grievance. However, I think he fails to appreciate, or chooses not to, the full implications of my argument.Mr Thompsonrsquos argument is based on the frequent argument that where in the UK does better out of the government than Scotland does, they get this but we donrsquot, things are better down there and we are left behind and so on.In contrast my argument is not based on what has happened, but rather going forward, on the direction of travel of policy development in Edinburgh and London. That the latter, in terms of its NHS development, appears to be heading toward privatised medicine, while the former is more influenced by Scandinavian policy of high-quality services based on a higher level of taxation. In other words, it is not about where policy and practice are now, but where they might be in  or  years, and in particular whether that degree of iance is manageable within the current Union, economically or politically.Nor, Mr Thomson might do well to remember, was this my observation, but said in reply to a question about the ldquoshocking degree of health inequalities in England. The source was Danny Dorling, Professor of Social Geography at the University of Oxford. I rather suspect it would be dficult to realistically categorise ProfDorling as a grievance-ridden Nat.Moreover, Mr Thomson may consider this observation a ldquoisive wedge, but Prof Dorlingrsquos work shows that infant mortality in England has risen since , but fallen in Scotland. The policy dferences are therefore real, but more than this, validated by the electorate at successive elections.Lastly, in response to Mr Thomsonrsquos question of what we have in common with Latvia or Estonia, the answer I suppose is ldquonot that much. On the other hand, no one is suggesting that we enter into the sort of all-embracing union with these countries that we have had with England for the last  years.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE question has to be asked: does the entire political class hate small business The Scottish Finance Secretary has announced a near- per cent rise in business rates between the coming tax year starting next month and the year  . That averages out to a rise of more than seven per cent per year.At the same time, as a result of the coronavirus and the reaction to its spread, this year there is likely to be an economic downturn.These rises are dumped on small businesses by well-remunerated politicians, who donrsquot have to worry about making a profit in order to pay their own bills.Otto Inglis, Edinburgh EH.DR RM Morrisfails to point out that,Kate Forbes adopts the recommendation from the CEO of Scottish Power ndash published in The Herald last June ndash Herald of June  that \"renewable energy is too expensive for consumers hence the cost must be transferred to the taxpayer\", then the use of such energy, free at the point of use, will increase dramatically.

A four-fold increase on renewables to charge electric vehicles plus replacing energy for gas boilers means that over the summer, when heating demand is low, the excess capacity will swamp the current interconnectors, resulting in multi billion pound constraint payments ndash all costs to be met by the long-suffering taxpayer.Dr Morris et al need to recognise that Scotland cannot afford the demise of the UK grid and the  per cent subsidy from English consumers.Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.Read more: Jack admits there are lsquodficultiesrsquo on immigration"},{"url":null,"title":"olympic-champion-skippers-bid-make-uk-world-leader-eco-friendly-ferries","story":"Sailing champion Iain Percy is combining his own know-how from designing Americas Cup racing yachts with expertise from the maritime, aerospace and F racing industries to develop what he calls a \"plane underwater\".Southampton-born Percy, , has chosen Belfast - a city with a rich ship and aircraft building heritage - as the location for the eco-friendly hydrofoil technology.His consortium - which includes leading manufacturers such as Bombardier UK and universities and local councils in Northern Ireland - is currently vying for a pound million Government grant to part-fund a pound million research and development project.The green-energy ferries will use the same hydrofoil technology that has transformed Americas Cup sailing in the last decade.The boat will have hydrofoil \"wings\" under the surface of the water that are attached to the hull with vertical struts.Much like a plane taking off on a runway, the wings drive the hull up and out of the water as the vessel picks up speed.That enables the craft to travel with its entire hull, bar the wing struts, raised above the waves - thus reducing drag, and fuel costs, by a dramatic %.With signicantly less energy required to cut through the water, the ferries no longer need the power of traditional diesel engines, and can instead operate with small electric motors similar to those used in Formula E racing cars.Percy said the aim is to generate that electricity from renewable sources, thus creating a zero-emissions craft.The hydrofoils can also be retro-fitted to existing ferries to transform their energy use.Percy said: \"Think of a boat sitting on top of an aeroplane is the best way to describe it.\"We all know that when we are sitting on a plane and we go down the runway, eventually a combination of going faster and the wings having their flaps down, the plane eventually takes off.\"Its no dferent than that underwater, only water is a lot denser than air - , times denser - so the wings themselves are a lot smaller.\"Percy is the chief executive of Artemis Technologies, a spin-off of the Americas Cup team, Artemis Racing.He won sailing gold at the  Sydney and  Beijing Olympics - on the second occasion alongside le-long friend Andrew Simpson, who later died in a tragic sailing accident in the United States in .Artemis is leading the Belfast Maritime Consortium - a group that includes Belfast and Ards and North Down councils, Belfast Harbour, Queens University, Ulster University, Belfast politan College, Bombardier UK, Catalyst, Creative Composites, Energia, and the Northern Ireland Advanced Composites and Engineering Centre .With Bombardiers hi-tech wing-manufacturing plant sitting adjacent to Belfasts expansive shipyards, Percy said the city is the perfect location for a business that combined both industries.\"We are effectively a wing in the water, so were a perfect marriage of those two industries and Belfast is uniquely placed to really world lead in whats going to be a new transformative technology,\" he said.\"This is a real transformative technology and because of that the growth can be huge.\"We believe that from here in Belfast there can be a huge export-led business that can make a real dference to emissions globally.\"The consortium is through to the final round of a competitive process to secure support through the Governments new Strength In Places innovation fund.It is the only Northern Ireland bid still in the mix for a grant and the only maritime-focused project.Unlike several of the other bids, the consortium is also underpinned by a signicant financial commitment - pound million - from its commercial members.Percy, who was made an OBE in , said he hopes for a positive result when the final Strength In Places awards are announced in the coming weeks.He admits he has had a \"funny path\" from the Olympic podium to the design studio.\"I started as a sailor competing in multiple Olympics and Americas Cups but slowly migrated more to the technical side of our sport,\" he said.\"One of the great things about the Americas Cup is not only is it a sporting challenge its very much a design and engineering challenge as well, so, through leading Americas Cup teams, I became more involved in the office maybe than on the water in my older age.\"But that has naturally led on to a passion for zero-emissions travel.\"Sailing has been zero-emissions and transporting our goods for thousands of years, so to be able toto zero-emissions maritime transportation is something that I am very passionate about and it was a natural next step.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11130420.jpg?type=article-full","title":"femfoods-programme-teach-low-income-woman-batch-cook","story":"She knows, through personal experience, that confidence leads to increased mental and physical wellbeing, which then leads to better outcomes for families.Since , Ms Douglas has worked with women from Glasgow to ldquosupport female empowerment through her community interest company, MsMissMrs, which helped more than  women last year access workshops in health, wellbeing and self-care.:Camera club challenges dementia stereotypes and boosts confidenceNow she has added a new arm to her already thriving social enterprise ndash a purpose-built kitchen facility in the north of Glasgow where long-time friend and chef Fiona Mackenzie will teach women on low incomes how to batch cook, budget and save.The Femfoods programme will run six-week courses where women commit to saving half the money they would usually spend on food and contribute pound each week towards the cost of fresh ingredients they will cook on site before taking home to fill their freezers and feed their families.Ms Douglas said: ldquoLots of people are talking about child poverty but itrsquos a family issue and it brings so much shame. ldquoTherersquos a real stigma and lots of women who might need to access support will be too frightened to.

Spring wrote his novel in the s and never witnessed the Scottish political scene of , but sometimes it reads like he did.One of the moments that particularly jumped out for me when I read the book recently was towards the end of Shawcrossrsquos career when he is considering the nature of politics. A colleague asks him what the main qualications for success are in a politician and he boils it down to three things. ldquoThe politician must be an expert at appealing to panic, passion and prejudice, he says. ldquoWhen these do not exist, he must know how to create them at the right moment.Now, that might sound a bit cynical to some people, but those three Ps ndash panic, passion and prejudice ndash have contributed to creating the current climate in Scotland. Both sides, unionist and nationalist, have used thembut acknowledging them and talking about them could help us get out the other side. Letrsquos go through the three Ps one by one.The first one, panic, is one we should all recognise, particularly in the week idiots have been stripping toilet roll from the supermarket shelves. Hamer Shawcross said the trick of an effective politician was to make people panic about a disease and persuade them theyrsquore going to die unless they take the partyrsquos medicine. In other words, the idea is to create a political coronavirus and tell the voters only you have the masks and the hand sanitiser.The SNP has been particularly effective at this. In , they told us we had to vote Yes or Scotlandrsquos NHS would be privatised, and in  the First Minister said there was a risk of powers being taken away from Holyrood. None of it was true and all of it was panic and the word written on the panic button was ldquoTories.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Latest updates as world tackles global epidemicThe other side do it too. In , prominent unionists told us Scottish independence would lead to economic chaos and even a threat to world securityScotland got rid of Trident, but again, it was panic and the word written on the panic button this time was ldquoNats. On the flip side, there were also wild promisesbut the best approach, instead of panic or promises, would be pragmatism. No-one is trying to crush or remove Scottish identity, and independence would not lead to an Irwin Allen disaster movie, so both sides should stop talking like those things are true.The second P is passion, and itrsquos a word SNP politicians in particular love. Theyrsquore passionate about Scotland, and about standing up for Scotland, and the implication is that anyone who doesnrsquot agree is not passionate about Scotland, a.k.a. not a true Scot. But we know, donrsquot we, that passion can and does lead to anger, and we know anger is even easier to exploit but harder to control.This is another of the lessons of Howard Springrsquos novel. Some people have seen the book as a condemnation of Labour PM Ramsay MacDonald, but itrsquos much more subtle than that. Hamer Shawcross boils with passion as a young man but comes to realise change in Britain usually comes not with a great, passionate sweep of a sword but by infinite slow, organic degrees. He says we will not ldquostream magnicently to heaven on the tail of a fiery bloody rocket.It is the dreams of the fiery bloody rocket that the SNP needs to resist and control and there are signs in the more sensible parts of the party that they get it. Recently, the First Minister said proponents of independence need to make the case with passion but also with patience, and Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission was part of an effort to temper the passion with common sense. ldquoThe reality, said Wilson, ldquois change of such signicance hellip is a process rather than an event. No fiery rockets.Which takes us to the third, final, and possibly most controversial P: prejudice. Again, both sides of the constitutional ide are guilty of it, but I think the SNP in particular hasnrsquot quite worked out how to deal with the problem. Itrsquos asthey know they have to condemn it, but also know ndash as Hamer Shawcross did ndash that prejudice is one of the weapons at a politicianrsquos disposal.What I suppose Irsquom saying is the majority of SNP members and supporters are not prejudiced against the English, but some are because Irsquove heard it myself. Irsquove heard people say there are too many English in such-and-such a place or that we are ldquocolonised by the English and so forth. Itrsquos also logical thatyoursquore prejudiced against the English, yoursquore going to vote for the SNP.What the leadership of the party needs to work out is how to handle this prejudice and theyrsquore conflicted. On the one hand, as soon as anyone whips out an inappropriate banner ndash ldquoEnglish go home or whatever ndash the leadership condemn it. But what theyrsquore not ready to accept is that nationalism itself attracts people who hate or distrust other nationalities. Why seek to overly control those who are guilty of prejudice when prejudice is one of the emotions you can appeal to :Mark Smith: How to sell Scottish independence to people like meThe answer is to recognise that - powerful as they are - prejudice, panic and passion only take you so far, and that to progress further, nationalists need to heed the advice of another great novelist John Buchan. It was Buchan who warned against ldquoarticial nationalism that relies on dferences and instead promoted ldquosane nationalism based on whatrsquos economically good for the nation, and in Scottish terms, this could mean more independence than we have but not as much independence as many nationalists want. Why not put that case to Scotland  Why not put it calmly, and without prejudice or panic  People would listen."},{"url":null,"title":"seas-ing-day-women-hundreds-take-dip-international-womens-day","story":"Swimrise was inspired by the International Womenrsquos Day swim organised in  by body positivity ambassador Danni Gordon and Anna Deacon, author of wild swimming book, Taking The Plunge.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is shocking and it is time that we call it for what it is.”Summing up at the end of the debate, the minister for digital infrastructure, Matt Warman MP, said: #The UK has been vocal in drawing attention to the systematic violation of human rights of Uighur Muslims.

Following discussions with the OIC Economic Development department, we decided to hold the seminar and networking event just after the Business Festival to give an informative seminar for local businesses who are interested in the global market.“Mr Yukita will talk about Japan and UK relations, the Japanese economy, structural reform, business opportunities and tips for doing business with Japan.“We also invited local businessmen Stephen Kemp, who recently went to Japan to explore the Japanese market, and Gareth Davies, from Aquatera, to be guest speakers and ists.

We’re aware that time is precious and scarce for business owners, but hopefully there’s something during this week that’s worth investing their time in – butthey can’t, it’s reassuring to know that local support from the likes of Business Gateway and OJA is always available.”For more information, you can contact OJAinfo@btinternetcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Youth team Strom-West also offers a pathway for young girls to develop to senior football.Kirsty Brown, who plays for Kirkwall City, explained: “Women’s football in Orkney, over the last couple of years, has taken a massive step.“We’ve seen the development of Kirkwall City, in addition to Orkney Women’s Football Club, and the logical step now is try and come together, get as strong as we possibly can, and to get inter-county and Island Games going.“ is a massive step ahead of us. It’s not that long away, so we definitely need to work together and see what we can do.“There’s fantastic players in both sides. It’s great that we’ve got two clubs. It’s completely needed for the number of players in Orkney. Both teams are in the Highlands and Islands League this year, playing  matches each.“That’s a massive opportunity for the girls and women in Orkney to play competitively, but the association will bring these two teams together and form an even stronger squad who can play on an inter-county level.“The meeting itself is an initial AGM. We would really like to be in a position where we could form a committee, officially start the association, and move forward in the best way possible for the future of football.”Developing Orkney as a county squad and an Island Games regular will take time, effort and commitment.Like many sports, women’s football is now putting the building blocks in place for a successful Games in , but early discussions are taking place in regards to sending a side to the  Games in Guernsey.Nicola Croy, who plays her football for Orkney Women’s, said: “The  Games will be an eye-opener. There’s a lot of great teams out there, so it will show Orkney how much we need to come together as an Island Games team and prepare ourselves for our home  Games.“Once this committee is set up, we can start with developing the county and Island Games team.”Among the positions to fill will be coach of the new county side, tasked with guiding the development of the team and leading the team to success.And in a bid to expand the playing pool even further, women who may not be playing league football currently are still encouraged to attend the meeting in April.Brown added: “There is a magnitude of abilities out there in Orkney and they’re maybe not playing.“Anybody that wants to get involved in any way, come along on April . It’s a fantastic opportunity for girls and Orkney in general.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

Perhaps your best bet would be an uninhabited island out of touch with humanity, that might at least stop your ignorant and alarmist nonsense.It is interesting to note that, most likely, nobody had ever known or learned of the Corona Virus up until a few months ago. What is the source of this virus, how did it manage to spread so quickly, what medical evidence is there in terms of its origins and history, is it a new form of virus or has it been manufactured in a laboratory as part and parcel of biological warfare  In other words, it is not natural within nature itself  It seems evident in recent times, the amount of scare mongering there is about certain illnesses, diseases and or viruses becoming more evident through the media. Who gains from such publicity and what other motives are there for the future about unknown or predicted outcomes from the WHO or governments  It will be interesting to note such public announcements in the future regarding health, immune system and unknown epidemics suddenly appearing and putting fear into the population for someones hidden agenda of making the quick buck scenario    .."},{"url":null,"title":"vacancies at shetland arts ","story":"Are you friendly, outgoing and good with people  Do you have a passion for great food and drink Shetland Arts are seeking a casual weekend Café Assistant for Bonhoga Gallery.There will also be the opportunity to pick up some short shts at Mareel from pm # pm Monday # Friday.Shetland Arts are looking to expand our team of retail assistants!

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day .

It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages.

Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions.

It is understood the Queen and other senior royals were following the protocol the Abbey has been operating under during the past few days.Harry and Meghan arrived looking relaxed after a hectic past few days which have seen them attend a string of public events. Their goodbye tour has included the Endeavour Fund Awards, a military musical festival at the Royal Albert Hall and Meghan#s secret visit to a school in Dagenham, east London, to celebrate International Women#s Day. The couple do not officially step down from their roles as working members of the royal family until March , but the service - broadcast around the globe on the BBC World Service - was the symbolic end of their le supporting the Queen.Meghan was in a green Emilia Wickstead dress with asymmetrical cape and hat by William Chambers. Kate was in red, wearing a coat by Catherine Walker and a hat by Sally-Ann Provan. In a change from last year#s event the Sussexes were shown to their seats and did not wait at the Abbey#s great west door to meet the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Queen before processing with the other royals at the start of the ceremony.The move is likely to be interpreted by commentators as their impending exit from #The Firm# - dubbed Megxit - although the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, unlike last year, will also take their place in the ,-strong congregation and not the procession through the Abbey. When Meghan and Harry first arrived they were greeted by the Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle, and met a group of dignitaries including Boris Johnson and the Commonwealth#s secretary-general Baroness Scotland.Belfast Related ContentGalleryRepublic of IrelandMusic in the pub and a crash course in GAA skills as royals charm GalwayIt was third time lucky for the Duchess of Cambridge who - after two  dawns - pucked a goal to make Irish hurling legend DJ Carey proud. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bda-dd-f-b-fbdfdb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bda-dd-f-b-fbdfdb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bda-dd-f-b-fbdfdb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bda-dd-f-b-fbdfdb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bda-dd-f-b-fbdfdb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKKate and William try their hand at Gaelic football and hurling in GalwayThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed the thrills and spills of traditional Irish sports as they joined a group of youngsters on the pitch.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Belfast restaurant closes as a #precautionary measure# Tributes to bike ace Philip Wylie who died in hospital three weeks after Nutts Corner crashFemale cyclist airlted to hospital after collision with carCoronavirus: Northern Ireland football club confirms player tested positive after Saturday fixtureBelfast councillor resigns from DUP citing #blatant attempt to cause him harm#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Belfast restaurant closes as a #precautionary measure# Tributes to bike ace Philip Wylie who died in hospital three weeks after Nutts Corner crashFemale cyclist airlted to hospital after collision with carDUP#s Arlene Foster attends Commonwealth service in Harry and Meghan#s final official engagement Belfast councillor resigns from DUP citing #blatant attempt to cause him harm#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Derry village was devastated by flooding in August  when flash flooding struck the North West. Around  families were displaced from their homes which had an “enormous emotional impact” on the local community. Fears have resurfaced following recent storms when some homes had to be sandbagged. In the aftermath residents were promised greater protection from such an event in future through flood mitigation. Consulting Engineers were commissioned to carry out Feasibility Studies to assess the flood risk to properties in the Drumahoe, Eglinton and Derry City areas. googletag.cmd.push The purpose of these studies was to investigate a range of options in order to determinethere were any economically viable flood alleviation measures which would reduce the impacts of flooding. Several options have been considered, including the provision of flood defences such as walls and embankments and the upsizing of culverts. A combination of these measures were deemed most suitable. In answer to an Assembly question from party colleague Mark H Durkan, SDLP Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, provided an update on the flood mitigation measures currently being proposed as a result of the Eglinton feasibility study. She commented: “The feasibility study for Eglinton has recently been completed. The scheme involves the construction of approximately , metres of flood defences and a range of other smaller works. googletag.cmd.push “The next stage is to test the proposals from a value for money and deliverability perspective and this work is now in hand. I am keen that it is brought to a swt conclusion and hope to be able to provide a further update on the timing for this important scheme in the near future.” Debbie Caulfield, Manager at Eglinton Community Centre, said residents would like to see a more urgency from the minister and her department. She said: “The public meeting last year when DfI Rivers and AECOM presented the draft scheme was extremely well attended - about  people turned up for that meeting. There were many questions asked, opinions given and I had the general impression that it would be welcomed. “There were of course details of land ownership, agreements etc to be resolved and I do not know how far advanced those are, but they have had nearly  months to work on that. “Recent storms have been a bit stressful and a few houses had to be sandbagged. We do however have community resilience and volunteers willing to help.” She added that flooding in recent weeks around the houses in Granchester Park was not caused by rainwater but by people putting baby wipes down toilets which resulted in sewage surfacing around the houses. “The two pumps had to be cleared and cleaned - now for me this is an example of people not taking responsibility for their own behaviour - after all how many times do we all have to be told not to put anything but toilet paper into the sewers - and the additional cost to public finances of this. “My message to the minister would be that civil servants were clear last June that this scheme was viable and costed and needed to happen - my understanding was that the value for money aspect had already been considered in the feasibility study carried out by AECOM for DfI Rivers - but I may have taken them up wrong. The minister should get on with it,” Ms Caulfield concluded.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ with the decision and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

We’re delighted with him and with the whole team, said John McEvoy after the game. Despite winning all of their four other league games, Derry went into the match knowing they had to avoid defeatthey wanted to reach the showpiece, given their inferior points dference to both Kildare and Down. googletag.cmd.push Our sport coverage is brought to you in association with TJ Hamilton Cookstown The first half was a tale of two marksmen as Jack Sheridan and Cormac O’Doherty dominated the scoring charts. Despite playing into the wind it was Kildare who were largely in control until the th minute when Ross Kelly was dismissed for an off-the-ball hit on Meehaul McGrath. In the second half, Sean Cassidy won his battle with Sheridan – with the added protection of sweeper McGrath – to quell the threat, but each time the Oakleafers looked to pull away, their resilient opponents came back. In fact, Sheridan thought he had booked the visitors’ place in the final with a late free, but with just seconds remaining Conor Kelly was the coolest and bravest man in Celtic Park to score the biggest point of Derry’s season so far. googletag.cmd.push DERRY: Sean Kelly, Paddy Kelly, Sean Cassidy, Darragh Cartin, Seaacuten Oacute Caiside, Brian Oacuteg McGilligan, Conor Kelly , Paul Cleary , Meehaul McGrath, Jerome McGuigan, Cormac O’Doherty , Thomas Brady, Eoghan Cassidy , Seacute McGuigan , Richie Mullan.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes for SDLP Derry Councillor Mary Durkan who is urging the public to support university workers as they enter their final phase of staggered strike action this week, organised by the University and College Union . Cllr Durkan said: “We stand in solidarity with all university workers on strike at Ulster University, Queen’s University and where. “University lecturers are enduring the stresses of signicant de facto pay cuts with a simultaneous expansion in workload. “Better working conditions for staff equates with better learning conditions and an all-round better university experience. If we are to truly value the role of universities, then the devaluation of staff must be properly addressed. googletag.cmd.push “The issues in dispute are all adversely impacting on our quality of higher education: devaluation in pay, gender pay gap, an increase in casual contracts, unsustainable workloads and changes to staff pensions.” Cllr Durkan concluded: “Let’s hope that negotiations between management and UCU are productive so that resolution to these issues can be found soon.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Edwardstone has won two of his three starts over hurdles and would have beaten Stolen Silver last time out had he not hung left on the run-in on appalling ground. Hes seen to best effect on soft or good to soft and will benefit from a strong pace. The Supreme is often run at a frantic pace and that will play to his strengths. Hell be held up in fourth or fth and could be staying on strongest up the hill. With bookmakers paying four and five places on the eachway market, this horse is tremendous value. googletag.cmd.push : - FAKIR DOUDARIES  - Course form is important at Cheltenham and thats why Fakir DOudaries, fourth in last years Supreme Novice Hurdle, is getting the nod here. This race has been won by an Irish-trained horse in four of the last five years and we again dominate the market with Fakir DOudaries and Notebook of Henry De Bromheads yard. Fakir DOudaries lost to that rival last time out but connections have admitted tactics were wrong that day. He also found himself short of room up the inside and was forced out. Nonetheless, he was only beaten a little over aby Notebook. He saw out the hill well last year after a fast-run Supreme and is a Grade  winner over fences thanks to an incredible - win in the Drinmore at Fairyhouse in December. This horse jumps well and will be ridden patiently for a strong finish. Expect him to be right in the frame as they hit the last. googletag.cmd.push : - DISCORAMA  - Continuing the trend of course form being king at Cheltenham, this horse could be one of the best-handicapped of the week. Paul Nolan is a somewhat forgotten man in Irish racing but he has his string in good form and could land a couple of winners this week. This lad could be one of them, despite losing his last two races by a cumulative  s. He has had a wind operation since then and also has some serious form in the book. Looking at Cheltenham, he was second in the Martin Pipe in  and looked all over the winner of the four-miler last year before given way to Le Breuil at the line. He has shaped as a proper staying chaser without really taking flight. He hasnt won a chase race since his first over fences at Naas back in November , but dont hold that against him either. He was second to Delta Work, relegating Ryanair Chase favourite A Plus Tard to third in a Grade  at Punchestown last April and was just the s down on many peoples idea of a winner this week, Champagne Classic, before his withdrawal. That run behind Delta Work is the best in the book andhe comes back to that form and laps up Cheltenham again, he could be powering up the hill in front come pm on Tuesday. : - DARVER STAR  - This would be somewhat of a fairytale for his Louth owners, but in a very open and relatively weak Champion Hurdle, this horse could outlast them all up the hill. While unlike a future champion winner, he picked up his first win in a handicap hurdle at Wexford in April last year after five unsuccessful trips to the track before that. He was rated  in that Wexford race but has had a meteoric rise since then. Hes won four times in the intervening period, including a listed race in Limerick last October, but it is his performances in defeat in graded company that catch the eye most of all. After his fourth win on the spin, he went up against Ballymore favourite Envoi Allen at Fairyhouse in December. He was a   outsider but admirably finished just four s behind Envoi Allen. That was good enough form but may have been written off as a flukeDarver Star didnt follow it up with something similar. He did just that and probably surpassed that display by running Honeysuckle very close at Leopardstown last month. He was slow enough to get into stride but after the last, he was gaining ground on Henry De Bromheads star and market principle in the Mares Hurdle all the way to the line. He was denied by half abut beat the likes of Petit Mouchoir and Supasundae in the process. : - STORMY IRELAND  - I accept that this race is a match between Benie Des Dieux and Honeysuckle but the former is   and while I think shell win, Im going to the place market. As evidenced last year when Benie Des Dieux fell at the last while streaking clear, anything can happen in racing. If one or both of the top two in the market misfire, Stormy Ireland is best placed to pick up the pieces. She was second in this race last year and is evidently a better horse this term. She was runner-up on two occasions leading into last years festival but has won three on the spin this winter. She won all three at her ease by a combined  s. Shell be staying better than most up the hill and could even spring a surprise on one of the big players. Ill be surprisedshes out of the first three home. : - LORD SCHNITZEL  - A race for an eachway bet so how about a   shot. Lord Schnitzel could land a shock here based off two decent runs in a form book littered with poor displays. He finished just three s behind Carefully Selected last November and finished ahead of the likes of Glenloe in a race won by Faugheen a couple of weeks earlier. This is his best trip ands while he deserves to be  , hes capable of putting in a performance on his day. At a shorter price, Espoir De Guyeis a rapid improver with a nice profile. : - LORD DU MESNIL  - This notorious slog has been shortened somewhat this year but you still need a horse that stays all day to tackle the Cheltenham hill after running three and a half miles. Having finished second in a Grand National trial at Haydock last time out, Lord Du Mesnil fits that bill superbly. He is a distance specialist and has a top jockey on board in Sam Whaley-Cohen. Before that National trial, Lord Du Mesnil beat decent yardstick Perfect Candidate by nine s. He has won three times this season, improving on each occasion. Carefully Selected is the big gamble of this race for Willie Mullins but is prone to a mistake, a trait which could cost him over this gruelling trip at Cheltenham.

Two early Cahir Higgins frees saw the Derry champions open up an early lead, but they were dealt a blow on  minutes when Conor Love reacted quickest to a breaking ball and fired low past Cahir Hasson to give Enniskillen the lead. Dungiven then suffered a double whammy. First they lost midfielder Daire McKeever to a red card for his part unsavoury post-goal exchanges, and then Cahir Higgins saw his penalty superbly turned around the post by Gaels goalkeeper Cian Newman. googletag.cmd.push Points from Richie Mullan and Fintan Murphy edged Dungiven in front before the break and Feargal Higgins opened it to two points at the beginning of the second half, but Enniskillen replied strongly. Fermanagh senior list Johnny Cassidy swung over a beauty in response and a th minute Eoin Beacom point levelled matters before Enniskillen took the lead. John Rehill burrowed his way along the touchline and squared for Paddy Cassidy to fist home in front of Cahir Hasson and open a three-point gap. Dungiven though were nonplussed and a brace of Richie Mullan frees either side of Cahir Higgins th minute free saw the deficit eradicated and with extra time looming, St Canices found a winner. googletag.cmd.push Feargal Higgins collected the ball in the full-forward line, held off his marker and squeezed over a right-footed effort on  minutes almost from the end line. Conor Kelly then fired over the insurance point on the stroke of the final whistle and ensured Dungiven’s progress to an intriguing semi-final meeting with St Eunan’s of Letterkenny.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners. A best kept garden competition is another idea.The town committee hopes to tie all the events into Down Councilrsquos anti-litter campaign later this year when a prize of pound will be awarded to the best kept town or village in the council area.Some members of the town committee, however, fear Killyleagh could get off to a bad start in the competition because of the major housing redevelopment schemes at Shore Street and Irish Street, and the overall shabby appearance of roads and footpaths in the area.DUNDRUM mdash Ambitious plans to make Dundrum Regatta and Sports bigger and better were drawn at the Regatta Committeersquos annual meeting in the Bay Inn on Monday night.Ideas to cater for teenagers, introduce a more ied programme and revert to a date in mid July were considered at the well attended meeting.Before the election of officers, which saw Mr Hugh Graham re-elected as chairman and Mr Pierce Rice appointed secretary, the committee congratulated Mr Dan McNeill for his -year association with the committee,  of which were spent as chairman.One of the more pleasing aspects to come out of the meeting was the formation of a group, to be known as the teenage committee, which will should out what teenagers want to see in the programme of events, this ensuring young, middle-aged and elderly will be catered for. The dates for this yearrsquos Regatta are July -.LOUGHINISLAND mdash Loughinisland hasnrsquot had a public phone kiosk since it was knocked down by a lorry three years ago.

The local development association say they have been conned mdash and  residents agree with them.The row relates to the possible side effects of the Department of the Environmentrsquos scheme to meet the townrsquos needs on whig work began last year and was abandoned a few months ago.For more than ten years there has been intense opposition to a sewerage collection tank located close to the townrsquos slipway.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies.

Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

I have been a guest speaker at some events, including a Sinn Fein meeting in the Mansion House in Dublin a couple of years ago, in which I argued that I couldn’t actually think of any way in which a united Ireland would accommodate my political constitutional identity, that very personal sense of who I am and what I believe. In other words, I am probably never going to be open to persuasion. Steve Aiken said last week that nobody from the UUP ‘not now, not ever’ would be involved in a conversation about a united Ireland \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...But, as I said to that particular audience – and others since then – persuading people of the merits of a united Ireland is clearly now part and parcel of the post-Brexit agenda and I can understand why Sinn Fein, Ireland’s Future and other elements of civic nationalism are so invested in the ‘unity project’.Personally, I don’t want to be part of that conversation. So asking me what ‘it would take’ to convince me of the merits of a united Ireland is a futile exercise. You may as well ask Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou McDonald to come to an audience of unionists and tell us what it would take to convince them to abandon their dreams and aspirations of A Nation Once Again. While it may be the case that there are some changes and reforms which would make Irish nationalists less uncomfortable with certain aspects of unionism and Britishness, I can’t imagine that there is anything which would make any member of Sinn Feinreach a point at which they would say: “That’s ok. We’ve no concerns anymore, so we’ll forget all about unity.” The other problem with the sort of ‘conversations’ which Sinn Fein and others want to have with unionism right now is my unshakeable feeling that they are predicated on a simple premise: Irish unity is now inevitable, you can’t stop it, political dynamics and electoral demographics are against you, the UK is falling apart and English nationalists don’t care about you so talk to us now and we’ll do our best to make you as comfortable as possible. Getting unionism into that conversation and on that premise would be regarded as a huge strategic and psychological victory for those who want a united Ireland as the only outcome. Anyway, how do you have such a conversation in advance of a border poll  What would the conclusion of the conversation be what influence would it have on the framing of a border poll question  As a unionist I want to remain part of the United Kingdom. I want unionism to make the case for the Union . To get involved in a pre-border poll debate with nationalism on the basis of what we would want a united Ireland to look like in the event of unionism being on the losing side of a border poll doesn’t make sense to me. And again, I can’t imagine that nationalism is going to set out a list of what would make it happy enough to remain in the United Kingdom. It is possible, of course, that a border poll could be called and unionism could be on the losing side. At that point there would have to be a debate and formal negotiations in which, as per the wording of the Belfast Agreement: ‘...the wish expressed by a majority ... is that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland, the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament such proposals to give effect to that wish as may be agreed between her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Ireland.’Unionism would be involved in that debate and negotiation , but crucially it wouldn’t just be a conversation between unionism and local nationalism. It would be a much bigger debate than that. It would probably also roll on for a few years. Also, it would not be possible for Sinn Fein or any other party or grouping involved in the sort of ‘conversation’ in which unionists are being encouraged to engage in now, to guarantee anything – not a single thing – in terms of what a united Ireland would look like. All of that lies in the hands of a future British and Irish government.Unionism should certainly, as I’ve argued for years, work on the basis that a border poll is possible and should be prepared for. But that preparation shouldn’t include formal conversations with those who want to muster a majority vote to end the Union and who want elements of unionism to assist them in that project. That’s why no unionist party can be, or will be, part of the conversation. But it does mean that party-political unionism, like Sinn Fein and other elements of nationalism, does need to secure and galvanise its core vote, as well as identying and reaching-out to small-u unionists and small-n nationalists who need reassured on particular issues along with many ‘others’ who, polling evidence suggests, remain open to persuasion. Talking to them might be more beneficial than anything .\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March . Parents and carers can visit the school at am, pm, and .pm.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers.

Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
