Opposite a country club, it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home that Meghan lived in during her youth. However, the inside was fraught with problems and was where Thomas Jr allegedly smoked weed all day, while dad Thomas Sr worked night and day           The Duchess of Sussex, here on her birthday August 4,  lived in multiple modest homes before finding fame with her role in Suits and marrying Prince HarryMeghan lived on the property until she was two years old and it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home she lived in during her youth.It was located opposite a country club - but the inside was fraught with problems, according to acclaimed biographer Andrew Morton, who wrote the book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Thomas Jr smoked weed all day and even her mother would share a joint with a neighbor, while TV lighting director Thomas worked night and day, and wild teen Samantha would be out clubbing.Doria and Thomas had married at the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple on Sunset Blvd, in a \u0027hippie wedding\u0027 in December 1979.They orced four years later and Meghan went to live with her mother in a top-floor apartment on S. Cloverdale Ave, Mid-Wilshire.It was once the garage and loft space for the main front property.This was recently renovated and is currently for rent at $3,950 a month, ten times what her mother would have been paying over 30 years previously.Although Meghan lived in modest homes, she attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten called Little Red Schoolhouse which starts at $18,800 a year for kindergarten and $22,600 year for sixth-grade.  After her parents orced in 1983, Meghan and her mother Doria moved into a top-floor apartment (pictured) in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of LA. The apartment previously served as the garage and loft space of the main front property. The Duchess of Sussex split her time here and at her father\u0027s home until she graduated high school in 1999    Meghan and Doria lived behind this two-bedroom, one bathroom house (pictured) on South Cloverdale Avenue. Their home was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her father worked and where she spent time after schoolThe school was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her Emmy-winning father worked on the set of Married With Children and where she would spend her days after school.Her mother Doria, 62, had a less glamorous location for her line of business, which was still only a stone\u0027s throw away from the school - now called the Hollywood Schoolhouse.She owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea St in Hancock Park for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. As can be seen in our photos, the run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium, which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated.When Meghan moved on to the $15,900-a-year Immaculate Heart High School, which she attended from 1991 to 1999, she lived with her dad on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition.This is where Thomas recently said in an interview that he\u0027d warned his daughter off the controversial religion after catching her lingering outside the building.Her father\u0027s apartment was on the ground floor and had two tiny bedrooms with bars across the windows.She lived there until she was 17. Now the place has been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years.          Meghan\u0027s mother Doria, 62, previously owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea Ave in Hancock Park - just a few blocks away from Meghan\u0027s elementary school for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. The run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium (pictured) which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated          Meghan began splitting her time between her mom\u0027s house and her dad\u0027s Hollywood apartment (pictured) when she was 11 until she left for college in 1999. Thomas Sr was living in a two-bedroom ground floor flat on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition          Thomas Sr\u0027s apartment, pictured above with bars across the window, was a short distance to Meghan\u0027s high school. According to a biography on the duchess, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week,\u0027 however, as she got older, there was friction between the two since she felt she was the one who was mothering her father          Not so shabby: The home has since been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years. Pictured above is the large living space of the Hollywood home   The two-bedroom, two-bath home located in the heart of Hollywood is now listed for rent.

It was a source of friction, especially when she started dating,\u0027 the book states. Meghan also had various part-time jobs and volunteer work including bussing tables and serving food at the Hippie Kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles, a Catholic set up to help the homeless living in the notorious Skid Row.She was an assistant at the Paper Store in Beverly Hills, where she also taught calligraphy, and served frozen yogurt at Humphrey Yogart, in Sherman Oaks.When she left high school to attend Northwestern University in Illinois she met film producer Trevor Engelson in a bar on one of her visits back home in LA.Royal reporter claims journalists are being kept at a...Meghan Markle \u0027is at her wits\u0027 end over her father\u0027s public...Share this article \u0027When Meghan first met him on that night out in West Hollywood, she liked what she saw and was attracted to his passion, drive, and ambition.

In short, she had a moral compass.\u0027Despite wanting to be a Hollywood star, it was her faith that was equally important and the central pillar for Meghan and Doria. So much so, that we can disclose she was once a youth minister for the Agape International Spiritual Center, which her mum is still a member today, along with TV host Oprah Winfrey.Sharon Fox, now an executive producer at California Motion Picture Company, was also a member and told her Facebook followers about bumping into the duchess and her husband Prince Harry in Dublin earlier this month.\u0027It was such a nice surprise to bump into them when I went to Dublin to view the Book of Kells.

I pay £63,000 a year in business rates and what do I have to show for it? When I call the police, they don’t care.’Surrey Police said officers had attended the site and were investigating a series of reported thefts. In a statement, they added: ‘Most unauthorised encampments are dealt with appropriately as a civil law matter between the trespassers and the landowner.‘Legislation requires us to balance the impact of the camp with the rights of the inidual.’Mrs Mitchell, who sits on Elmbridge Borough Council, says travellers had been making unauthorised visits to Cobham for most of her time in the village. But until recently the number of caravans had been small, the arrivals infrequent and the police had swiftly moved them on.‘In the old days it was OK,’ she said. ‘The last two or three years have been awful. The response I have been having from members of the public on emails and phone calls, well, I have never in 35 years known this level of anger. They are asking why they are paying the police because they are useless. There is talk of withholding the policing precept from council tax.‘Most people in Cobham are Remain voters but now some are saying what we need is a Donald Trump in this country. They would not have said that a year ago.’While many other affluent towns report similar problems, in Cobham the past 12 months has seen an almost constant battle between travellers and locals. Last summer a large group of travellers arrived on a field known as Leg O’Mutton.‘There were maybe about 60 vans on there and the travellers rode quad bikes over the football pitches,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘They destroyed the goal posts and broke all the glass in the neighbouring community garden and stole equipment and money from the shed.’ The edge of the area was used as a lavatory and an old van was left behind on the site, with the council facing a clean-up bill of several thousand pounds.Earlier this year, travellers invaded Sainsbury’s car park. There were incidents of shoplifting, one customer was bitten by a traveller’s dog, the supermarket’s cafe was closed for the duration and there was a major impact on sales. Sainsbury’s has since erected a height barrier to prevent caravans entering the car park.          Officers were photographed apparently clearing human waste from tennis courts‘Sainsbury’s are in a better position than ourselves because they are private landowners and can get bailiffs in far quicker than we can for public land,’ Mrs Mitchell said. She says travellers send in others to break down the gates so when they move in they can claim the site was already open.‘Unless we pay security guards 247, which we can’t afford, there is very little we can do to stop them,’ she said. ‘Most of the incursions are happening next to people who are not living in the large, expensive houses. They are affecting the ordinary population, stopping mothers with small children who want to use a safe play area.’During the late May bank holiday, travellers took over the car park at Painshill, an award-winning garden. It had to be closed during one of the most lucrative weekends of the year. When bailiffs evicted them, the travellers simply broke into a council-owned field next door.In June they arrived on Cobham Recreation Field. After they were evicted, the children’s play area had to be closed and specialist cleaners hired. It had just reopened when they returned last week.A few days ago, the council evicted French travellers who had camped in a field of cherry trees planted as a war memorial.Last Tuesday the latest travellers were issued with a notice to leave by Elmbridge Council. On Friday, Guildford magistrates took eight minutes to grant the local authority’s application to have 32 caravans and 35 other vehicles evicted from Cobham Recreation Field.None of the travellers attended court but their leader, Martin Casey, said: ‘Magistrates should do a bit more thinking about where we are going to go, not just signing everything the council tell them to. We’ve nowhere to go, we leave this park and now we have to look for another park in the next town.‘They are pushing us on like cattle all over the place.’That they have left – for now – will come as some relief to residents. But how long the peace will last over a long, hot summer remains to be seen. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/01/3BDEDA0D00000578-0-image-m-40_1533601544546.jpg","title":"Dozen Labour MPs secret plot oust Corbyn hatch plans 144 night farmhouse","story":"    Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured) is reportedly facing a plot from moderate MPs   From left: Chuka Umunna, Stephen Kinnock and Liz Kendall have reportedly made plans          Left-wing activists flocked to Twitter to threaten to deselect the Labour moderates who have been plotting on the away days           Another Corbynista accused the Labour moderates of being wolves in sheep\u0027s clothing           Another left-wing activist took to twitter to vent her fury and brand the MPs at the centre of the alleged plot clowns Labour deputy leader Tom Watson is hit by barrage of vile...Labour DROPS probe into veteran MP Margaret Hodge for...Share this articleThe wave of anger on social media came after The Express revealed that around 12 Labour MPs have been meeting at a luxury farmhouse in the countryside. The group of MPs, which also included Chris Leslie and John Woodcock - who recently quit Labour - met at Fair Oak Farm, which is set in 12 acre site and costs £144 a night to stay in. Their meetings have emerged as Mr Corbyn\u0027s relationship with his moderate MPs have plumbed new lows in the wake of the anti-Semitism crisis.The MPs fear that the Labour leader\u0027s failure to tackle the racism combined with his far left policies will make the party  unpalatable to the mainstream British political opinion and unelectable.Corbynistas unleashed their fury at the alleged plot online - and vowed to get their revenge by deselecting the MPs. A Twitter user called Jim wrote: \u0027Yet another plot that should be dug up and kicked out of the Labour Party for trying to illegally replace their leader. \u0027Shower of baskets who know what they are doing - keeping the Tories in power at Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s expense.

Corbyn\u0027s policies are what would make Labour win! Not this bunch of clowns.\u0027One Twitter user posted a picture of a wolf in sheep\u0027s clothing with the message:   \u0027The anti-Corbyn alliance is said to include numerous formerly high-profile right-wing Labour MPs including Liz Kendall, Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, Stephen Kinnock, Gavin Shuker.\u0027The most recent meeting was in May, it was claimed. Former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and and independent MP John Woodcock are also said to have attended. A source at the meetings told the Express: \u0027We are getting together regularly to discuss how to take back control of the party.\u0027At some point the Corbyn leadership is going to fail and collapse, we only need to see what is happening with the anti-Semitism problem, and we need to be ready to step in, win the leadership rebuild the party as a credible force and repair the damage that has been done.\u0027Plotters were said to have travelled to the village of Stonegate from Waterloo East before taking a taxi to the historic farm site.  Among the plans reportedly discussed were proposals for a new party and a scheme to block Mr Corbyn from becoming PM even if he won an election. One person who attended apparently said that some pro-Remain Conservative and Lib Dem MPs would be interested in joining a centrist movement.   Other meetings are said to have taken place elsewhere.

Now there are only signs like tattoos or scarification which mean that this person was one of the tribes member.

Karo people use white clay to paint their bodies, starting anew every morning, creating everything from animal patterns to stars, spots and flowers on their skin.   The Karo people, left, decorate their bodies with white chalk, while the Mentawai from Indonesia use tattoos and - although not seen in this image - they also sharpen their teeth           Beauty: The Hamer tribe use clay and fat to create their distinctive hairstyles, and decorate their clothes with colourful beads   Dying out: Two elderly Kalinga people, from the northern Philippines, show off the tattoos covering their upper bodies          Fighting spirit: The Iban, also known as Sea Dayaks, mostly live in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, and used to be known as a fearsome warrior tribeMr Koziol has so far documented 18 tribes in Africa and Asia, but has a list of 50 more he wants to reach in future.\u0027I think it was the first tribe I managed to take some pictures of, the Iban tribe, who left the biggest impression on me,\u0027 added Koziol.\u0027Apart from that, it was a great adventure for me to be around the Mentawai people in Siberut Island next to Sumatra.

I pay £63,000 a year in business rates and what do I have to show for it? When I call the police, they don’t care.’Surrey Police said officers had attended the site and were investigating a series of reported thefts. In a statement, they added: ‘Most unauthorised encampments are dealt with appropriately as a civil law matter between the trespassers and the landowner.‘Legislation requires us to balance the impact of the camp with the rights of the inidual.’Mrs Mitchell, who sits on Elmbridge Borough Council, says travellers had been making unauthorised visits to Cobham for most of her time in the village. But until recently the number of caravans had been small, the arrivals infrequent and the police had swiftly moved them on.‘In the old days it was OK,’ she said. ‘The last two or three years have been awful. The response I have been having from members of the public on emails and phone calls, well, I have never in 35 years known this level of anger. They are asking why they are paying the police because they are useless. There is talk of withholding the policing precept from council tax.‘Most people in Cobham are Remain voters but now some are saying what we need is a Donald Trump in this country. They would not have said that a year ago.’While many other affluent towns report similar problems, in Cobham the past 12 months has seen an almost constant battle between travellers and locals. Last summer a large group of travellers arrived on a field known as Leg O’Mutton.‘There were maybe about 60 vans on there and the travellers rode quad bikes over the football pitches,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘They destroyed the goal posts and broke all the glass in the neighbouring community garden and stole equipment and money from the shed.’ The edge of the area was used as a lavatory and an old van was left behind on the site, with the council facing a clean-up bill of several thousand pounds.Earlier this year, travellers invaded Sainsbury’s car park. There were incidents of shoplifting, one customer was bitten by a traveller’s dog, the supermarket’s cafe was closed for the duration and there was a major impact on sales. Sainsbury’s has since erected a height barrier to prevent caravans entering the car park.          Officers were photographed apparently clearing human waste from tennis courts‘Sainsbury’s are in a better position than ourselves because they are private landowners and can get bailiffs in far quicker than we can for public land,’ Mrs Mitchell said. She says travellers send in others to break down the gates so when they move in they can claim the site was already open.‘Unless we pay security guards 247, which we can’t afford, there is very little we can do to stop them,’ she said. ‘Most of the incursions are happening next to people who are not living in the large, expensive houses. They are affecting the ordinary population, stopping mothers with small children who want to use a safe play area.’During the late May bank holiday, travellers took over the car park at Painshill, an award-winning garden. It had to be closed during one of the most lucrative weekends of the year. When bailiffs evicted them, the travellers simply broke into a council-owned field next door.In June they arrived on Cobham Recreation Field. After they were evicted, the children’s play area had to be closed and specialist cleaners hired. It had just reopened when they returned last week.A few days ago, the council evicted French travellers who had camped in a field of cherry trees planted as a war memorial.Last Tuesday the latest travellers were issued with a notice to leave by Elmbridge Council. On Friday, Guildford magistrates took eight minutes to grant the local authority’s application to have 32 caravans and 35 other vehicles evicted from Cobham Recreation Field.None of the travellers attended court but their leader, Martin Casey, said: ‘Magistrates should do a bit more thinking about where we are going to go, not just signing everything the council tell them to. We’ve nowhere to go, we leave this park and now we have to look for another park in the next town.‘They are pushing us on like cattle all over the place.’That they have left – for now – will come as some relief to residents. But how long the peace will last over a long, hot summer remains to be seen. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/08/4EE46D5A00000578-6034329-image-a-1_1533627683911.jpg","title":"Two children left roasting car DOCTOR parent 80F midday heat","story":"    Morrison\u0027s shoppers rushed to rescue two children left alone in a hot car in Reigate, Surrey on Monday.

The artist showcases artwork she has made through her initiative Art Made Between Opposite Sides (Ambos), such as Performance Crafting, a community-driven project made with locals from both sides of the border. On view until 2 October, the artist uses the accessible nature of craft to engage people to think about border issues.“It’s not just the reductive rhetoric we’ve seen on TV, it’s about connecting to personal stories, thinking about mothers, families and children being separated,” said the curator, Shannon R. Stratton. “That’s the important story we’re trying to tell.” For one art project, Aguiñiga and a group of volunteers visited the border to ask commuters to fill out a postcard, which asked: “What are your thoughts when you cross this border?” The responses ranged from anger to fear, boredom to thankfulness. More than 6,000 postcards have been collected and 96 are on view in the exhibition. Aguiñiga has taken a staircase in the exhibition to feature a list of questions authorities ask border-crossers at the entry point to the US, which range from “Has anyone in your family been convicted of a crime?” to “Do you fear for your life going back to your home country?” “Her own personal experience with border emotions is brought into the work,” said Stratton. “It taps into what the border means to the US and Mexico it’s a shared liminal space, it’s not just how its framed as an immigration issue in the US.” Alongside the Aguiñiga exhibitionis La Frontera: Encounters Along the Border, which features 62 works of art by 48 artists from Mexico, Latin America and beyond, who look at the border through the world of jewelry, and runs until 23 September. La Frontera, which translates into ‘the border’ in Spanish, looks at the stereotypes surrounding the complications of crossing the US-Mexican border - the most frequently-crossed one in the world. Artists respond to this with jewelry pieces that tap into the more personal side of things.“In 2016, Trump was already talking about building a wall and people were aware of atrocities at the border, but there are real human stories beyond the violence and drugs,” said the exhibition curator Barbara Gifford. “At a time when the personal has become lost in the political, this exhibition reminds us of our shared humanity.” Among the jewelry pieces on view is No-Man’s Land, a brooch by Scottish designer Judy McCaig, who uses rusted steel and silver to reference the dangerous mountain climb migrants make to cross the border.There is also Three Days Walking (Mourning Brooch), a pin by San Francisco designer Julia Turner, which is based on border crossing warning maps, each of which have red dots representing where people have died while making their pilgrimage. Mexican designer Raquel Bessudo shows her La Bestia necklace, which is in reference to the cargo trains that immigrants jump on to enter the US. “It’s one way men, women and children head north, by getting on top of trains — it’s a very dangerous act,” said Gifford. “It can take months for them to cross the border and the artist’s piece is commemorative of that, it represents a way out to people.” “The fact that people would put themselves in this danger tells you the type of danger they’re trying to escape,” she adds. Providence-based designer Kevin Hughes shows a necklace made from recycled water jug handles that aid workers have left along the border — one of which is painted in the colors of the Mexican flag. “He was struck by these good Samaritan acts where people put out jugs of water for others making the journey through the desert,” said Gifford. “Authorities, if they catch you, make you slash the jugs and empty the water the artist sees it as a symbol of somebody’s life, the jug as the icon of the migrant.”Some of the other jewelry pieces use the design of the border wall for rings, while others feature graves of migrants who died trying to cross the border. “Artists are talking about stories that touch them personally,” said Gifford. “This exhibition is trying to say ‘these are people just like us, they’re going through experiences they’re trying to save themselves and their families from they’re reaching out for better possibilities for themselves.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db2db2a937ab5e0cc053239625cd79b53710e28/0_0_3434_2289/master/3434.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=783f2eaba81f7a859ed2dd35b432a22a 480w","title":"facebook defends decision not to suspend blair cottrell over comments","story":"Tech giant says far-right extremist’s comment did not breach standards since it did not ‘incite’ rape The far-right extremist Blair Cottrell has posted on Facebook and Twitter about hypothetically raping staff members at Sky News following his weekend interview on the network, but the social media platforms have not disabled his accounts.A video excerpt of his interview on Sky News on Sunday night, conducted by the former Northern Territory chief minister Adam Giles, has been removed from Facebook and Twitter after complaints by the network that it breached their copyright.Cottrell has a long history of being banned from both platforms, including a six-month ban from Facebook, but the platform has reviewed his recent post about rape and found it did not breach standards.“Anyone would think I went on the air and spat in the face of the presenter then raped the entire staff on my way out,” Cottrell said on his Facebook page, which has 18,000 followers.A Facebook spokesman said because the comment was not directed at a particular person, and did not “incite” rape, it did not breach standards.His comment on Twitter on Tuesday morning was more direct and named Sky presenter Laura Jayes, who was the first Sky presenter – though not the last – to condemn him publicly.Twitter is reviewing the post but has not responded to a request for comment yet.Blair wrote: “I might as well have raped @ljayes on the air, not only would she have been happier with that but the reaction would’ve been the same.”This tweet was deleted but Cottrell later claimed it was deleted by Twitter rather than him. Twitter has not confirmed this.Jayes said the comment proved that Cottrell was not only a “fascist” but was also “dangerous”.Cottrell said he had been banned from Sky and other media platforms because he was “too articulate”.Sky hosted Cottrell, a carpenter and bodybuilder, in its Melbourne studio for a one-on-one discussion about immigration on Sunday night, tweeting his 10-minute rant about immigration based on race and his preference for white South African farmers to fill the migration quota.The leader of the United Patriots Front, a far-right nationalist group, has a criminal history that includes being found guilty last year of inciting contempt, revulsion or ridicule of Muslims. The bodybuilder and carpenter has also claimed to have manipulated women “using violence and terror”, and previously said he wanted a portrait of Hitler in every school classroom.Sky has suspended Giles’s program and shaken up its management structure in the wake of the outcry. At least one major company has withdrawn its advertisements from Sky News following Cottrell’s appearance, while the former Labor minister Craig Emerson quit his role as a network commentator."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5340370fc5c96ed2e2efd2f1e310f5e5b61eb7d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83304ab1649fbc6c50b52eadbcf0740e","title":"not the booker prize 2018 shortlist announced time to start reading","story":"In a very close public vote, five novels have emerged as contenders, with one final choice still to come from the judges The votes have been cast and counted and we have an almost complete Not the Booker prize shortlist for 2018.

So thank you to everyone who participated. Extra special thanks are due to the excellent Lisa L Jones, for her incomparable spreadsheeting skills and for counting, checking and validating every vote. So far, it’s been a remarkably smooth and civilised process. Thanks also to all the authors who had a book in the competition. And commiserations to all those who didn’t make it – not least because it was a close-run thing right until the final hours. While I’m doling out sympathy, I hope you aren’t too disappointed if you nominated or voted for a book and it didn’t get through.

My review for the first book, Naomi Booth’s Sealed, will be published around 20 August.Before we get to that stage, there’s one more important thing. Our three judges from last year are currently deep in discussion about the sixth book to add to our 2018 shortlist. I’ll make an announcement about that early next week. I’ll also explain then how you can become a judge for this year’s competition and have your opinion counted alongside the public vote in the final round. For now, anyone interested in participating should review this section from our amazing, smart and generally tremendous terms and conditions: 1.

The process by which these readers are chosen is also left studiously vague and at the ’s discretion.

It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

The metals and technology magnate made offers to buy out Kroenke but was rebuffed, and in the end he has realised it is pointless to cling on to his stake in the club. Stymied by the fact that nobody else was going to buy his share to be similarly frozen out, he has made the decision to sell to Kroenke for about £600m. Usmanov’s profits are in the hundreds of millions based on his initial investment.It’s not a terrible outcome for him, but it is a serious concern to Arsenal fans who now face the prospect of seeing their club privately owned by one man. And it should be of concern not just to those who follow Arsenal but to football fans in general. Once they are bought, assets can be stripped or clubs allowed to fall in to disrepair, with nothing the fans can do to stop it. It’s very much a worst-case scenario, but when it all goes wrong – as it has at Coventry, which is owned by a London-based hedge fund – the impact on a club and a community can be devastating.KSE has funded the large part of the offer to Usmanov with a loan from Deutsche Bank, and although they say in their statement to the stock exchange that this is “not being funded by way of any debt finance”, nobody would be any the wiser if, after he assumes full control, Kroenke leverages the value of Arsenal to service that loan.Not once in the 11 years since Kroenke first bought shares in the club has this billionaire put a single penny into the team. Arsenal have famously been run as a self-sustaining business, spending only what they earn – and there’s something to admire about that. In fact, far from putting money into the team, he has actively taken money out, twice taking payments of £3m for “consultancy services”, until fan disquiet ensured that those payments stopped.With no AGM, no public accounts, and nobody able to hold him to his responsibilities, there’s nothing to stop Kroenke making similar payments or taking fees in the future. Of course that has to be balanced with the obvious need to run Arsenal in a way that doesn’t negatively impact on its value and thus Kroenke’s investment, but when your club becomes just the latest addition to a wealthy man’s portfolio it’s hard not to worry. Kroenke has been the majority shareholder since 2011, but there has been almost no meaningful engagement with fans. With TV deals providing vast amounts of income, Arsenal under Kroenke haven’t just coasted along, but gone backwards. They no longer play Champions League football, the club is not as attractive as it once was, and even with a new coach following the departure of Arsene Wenger, it feels as if there’s a huge amount to do to make meaningful progress on the pitch. Unless the American actually puts some of his money where his mouth is, it will be an uphill struggle. And a fanbase who were not quiet when it came to letting a legendary figure like Wenger know what they thought, will certainly be forthright in their views.The question is whether Kroenke, on the other side of the Atlantic, will actually care. From the evidence we have seen until now, the chances are he won’t, and even if fans find their voice the club’s owner doesn’t have to listen.The Premier League brought about a sea change in English football, with fans becoming consumers or customers, and the clubs themselves assets for rich businessmen to snap up. Fifteen of 20 Premier League clubs now have offshore owners. Arsenal was traditionally known as the Bank of England club. The Deutsche Bank-funded KSE Investment club doesn’t have quite the same ring.• Andrew Mangan is a writer, Arsenal blogger and has edited and authored two Arsenal books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42c8fa713bde9885cba157763a3327b0334253e/0_176_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cee0c675310709d5b2bae432ba3a6fc","title":"universal basic income rich finland work benefits","story":"The Finnish basic income trial, of which I am part, finishes at the end of the year. Having been interviewed by nearly 70 separate media outlets, from the BBC to Le Figaro, the question I have been asked most often has been: how has the basic income trial changed my life? My answer is simple. In money terms, my life has not changed at all. However, the psychological effects of this human experiment have been transformative. I vastly prefer basic income to a benefits system fraught with complicated forms, mandatory courses and pointless obligations.Before the trial, the risk of losing unemployment benefits and the cumbersome process of reapplying for them were an obstacle to accepting small job assignments. The bureaucracy involved made accepting some not worthwhile, or simply too risky.The basic income trial started at the beginning of 2017. A random sample of 2,000 people aged 25 to 58 was chosen to take part and receive a monthly income of €560 (£475), with no requirement to seek or accept employment. The precondition was that the participants had received either a labour-market subsidy or a basic unemployment allowance from Finland’s social insurance institution Kela in November 2016. At that point I had just run out of a grant I had received and was officially a jobseeker, making me eligible to take part. The Finnish government wanted to find out if jobseekers obtain work more easily when the basic unemployment allowance is replaced with a basic income. During the trial the participants had the right to keep their basic income even if they found work.The idea is that temporary and part-time work is becoming increasingly common, which may mean there is also a growing interest in social security models that support the acceptance of such work. The basic income trial has indeed resulted in work for myself and many other participants, from IT experts, artists and commerce professionals to new graduates. And there is little doubt that the trial benefits people in creative fields, freelancers, people doing expert work and project workers – an ever-increasing number of people.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theConcerns have been voiced about the high cost of the basic income model. But free school meals, free basic education and universal basic healthcare are expensive too. Critics say that basic income at the level used in the trial cannot be extended to cover the entire population as this would create an adverse balance of some €10-15bn. But atypical employment relationships are on the increase and our social security system has become outdated. The system requires more investment to boost the minimum income level, to improve the level of financial incentives and to simplify it. Basic income models do come with a small increase in taxation. For a large number of employed people this will, however, be compensated for by the basic income. As more people manage to find work while supported by basic income, taxation for everyone can be eased. In terms of purchasing power, basic income would have a predominantly positive effect as it would help people in low-income jobs the most. The critics fear that basic income will make people lazy. However, limited evidence from several basic-income trials from around the world prove that people use basic income to improve their quality of life and not as a licence to do nothing. Research has shown that unemployed people do not have a low motivation for work. Neither is it justified to say that unemployment on a large scale is the result of an unwillingness to work. The isolated cases of lazy, work-averse iniduals so eagerly highlighted by the media do not represent the situation accurately.I hope this trial encourages future governments to examine fresh options. My living costs today stand at nearly €2,000 a month – it’s a sum I would never be able to pay with just the basic income. And that was not the idea. Rather, basic income acts as the perfect incentive – it gives you security to chase other opportunities. It pushes you to seek fulfilling work – and isn’t that what unemployment benefits should do? • Tuomas Muraja is a journalist and writer who is taking part in the Finnish basic income trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0694f19270efc27e3edfcff02728525b768a6b96/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=000004baa48049b11dc934dd1d879268","title":"domino effect of climate events could push earth into a hothouse state","story":"Leading scientists warn that passing such a point would make efforts to reduce emissions increasingly futile A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile, a group of leading climate scientists has warned.This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic.The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature.They warn that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.”“I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We need to know now. It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.“We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state.As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years.Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.“The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”“In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac1ed962b2cebcecfcb4e65d0f2a7b98b5cdee2/0_171_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718e49ed7c4ca728cfb2900753885931","title":"natural hair nappily ever after","story":"I cut my relaxed hair off three months ago – I don’t regret it, but I can’t deny that I’m conflicted about my decision in a world where natural hair has genuine significanceFinally, a film taking black women’s hair stories to the big screen. Netflix film Nappily Ever After, based on the 2000 book by Trisha R Thomas, tells the story of Violet Jones (Sanaa Lathan) – a black woman who prides herself on her long, straightened hair and is desperate for her boyfriend to propose to her. Her life starts to fall apart after her boyfriend presents her with a dog rather than a ring, and so she cuts both him and her hair off. “My hair was like a second job,” she says. “Now I’m forced to focus on myself. I wonder who I’ll be?”It’s deep stuff – if you know where to look. The natural-hair movement has been in full swing since the mid-00s but there are plenty of black women, like me, who are still at the beginning of their journeys. I\u0026nbspcut my relaxed hair off three months ago. I don’t regret my decision, but I\u0026nbspcan’t deny that I often feel ugly and conflicted about my hair’s texture.The gravity of a black woman deciding to cut her hair off and go “natural” in a white supremacist society (yes, ours) should not be underestimated. Almost every black hairdresser I visited before finally plucking up the courage to cut my hair off told me I was making the wrong decision, but it was a reminder of how deeply entrenched these views are.This isn’t just about looks: our wider history is stained by instances such as the apartheid-era pencil test in South Africa – those who could hold a pencil in their hair without it falling out could not be classified as white. To this day, black women and girls lose job offers and are sent to detention or are suspended because our hairstyles don’t suit white sensibilities.The natural-hair movement itself has biases: its obsession with “laying your edges” (using gel products to flatten the edges of your hair), and the way glossy curls are championed over kinks. Even Lathan has a loose-textured curl that sits closer to acceptability than a texture like my own. I believe black women can wear a weave or relax their hair and still love themselves, but I wonder where the film will draw the line in terms of the reliance many of us have on chemical straighteners and weaves. We are not a monolith and rather than insecurity, many decisions stem from practicality or fun – who wouldn’t want rainbow braids for Black Pride? Beyond that, I don’t think you can blame us for falling into the grips of what society has always said is “good hair”.It is a shame that Nappily Ever After doesn’t feature a black woman whose hair is more tightly textured, but I’m hopeful that the cheesy rom-com will go some way in terms of normalising what is already normal: the hair that grows out of our heads and what we choose to do with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ff266f750b3c71daf7bd1b9ef52ce0faa763c6a/0_78_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a740c56771874279afc3ddd979d4e331","title":"blackkklansman the grim topicality of spike lees 70s set kkk film","story":"In the acclaimed director’s new fact-based tale of infiltrating the Klu Klux Klan, he makes salient comparisons with life for people of color in Trump’s AmericaTwenty-nine years ago, Roger Ebert said of Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing that “it comes closer to reflecting the current state of race relations in America than any other movie of our time”. Now, with BlacKkKlansman, the 61-year-old film-maker again proves his work to be deserving of such a bold statement.His latest is a historic depiction of race relations yet has its gaze firmly set on present racial problems. It’s based on the real life experiences of Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs police department’s first black police officer. Stallworth’s undercover operation, which saw him artfully infiltrate a local Ku Klux Klan chapter, earned him the unintended respect and reverence of KKK leader and grand wizard, David Duke.Though the events of the movie feel bound by history, its commentary provides insight into how America still struggles with race. The intensified strain within the film feels relevant once again with Duke-endorsed president Donald Trump screaming that it’s time to “take our country back”.And the film demonstrates that it is against this backdrop that people of color are expected to survive and thrive in America.For Stallworth, surviving on the job meant that he had to possess the ability to be both a “model negro” and to be perpetually forgiving. Stallworth, played by John David Washington, is answering question after question during an interview with the police chief and a black mayoral representative, when he’s told to be the Jackie Robinson of the police department. His conduct was of superior importance for the mayoral representative as he reminded Ron that if someone called him the N-word to “turn the other cheek”.While this may have been an instruction for Washington’s character in the 1970s – being the kind of black person that society perceives Jackie Robinson to be and the type to turn the other cheek – many people of color still follow this guidance today.Narratives about civil rights victories are inherently tricky because telling those stories is not proprietary to any particular group. There’s a reason why the more radical nature of Martin Luther King Jr’s speeches and beliefs never made it into our classroom textbooks. And there’s a reason why whites and blacks alike can herald Jackie Robinson as a civil rights hero yet can be so split on Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem. And there’s a reason why we conveniently forget that even Jackie Robinson had his moments of what some might consider radical: “I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag I know that I am a black man in a white world.”Through the rose-colored lens of respectability politics, we often choose to craft historical narratives in a way that removes any offense from our mainstream sensibilities. So in our textbooks, we sterilize King and Robinson’s doses of radicalism to ensure that mainstream America doesn’t feel guilt for the egregious actions of its past. This neutered view of race, informed by bad recollections of history, forced Ron and continues to force many people of color to fit into boxes of docile activism.The expectations of the meek, mild, compromising black leader didn’t fit well with Ron’s first undercover assignment to detect radicalism in Kwame Ture’s (formerly Stokely Carmichael, noted pan-Africanist and Black Panther) speech to a college group. During the dramatized scene, Ture warns of a coming war. For the police listening in, it was cause to be concerned for safety while the open target practice and talks of detonating a bomb by members of the Klan warranted very little concern on the part of the police officers.Part of how Stallworth got his way into Duke’s good graces in the film was his ability to modulate his voice on the phone and use references white people would appreciate.Juggling his blackness while appealing to mainstream attitudes was what Ron called “speaking the King’s English and talking jive”. It’s something that people of color do every day. WEB DuBois, famed civil rights activist and sociologist, called it “double-consciousness”. He described it as “a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity”.Some call it code-switching, but while it might sound like a convenience, it’s actually a means of survival.Watching Ron live out this double-consciousness immediately triggered vivid memories of my own management of double consciousness – conducting that tricky dance that leaves no room for inelegance. Whether in classrooms or working environments I, like plenty of people of color, modulate our voices, adjust our actions, and pay careful attention to our tone.But most resoundingly, BlacKkKlansman reminds us that racism has an evolving set of semantics and tactics.Towards the middle of the film, Ron’s supervising officer talks about the shifting battlefield of upholding racist structures. While the burning of crosses, he warns, would persist, the changing landscape ensured that racism and cross burning would become dirty words and dirtier activities, respectively. The new tactics employed by racists would center around more targeted policy.Duke runs down a list of the policy issues that would help extend white supremacy: voting rights, affirmative action, and more. The film demonstrates the everlasting link between the racist origins of these policies and their disparate racial impacts. And now, years after, we mistakenly disentangle the push to suppress these opportunities for equity and equality for people of color with their discriminatory origins.But because we have suppressed them, we call them different terms. We call the desire to ensure that blacks can’t catch up academically “affirmative action” and bludgeon the policy practice’s reputation. We call the supervision of formerly confederate states’ voting processes government overreach, instead of what it is: the empowering of the vote for people of color.And just when one began to believe that this stealthier, public policy approach to racism had fully replaced the violent and gruesome manifestations of white supremacy, the film cuts to scary, and at times bloody scenes of Charlottesville.But potentially more powerful, is a video of Donald Trump’s epic false equivalence of protestors during the Charlottesville Unite-the-Right events. It’s followed by present-day David Duke, laudably quoting Trump as a rallying cry to his crowd of supporters: “it’s time to take our country back”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a0296f26e488a537d4eb32d3a1778c9fb320ec/611_623_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0c7645a209ab5fb732d91d52f6fca67","title":"premier league 2018 19 preview manchester united","story":"José Mourinho has been a discontented figure in recent weeks and the season must start well if they are to challenge City writers’ predicted position: 3rd (NB: this is not necessarily Jamie Jackson’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 7-1Contretemps, a reluctant U-turn and the declaration: “I didn’t learn anything.” José Mourinho offered maximum José Mourinho during a Manchester United pre-season tour of the US that came close to farce.The fascination now is just how United will begin their Premier League campaign after a five-game trip that took in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Santa Clara, Ann Arbor and Miami and ended with two wins, two draws and a defeat. A 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena has only further increased the Portuguese’s pessimism.United’s opening two outings are Old Trafford’s curtain raiser with Leicester and the journey to Brighton. These games are mentioned because of one of the oddest bits of discourse Mourinho offered up during the trip.At United’s UCLA training base in LA he voiced concern that the 13 frontline players he flew to the States without due to post-World Cup breaks would render his side seriously disadvantaged.Mourinho pointed to Leicester missing only Harry Maguire and Jamie Vardy for this same reason and Brighton none. There was no mention of Leicester’s best player, Riyad Mahrez, being sold to Manchester City so severely weakening them, and he seemed to forget the smarts that have made him a serial winner and how he leads the juggernaut that is United.Thus continued a theme that began at his opening media conference when he declared preparation for 2018-19 to be “very bad”. Those two words became Mourinho’s mantra when continually pointing to the missing footballers and lack of major transfers since Fred’s signing in June.These complaints were the basis of Mourinho’s disputes, which, in turn, were fuelled by the pressure he is under. Although United finished second last season, a best since the 2012-13 title triumph, they trailed 19 points behind City.His mission, then, for the season is clear: he has to make United true contenders and not allow another procession from City. Or, worse, be spectators in a City-Liverpool tussle as the latter look certain to challenge.After losing to Bayern Munich 1-0 on Sunday Mourinho once again warned of a “difficult season”, again making pointed remarks about transfers. “My CEO knows what I want and I still have a few days to wait and see what happens. The other clubs who compete with us are really strong and already have fantastic teams. Or they are investing massively like Liverpool, who are buying everything and everybody. If we don’t make our team better, it will be a difficult season for us.”The club have been linked with a move for Bayern’s Jérôme Boateng but Mourinho is also contending with injuries to Nemanja Matic, Antonio Valencia and Diogo Dalot, the 19-year-old full-back signed from Porto who might have replaced the latter if fit.All of this throws up the question of whether Mourinho might again implode in classic third-season fashion as he previously did at Chelsea (twice) and Real Madrid.Following the opening two matches United face Tottenham (home), Burnley, Watford (each away), Wolverhampton (h), West Ham (a), Newcastle (h), Chelsea (a), Everton (h) and Bournemouth (a). These 11 games take United to a date with City at the Etihad Stadium on 10 November. By then everyone should be available and, if Mourinho acquires a centre-back – Maguire is on the list alongside Boateng – his strongest XI might read: De Gea ValenciaDalot, Bailly, MaguireBoateng, YoungShaw Fred, Matic, Pogba Lingard, Lukaku, Sánchez.A picture will have started to form regarding how United will fare, before a derby against the champions and opponents they must have ambitions of beating if they are to end United’s six-year championship drought. There are no guarantees if United depart east Manchester in a lofty position they will end in first place but, if they are in struggling mode, serious questions regarding Mourinho’s future will be aired.Put simply, he has to keep United in the race until May. Last year they won nothing and Mourinho escaped serious scrutiny due to a second-place finish he could – and did – present as progression from a first season when United trailed in sixth, 24 points from the champions, Chelsea.This season Mourinho has to prove he is the man to move the club on from the gilded Sir Alex Ferguson era: only claiming title No 21 or going mightily close will do. To achieve this United will have to take the early part of the campaign by storm as it will be a shock if City fail to do so.Even if Maguire, Boateng or Internazionale’s Ivan Perisic (also on Mourinho’s list) are added, the window is still rated as middling. In this scenario the manager will have to look from within. Required will be a career-high season from Paul Pogba, who has thus far misfired for him, and from Alexis Sánchez, who was below par after joining in January.A big question mark remains over the full-backs. Valencia and Ashley Young are 33 when the season starts and whether the untested Dalot and the enigma that is Luke Shaw can step up and help elevate United is debatable.Anthony Martial’s future is another imponderable. He has seriously fallen out with the manager and following the birth of his child faces disciplinary action for failing to train. If it seems certain Martial will leave – both parties wish this – should Mourinho fail to sign an attacker, and the Frenchman does not get his move, pragmatism means he may be seen in United colours again.The situation is a mess. So, too, was the tour. Mourinho has to ensure the season does not go the same way. If it does, he may be relieved of his duties and United will require a fourth new manager in six years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae67dd20a396793c20eaebca92916cfba483e09/0_75_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=616d1aaa3681e1a73ca4d2ce2ad3d86d","title":"scottish football watching borders photo essay","story":"Take a wander through the Lowland League with Gala Fairydean Rovers, Hawick Royal Albert, Whitehill Welfare and othersBy writer Daniel Gray and photographer Alan McCredie for NutmegSometimes in these still lands, it is hard to imagine a ball being kicked. It seems too strenuous, too disruptive. The Borders are Scotland’s gentlest quarters, serene towns and villages of folk that listen first and talk second. The countryside is polite and cushioning, a lie-in instead of an early start.Here until not so long ago, days jolted along to the clunking noises of textile mills. You can see some of them now in the valley that holds Galashiels in its palm. In bold stone and slate, a number are repurposed. A few are derelict, the forgotten mansions of industrial clout.Today, the Gala Water which once powered them sloshes onwards as if searching for something to do. It looks like it has taken a wrong turning, or misremembered its course have you seen the mill, I’m sure it used to be here... It rattles away next to us as we walk to the ground, its utterings not unlike those of a crowd in the distance. To see the football in these parts, one must look beyond the rugby. So it is walking this way to Netherdale, where the pebbledash of Gala RFC comes before the Brutalist majesty of Galashiels Fairydean Rovers FC. Beyond the turnstiles, the players of Gala and Keith do their hopscotch warm-ups and steam rises from the tea hatch. The hatch and cafe area are new additions, a series of fairy doors for child’s play behind the goals too. In every increment it can afford, here is a club devoted to widening its appeal. Nothing can improve the bar underneath the stand. It is the ticking heart of Fairydean Rovers. Here, wins are predicted and sorrows drowned. Old pals sit together and beckon over the new. The game matters, but not so much as these segments of the day – nothing staves off lonely winters like laughter and shared jeers as the scores from elsewhere come in.The home side have lost four on the bounce, their visitors nine. Perhaps a cup tie will shake free a win. A Keith supporter tells me a tale of his Dad. In 1928, he had watched Celtic come to town in another cup tie, far from here and now. Absent facilities saw the Hoops change away from the ground, and march through tough northern streets in their full kits. The supporter goes quiet, green and white ghosts clacking on the cobbles, marching through his mind.The football is urgent. Netherdale’s 3G bounce occasionally flummoxes the Keith players, puppies chasing leaves in a breeze. Regardless, they score twice and don’t concede. In the Gents afterwards one man sighs and says to another: “Ach, what else would you do with your Saturdays?” “Exactly,” the other replies. “See you next week.”On some other Saturday, we pass more gargling waters in Selkirk and Hawick. It is a soggy afternoon. At Yarrow Park, the goalnets are pinned to the crossbar. There will be no game. Postponement, that dreaded word. The dug-outs are empty, the “Players and Officials” door is bolted. There may as well be a “No Ball Games” sign. Birdsong is the only sound. Snow festers on hills beyond the ground, winter reminding all that it is still alive and well. Oh to watch a game from that shepherd’s kop. A few miles away, Hawick Royal Albert play on, their neighbours too, the town rugby club. Civil Service Strollers are down from Edinburgh. All-blues versus all-reds, the colours of table football or Subbuteo starter-sets. The turn- stile doubles as programme stall and clubshop. Genial Irene in her Honorary President badge takes our money and sells the club to us. Her enthusing stops only when Royal Albert, embedded at the table’s foot, are granted a penalty. It is screwed wide. “Ah just... cannae... believe it,” she chokes.Upon the wooden benches of a quietly regal main stand, other supporters can believe it. They have seen it time and again this season. The penalty miss is as inevitable as the five Strollers goals that follow. In the Art Deco directors’ box seats, foreheads fall into hands. It is best to let matches such as this and places like Albert Park just happen to you. That way are you pleasantly beguiled by the forest that lines the opposite touchline, and enormously comforted by the familiar stock names of Scottish football as they are barked: DAVEY! STEVIE! WEE MAN! BIG MAN!Further, you may become engrossed by the varied noises a wet football pitch makes – squelches, paddling, slurps, slaps, gurgles. You may fixate upon a single tear of rain falling from the stand’s guttering. You may follow its course as it bounces dangerously close to a coffee mug marked “Twat” perched upon the MDF roof of the dugout. You may smile as the Strollers manager offers his gloves to the frozen linesman. At 0-5, the Hawick goalkeeper makes as good a save as I have ever seen.

Is the heatwave causing a mass breakout?Dave Fawbert says he wasn’t alarmed when he came across a boa constrictor on a high street in east London after popping out to buy a loaf of bread. It wasn’t moving, but the head of a pigeon was disappearing within the snake’s coils. “If it had been slithering around, I’d be more freaked out because you don’t know what it’s going to do,” says Fawbert, an editor at Shortlist, who posted a picture of the gruesome scene on Twitter on Saturday. “I wasn’t scared because it was quite obviously motionless – the bird was halfway down its throat and I thought: ‘There’s no way that snake’s going anywhere.’”A couple of other people had stopped, so he asked if anyone knew where it had come from. “No one seemed to know. It was completely without explanation.” A crowd gathered. One person prodded it. “I just said: ‘Leave it, it’s not a danger to anyone.’” Except to the pigeon, he adds. Fawbert, who had been on a snake-handling experience day earlier in the year for his birthday (“I quite like snakes”), called the RSPCA, worried that people would be scared and try to kill it.This seems to be turning into the summer of escaped snakes. Just over a week ago, a 2.4-metre (8ft) python was discovered in a man’s bathroom in Exeter after he heard toiletries and his toothbrush crashing to the floor, and went to investigate. Stuart Saunders, who is visually impaired, tried to pick up the strange tubular shape on the floor, thinking it was a piece of insulation that had fallen from somewhere, and realised it was a huge snake. He called a friend to help deal with it the python was rescued by a nearby exotic pet shop. It is thought it escaped from there and somehow made it to Saunders’ flat through the plumbing.A few days earlier, a woman in Kensington, west London, woke up to find a 1-metre (3ft) royal python curled up in bed next to her. An RSPCA officer, Jill Sanders, caught it the next evening – it had slithered off and was hiding in the flat. It was thought to be an escaped pet. “Reptiles, particularly snakes, can be extremely good escape artists and will take the opportunity of a gap in an enclosure door or a loose-fitting lid,” Sanders says.Before a race in Battersea Park, south-west London, last week, a snake, thought to be a baby boa constrictor, was found by a runner who had gone into the bushes to relieve himself. The organisers put it in a large plastic tub, says Kate Carter, the ’s life \u0026amp style editor, who was running that day. “They covered it up a bit with a hi-vis bib because someone who seemed to know about snakes thought it was exotic and could be cold, even in heatwave London. They looked after it and called the RSPCA, who came to collect it.”In May, the Manchester Evening News reported that Cordelia, a royal python – thought to be pregnant – had escaped from her home in Wythenshawe. “In the day, she just roams around my flat,” said her owner. “They are very intelligent creatures – which is what makes them good escapists as well. People have suggested Cordelia could still be in the flat somewhere, but I think she’ll have gone for a wander round.”It is still too early to say if the number of stray snakes reported this year will be higher than previous years, but they are more likely to be reported in the summer. “There are a couple of theories why this is happening,” says Nicola White, the senior scientific officer for exotics at the RSPCA. Some snakes may have escaped months ago and haven’t been as active during colder weather, “maybe lying dormant somewhere. Then as soon as the warmer weather starts, they come out because they’re more active naturally in heat. The other reason we think there may be more escapees in summer is that there are owners who like to take their snakes outside to enjoy the warmer weather. In theory, it’s a good thing to do – it’s good for an animal to get natural light, natural warmth – but we would discourage anybody from doing that without keeping the snake secure. The problem is they warm up and become quite fast, and that’s when they could escape.”What should you do if you spot a stray snake? White says you should call the RSPCA. “Our advice is always to keep a safe distance – don’t try to collect the snake yourself, or touch it. Just monitor it so we know where it is.” An officer trained in handling exotic animals will attend – for a standard-size boa constrictor, say, one person can catch it. They carry an “exotics kit”, which consists of a snake hook and a bag that can be tied at the top, and they are taught how to collect the snake safely, using the hook to control the head and gently lift it. To collect a very large snake, such as a reticulated python, which can grow to about 6.5 metres (21ft), two officers would be needed. “For one thing, they’re very heavy,” says White. If a venomous snake is on the loose, a specialist will be brought in.Some snakes will have been abandoned, particularly by people who didn’t realise what they were taking on as a pet. “Before going out and buying a reptile on a whim, we’re desperately asking people to do their research – how long is it going to live for, and how are you going to look after it properly?” But as snakes are good at escaping, “We don’t think all the ones we’re picking up have been dumped or abandoned – it’s quite likely a lot of them are escapees.” Snakes can be microchipped, but many aren’t and reuniting them with their owners is very difficult.The public are not particularly at risk, although Newman thinks our long, hot summer will mean more escapees than usual. “We pick a lot of these animals up and you can almost guarantee that if you get a phone call from someone who has found a snake in their garden, it will be the neighbour’s. It’s not an absolute rule, but almost certainly within three doors away you’ll find where it came from.”How far can they move? “They can move fast in short bursts, so they can disappear quite quickly. They’re wanderers, so they will move until they find somewhere they feel comfortable and secure. They could come from next door, find your bathroom and stay there, as long as there’s food. If there isn’t food, they will move again.” Typically, they will feed once a week, or every two or three weeks. “If there’s not any food, not any mice or anything like that, they will move. They can travel quite a long distance, there’s no limit.” A python or boa constrictor could survive outside at this time of year, but will die during the first frost. “Some of the north American snakes can survive our winters,” says Newman. “It’s not uncommon for a corn snake to escape in the autumn and be found in the spring.”Last year, sewage treatment workers in Llanllyfni, Gwynedd, found a corn snake that had escaped – down the toilet – from a house four months previously and reunited it with the owners. In Glasgow, another corn snake was discovered living in the body work of a Transit van its owner had hired to move house five months earlier – it had wriggled free from its bag and box while being transported. The snake was discovered slithering between the seats by someone else who hired the van.In July, Jake, a 1-metre kingsnake, escaped from his vivarium, probably after breaking out through a small vent. His owner, George Mole, had gone away for a few days, leaving his pet snake – one of three – digesting a frozen chick at home in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire. Jake was found a month later, about half a mile from home, after Mole put a post on a local group on Facebook. “It was a bit of a miracle. I think overjoyed is an understatement,” he says, about being reunited. Though he adds that the 14-year-old whose birthday party Jake crashed didn’t feel quite the same. The party, says Mole, “ended up in lots of screaming”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344da9c4bac1848a5cf8bb6fdac9ea601a93922d/0_152_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0abd98875ba1786c8fc52d0d94d71440","title":"last days poundworld bargain chains econonomic downturn close stores","story":"The bargain chain is due to close the last of its 335 stores this week. What happened to the chain’s unstoppable rise?Last week at the doomed branch of Poundworld in Lewisham, south-east London, toothbrushes for dogs – reduced to 70p – were lying opposite reading glasses for 50p. One-litre bottles of antifreeze were still £1, but the 2017 Justin Bieber annuals, piled up like discarded pizza boxes, were down to 50p after an initial drop to 75p failed to shift them. Telescopic fishing nets were also selling slowly. Elsewhere, shelves were bare. These were for sale, too: notices taped to the shop windows advertised the fixtures and fittings. Wire “dump bins”, in which products were once piled high, were going for £10.This was one of the last Poundworld branches still clinging to life. Last month, Deloitte, which has run the chain since it went into administration in June, announced that all 335 shops would be gone by the end of this week, along with the last of more than 5,000 jobs. At lunchtime last Tuesday, the man behind the till in Lewisham didn’t know exactly when the end would come. “They’re saying next week, but it could be tomorrow,” he said as I paid 80p for a phone charger cable and a pack of 50 plant ties.In 2012, when this branch replaced a Peacocks clothes shop on a prime stretch of Lewisham’s bustling high street, the chain was riding high. Four years after the global financial crisis, the retail sector was quaking under an onslaught of discounters. As real incomes were squeezed, the fixed-price chains with their “everything for £1” model were primed to take advantage, offering an Aladdin’s cave of homeware, groceries and trinkets. Just two years ago, Poundworld was opening a new store every week after a £150m takeover by TPG, a US-based private equity group.Pound chains held a certain fascination beyond their pricing and multiplicity of wares. This week, Saving Poundstretcher, a new series on Channel 4, began following the mixed-price discount chain, as its owner, Aziz Tayub, tried to revive it. In a case of awkward broadcast timing, the man we see Tayub bringing in to oversee the turnaround is Chris Edwards, the former market trader who launched and ran Poundworld until 2015, but failed to rescue it last month. He left Poundstretcher in April this year.In 2015, a BBC documentary, Pound Shop Wars, followed the rivalry between Poundworld and the bigger Poundland chain. What happened to Poundworld, which until so recently seemed unstoppable? And what can its rise and fall tell us about the forces that have shaped the high street in the past three decades? Deloitte declined to discuss Poundworld, but the story of its creation can be gleaned from In for a Pound, Edwards’ 2015 autobiography. It charts the lives of a family of travelling showmen who began to drift away from the fairground when Edwards bagged the prime stall on Wakefield market in 1968, when he was 18. In 1974, he opened his first homeware shop in the West Yorkshire town and called it Bargain Centre. Other stores followed, while Edwards also moved into the nightclub business.In 1994, Edwards saw an opportunity in the fixed-price pound shop idea. He was inspired by the early success of Poundland, which had been co-founded in 1990 by former West Midlands market trader Steven Smith (who was in turn inspired by the creation of the pound coin in the 80s). Edwards, who worked with his brother Laurie (his son, Chris Edwards Jr, also later became a senior executive), renamed his six Bargain Centre stores “Everything’s £1” and watched takings rise.It was not exactly a new concept. In 1884, a Polish-Jewish migrant called Michael Marks opened Penny Bazaar in Leeds. His slogan was: “Don’t ask the price, it’s a penny”. Marks joined Tom Spencer, a bookkeeper, and, by 1900, Marks \u0026amp Spencer had 36 Penny Bazaars. Eventually, the pair began moving away from fixed pricing and began trading under their own names. Woolworths started in a similar vein – when the chain arrived in Britain from the US in 1909, almost all its products were priced at threepence or sixpence.Yet fixed-price discounting then fell out of favour for several decades. Leigh Sparks, a professor of retail studies at the University of Stirling, partly blames retail price maintenance, a practice adopted in the 20s under which retailers agreed not to discount manufacturer prices. It was only abandoned in 1964. Other factors were the rising postwar affluence, followed by 70s inflation. “The consumer boom in the 1980s was also anathema to the model,” Sparks says, pointing to a lingering snobbery towards discounted goods in a decade of excess.But by the 90s, Poundland and Everything’s £1 (which Edwards renamed Poundworld in 2003) could tap into a renewed appetite for simple, low prices. “We opened with 648 products and on the first day we took over £13,000,” Smith tells me in an email, recalling the first day of trading at the original Poundland in Burton upon Trent. (Smith sold the company for £50m to a US private equity firm in 2002. It has more than 700 stores and is now owned by Steinhoff International, a South African retail giant, after a separate £610m sale in 2016.)Shoppers were excited, too. “There is this sense of freedom about walking into a pound shop,” says Alison Hulme, a lecturer in international development at the University of Northampton, who specialises in the sociology and history of consumerism, and wrote her PhD on pound shops. “You don’t feel you need to keep track of what you’re spending, because you just count the items in your basket.” There are no shocks at the till in a pound shop, nor any fumbling for coppers.The chains lured supermarket shoppers with everyday goods and groceries, including some from bigger brands. You could go in for a drying rack and come out with a month’s supply of Heinz baked beans. In Poundworld’s Lewisham store, Kath Burton, a shopper in her 80s, told me: “I usually come in for things like fly killer.” This time, she had grabbed a wodge of glittered gift tags from the chaotic array of Christmas goods. (On the next aisle, the chain had brought out a load of Easter products, presumably retrieved from the corner of a warehouse.)Then came 2008 and the economic downturn. Suddenly, bargain-hunting was more necessity than sport. Growth soared and the number of pound shops doubled between 2010 and 2016, according to the retail analyst the Local Data Company, when Poundland and Poundworld peaked with more than 1,000 stores between them. Valuable sites were opening on the high street: more than 130 former Woolworths stores were taken over by fixed-price discounters after the chain failed in 2008. As Edwards’ brother Laurie writes in one chapter of In for a Pound: “Before the tough times, the powers that be didn’t want pound shops in town centres – I think they thought we lowered the tone.”But the economic environment in which Poundworld had flourished was tightening. Competition became fierce with the growth of other big names in discounting, including B\u0026ampM, Home Bargains and Savers, and supermarkets hit back with their own discount lines. Some of the challenges have been universal – online competition, rising rents, business rates and wage bills among them – but margins are particularly tight for pound shops. When the pound drops in value, as it did after the Brexit referendum, or the cost of goods rises with inflation, other stores can raise prices in an instant. Pound shops have to be smarter.At one point, Poundland almost had to stop stocking reading glasses, one of its biggest sellers. “We had to work very hard with our supplier,” says Nick Agarwal, a consultant at the chain. “They took out metal parts from the spring hinge in the arms and changed production to produce the plastic in each pair in one go.” In 2013, Edwards Sr travelled to a factory in China to look at bras, an item typically out of Poundworld’s reach. By reducing the amount of elastic and switching to a cheaper material, Edwards was able to make the price work. He ordered half a million £1 bras on the spot, worked up a smart press release and sold them in days.“Shrinkflation”, whereby bags of Maltesers lose a few grams or a set of pencils a few, well, pencils, is another tactic. The pound chains work directly with manufacturers to tweak packaging and weights. Customers don’t always like it, a response Poundland seized on in 2016 when Mondelez, which makes Toblerone, increased the gaps between the chocolate bar’s Matterhorn-like pieces. Months later, Poundland, which had sold 12m Toblerones a year, created Twin Peaks, a familiar bar with no gaps and two peaks in each piece. (It was inspired by the Wrekin and Ercall hills in Shropshire, not far from Poundland’s headquarters, the chain said.) Now that a legal dispute with Mondelez has been settled, Agarwal says, Twin Peaks will replace Toblerone later this year.The unnamed former Poundworld store manager says the first sign of trouble came when the chain changed its own prices in 2016. “Each week we would be rolling out new shelving bays as ‘manager’s specials’, where prices were written by hand,” the former manager says. “Customers would say: ‘I thought this was supposed to be a pound shop.’” Yet Poundworld was already fixated on growth, desperate to bolster its footfall and purchasing power. It opened a vast new distribution centre in 2016. “Expansion is definitely on our minds,” Edwards Jr wrote in his contribution to his father’s book. “We have research showing there’s definitely room for hundreds more stores. Then we’ve got Europe and the question becomes: ‘Where do you stop?’” This summer, the answer came back.There were several attempts to save Poundworld. The Edwards family tried, even after Edwards Sr had left the company in 2016. Even Smith, the Poundland founder, considered rescuing his old rival. Both men have accused Deloitte of not doing enough, but the administrator said it received no “credible and acceptable bid” for the chain. “It is very difficult to do a deal with a business that is in administration,” Smith says. Meanwhile, there are hundreds more empty stores on high streets.As I browsed the chaotic aisles in Lewisham, a man armed with a clipboard was surveying the store for the landlord. “It’s absolutely massive for this location,” he said, also preferring not to be named. Finding a new tenant may not be easy.The former Poundworld manager, who starts a new job this week, wondered about the state of the business earlier this year when the inventory on the store’s online ordering software began to shrink: “Groceries were going from 24 pages down to 12 and you were worried about filling the shelves.” As rescue attempts failed last month, staff knew it was over. The closing-down sale and clear-out were “heartbreaking … I really struggled to get through it,” the manager says. “It has been like a bereavement. We were tired and we had given this store everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cac462af4707397e3076fbe01d85071105a6c16/365_1946_3999_2399/master/3999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=149783aa9c38ee1b11141d8fd748b5d9","title":"nigel slater salmon with french beans recipe","story":"Creamy, herby, peppery fish with the crunch of green beansChop 20g of dill and 15g of parsley.

Yet non-coeliac gluten sensitivity appears to be a modern condition. While the notion that some forms of gluten could be a potential source of the digestive difficulties, growing numbers of people report suffering has circulated in complementary medicine circles for decades, the gluten avoidance trend has really taken off in the past decade. When Miley Cyrus went public about her “gluten allergy” in 2012 and, in 2013, Gwyneth Paltrow published a gluten-free recipe book, the standard bearers for the anti-gluten movement were born.It is noticeable that gluten sensitivity seems to preoccupy women more than men, which instantly locates it on gendered territory where it can be dismissed, like a Victorian diagnosis of “hysteria”, as an imaginary malady of attention-seeking, fashion-conscious, mainly younger women. Statistically, women are more likely than men to be gluten sensitive: two to three times as many women as men suffer from coeliac disease, going up to six times more for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.Gluten-free diets yield mixed results. One woman I spoke to, who described her symptoms as her stomach “blowing up like a balloon”, gave me this verdict on her experiment. “I lived above a bakery in Paris. Three months of gluten-free torture and denial, but it didn’t work.” But others do see a benefit. In one recent study, researchers concluded: “Participants’ reasons for gluten avoidance in the absence of a medical diagnosis of coeliac disease were, for the most part, reasoned and logical. The vast majority of participants believed that adhering to a gluten-free diet led to improvements.”Even so, we are still encouraged to file the non-coeliac gluten-free regime in the dustbin of baseless celebrity fad diets, to write it off as a 21st-century exercise in mass neurosis. After all, why should grains that we have been eating, apparently without incident, for as long as 14,000 years suddenly become too hard to stomach? Maybe we need to rephrase that question: what is it about the grain-based staples that most of us are eating, that could be causing population-wide digestive difficulties? Or, as the Real Bread Campaign co-founder, Andrew Whitley, says: “We should be asking why the food system has done this to us, asking how it dares to sell us crap that’s made us like this”.What does he mean? For a start, the wheat we are eating has been bred, largely at the behest of industrial bakeries and food manufacturers, to have higher levels of stronger gluten. (The more gluten, the fluffier and more voluminous your loaf.) In the UK, the oldest modern bread wheat cultivar we grow is Maris Widgeon, which dates back to 1964 the rest were developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries for higher yield and higher gluten. These cultivars are not what our ancestors ate. What other unintended mutations might this breeding have caused in these varieties, and what effects might they have on the people who eat them?Our great-grandparents’ grain was not sprayed with pesticides, either. These days, it is common practice among non-organic farmers to spray their wheat on days before harvest with the controversial pesticide glyphosate, to dry off the crop for processing. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies it as a probable human carcinogen. Debate rages about the long-term safety of these pesticides and possible effects on human health, especially when deployed so close to harvesting.In the factory, heavily automated bakery conglomerates have stripped out most of the time, human effort and craftsmanship from the bread-making process, replacing traditional methods with a chemistry set of additives and undisclosed processing aids, notably enzymes synthesised in the laboratory. These enzymes, and the 27 potential allergens that scientists have identified in wheat, are now firmly in the frame for causing “baker’s lung”, an occupational hazard of bakery factory workers. Could they also be affecting the health of their customers in a less dramatic manner? Although all the additives used to make modern bread and processed food products are “generally recognised as safe”, in the circumspect language of the US Food and Drug Administration, some researchers have associated a number of food additives with some of the gut alterations seen in both coeliac and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, as well as in inflammatory bowel disease. For instance, one study found that emulsifiers, a common category of food additive found in industrial breads and baked goods, may promote intestinal inflammation by disrupting the barrier between the immune system and the microbiome – the collection of microbes that inhabit our bodies. The cumulative cocktail effect of modern combinations of additives we eat could also be cause for concern, as the safety of each is only tested in isolation and any possible cocktail effect has not been systematically studied.For the past 20-30 years, industrial bakeries have also been adding extra gluten to their products, known as “vital gluten” in the trade, but often labelled innocuously as “wheat protein”. Consumers are eating more gluten now than ever before. And, in a belt-and-braces strategy to make their goods look as big and as good-value as possible, they have also bumped up the amount of yeast (another known food allergen) in their formulations.Today’s industrial baked goods sound even less like a recipe for digestive comfort when you consider that the most crucial step in traditional bread making – long, slow fermentation – has been stripped largely out of the industrial manufacturing process, making it possible to create finished loaves in two hours, as opposed to the traditional time frame of 16 hours or more. Some experts argue that without this traditional fermentation – the process by which parts of the grain begin to be broken down in the presence of lactic acid bacteria – many people simply can’t digest grains properly to absorb the desirable micronutrients they contain. “We hear time and again from people who have found they can eat one type of loaf but not another,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. “Some people report their trouble is triggered by contemporary strains of modern wheat, while real bread made with heritage varieties are fine. Or perhaps they are limited to eating ancient types of wheat like einkorn, emmer or spelt. Other people have found that the only bread they can enjoy is genuine sourdough, made by a long fermentation process using a live starter sourdough culture.”So, while gluten need not be a digestive disruptor, per se, it could perhaps become so when encountered in its inadequately fermented forms, particularly when it is mixed with pesticide residues, food additives and processing aids that could be troublemakers in their own right. Other possible triggers for gastric difficulties could be Fodmaps, or Fermentable, Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides and Polyols. These sugars are by no means exclusive to gluten-containing foods, but they are naturally rich in them. The thinking here is that it is not necessarily gluten, but badly absorbed Fodmaps that generate symptoms similar to those observed in gluten sensitivity. A Fodmaps diet involves cutting out high Fodmap foods for six to eight weeks before reintroducing them one-by-one, over time, to pin down the culprit(s). The verdict? “Very difficult to do. I don’t know anyone who has stuck to it,” was the anecdotal response I got from one person who tried this.And what about fibre, which is enshrined in government healthy eating guidelines? We are exhorted to eat products made from whole grains, such as those with lots of wheat bran, rather than white refined ones, but, without thorough fermentation to break down whole grains into a digestible form, might the insoluble fibre in such products inflame our guts? A recent scientific review of the effects of dietary fibre on those who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome noted that: “A general recommendation to increase fibre intake in this group of patients would be inappropriate since it could worsen the symptoms.” Yet most of us still assume, because we have been told over and over again, that “brown is best”.People dogged by the spectrum of symptoms labelled as a gluten intolerance turn hopefully, or in desperation, to the burgeoning, highly lucrative larder of gluten-free alternatives that manufacturers have put on our shelves. But relying on gluten-free alternatives could be counterproductive. The vast majority of gluten-free creations touted as “tummy friendly” contain the same questionable enzymes and additives that food technologists use in the standard, gluten-containing industrial equivalent. In addition, they also rely on hi-tech food manufacturing ingredients to provide their architecture. These include xanthan gum, a strong, glue-like substance also used in the oil industry to thicken drilling mud, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, also used in the construction industry for its water-retaining properties in cement, and tapioca starch, a nutritionally depleted, chemically modified starch from the cassava root. Are these items in many gluten-free products a boon for under-par guts, or a prescription for swapping diarrhoea for constipation?The habits of a relatively small number of extreme eaters are one thing, but attempts by many more people to tackle their weight or gastric issues by seeing if they do better on a gluten-free regime, are quite another. And behind them sits an even bigger debate. If an excess of sugar and carbohydrate foods is the real driver of obesity, as is increasingly hypothesised, then all those people cutting out gluten-containing carbs as a sort of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey exercise in tackling spreading thighs and bulging bellies may not be too wide of the mark.Given the troubled state of the nation’s guts and the girth of its waist, our fixation on gluten is unlikely to disappear any time soon, although a rival food fashion trend could be its nemesis. Google searches for “plant-based diet” spiked over the past year, while searches for “gluten-free diet” have gradually declined since a 2012 peak.There is a conflict here. Mapping out a realistic, workable diet free from gluten – or, indeed, Fodmaps – yet big on plants is nothing if not challenging. If, that is, you want to eat a real-food diet and stay as far away from ultra-processed junk as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d86470718a09e7a59c48d1e6c2b62d4d632bd5a/0_73_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32ee53a01f90477ded97daa0a6b75695","title":"support the guardian how to make the most","story":"Over 800,000 of our readers support us financially, and there are a number of advantages to doing so – including getting closer to our journalists and reducing the number of requests you see on our articles supporters help us keep our journalism open for everyone through regular financial contributions, or one-off payments.

Pressure on household finances is easing as wages have begun to outstrip inflation.Although a rebound in prices will dismay those struggling to save money to buy their first home, some estate agents greeted the figures enthusiastically.“Annual growth just exploded to a level not seen since the autumn,” said the London agents James Pendleton.“With two negative quarters behind us, many were hoping the usually busy summer period would produce a bit of a bounce, and this is a promising start.”But Halifax said that transaction activity “remains soft” and that it expected the number of mortgage approvals to be broadly flat during 2018.Economists said the July figures from Halifax should be treated cautiously. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “We remain doubtful the UK housing market is stepping up a gear. Activity is still relatively lacklustre despite coming modestly off 2018 lows, with consumer conditions challenging.”Jonathan Harris of the mortgage broker Anderson Harris said: “We don’t expect this month’s interest rate rise on its own to have too much of an impact. However, it may cause some nervousness going forward as buyers worry about the possibility of future rate rises. It is no surprise then that fixed-rate mortgages continue to be by far the most popular product as borrowers look to protect themselves against future uncertainty.”Brexit uncertainty is likely to keep house price rises restrained, said Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. “The future course of the market is delicately balanced.

But if you’re an Aphex Twin fan, this seems positively ascetic in its simplicity: the Cornish producer sends his fans down labyrinthine rabbit holes full of clues and in-jokes.He has just released his first new material since 2016: the high-tempo stuttering electro groove of T69 Collapse. The first sign of it was the appearance of his rune-like “A” symbol in London’s Elephant and Castle tube station – perhaps a nod to the rumour that he bought up the silvery structure in the middle of the area’s roundabout – followed by the same 3D design printed amid the greenery on a wall of an Los Angeles record shop. Then there was an announcement of sorts, a distorted press release promising an EP called Collapse.An enterprising fan has unpicked and transcribed the document, though we’re not really any the wiser: it bimbles on about “simulated latte-mummies” and declares the EP “a fun water gathering. Apex spread the twin tails and succeeded in his early car … Frolic rating 23!” There was a hint that new music might come “in the middle of the week”, and so it proves: the video, with its glitching street scenes images and mutating lines of text referring to peanut butter, will send fans off on more decryption missions.This is classic Aphex japery. His previous album, Syro, was heralded via a fluorescent blimp appearing over London, followed by an announcement made on the deep web. And for every stunt, there’ll be fans putting in the legwork – or money.When he released tens of demos to his SoundCloud page, fans annotated them in a gloriously nerdy Google Doc, pointing out samples of Eazy-E, Joni Mitchell and the movie Short Circuit, alongside sage observations (“uses the same shaker sound as GirlBoy”)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f9877bb0b8fdfc19f0f00aa77c9999ba8a68fba/0_2_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62371065025a2fa5dfb37cafca67a183","title":"grace jones ghetts glitter the best of bestival 2018","story":"Take a look at the punters and performers who descended on Dorset’s Lulworth Estate for Bestival, including Idles, Songhoy Blues and Chaka Khan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6bbfc740deae5df5fb5c01ea3ffd58faa7ebd4d/0_561_4921_2952/master/4921.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=053f8361ed3f343006364a1073d63cd5","title":"uk run out of food no deal brexit national farmers union","story":"Farmers’ union says supplies would only last until August next year if Britain had to be self-sufficientBritain would run out of food on this date next year if it cannot continue to easily import from the EU and elsewhere after Brexit, the National Farmers’ Union has warned.Minette Batters, the NFU president, urged the government to put food security at the top of the political agenda after the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was talked up this week. “The UK farming sector has the potential to be one of the most impacted sectors from a bad Brexit – a frictionless free trade deal with the EU and access to a reliable and competent workforce for farm businesses is critical to the future of the sector,” she said. Batters’ warning comes a fortnight after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, said Britain would have “adequate food supplies” after Brexit. While Downing Street has insisted it is confident an agreement can be made in time, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, warned over the weekend that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was now at “60-40”, fuelling fears at the NFU and among food importers.In a statement issued by the NFU, Batters expressed concern that Britain would not be able to meet its food needs if Brexit was mismanaged.Research showed 7 August 2019 would be the nominal day that Britain would run out of food if it were asked to be wholly self-sufficient based on seasonal growth, the NFU said. The temperatures of the past few weeks have put Britain’s food production capabilities into sharp focus and underlined concerns. Batters said the consequences of there being no agreement could be mitigated if the government took immediate action and gave domestic production its “unwavering support”. Changing eating habits over the past three decades have helped fuel the increasing reliance on food grown overseas, with perishable items such as tomatoes, lettuce and citrus fruits expected to be available all year round.But global economics have also contributed to imbalances in foods that can be produced in the UK.Britain exports more milk and cream products than it produces, and imports almost three times as much cheese as it exports, almost twice as many eggs and almost 20 times as many fresh vegetables, according to HMRC statistics for 2017.Among the few surplus products are whisky and salmon. The NFU said the figures showed Brexit is an opportunity for British food producers to redress the balance. “The statistics show a concerning long-term decline in the UK’s self-sufficiency in food and there is a lot of potential for this to be reversed,” Batters said. “And while we recognise the need for importing food which can only be produced in different climates, if we maximise on the food that we can produce well in the UK, then that will deliver a whole host of economic, social and environmental benefits to the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c292013a1b9435a50494a2f21a379e06e9d4726/0_279_6292_3777/master/6292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04e719f3be2e1a362e772ef412f59044","title":"increase in uk life spans stalling at one of fastest rates among 20 leading economies","story":"ONS data shows big slowdown in life expectancy improvements for both men and womenThe UK has experienced one of the largest slowdowns in life expectancy growth among 20 of the world’s leading economies, official figures show.For several decades until 2011, life expectancy had been increasing, but since then it has stalled, according to figures published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This year academics demanded an urgent inquiry into whether austerity policies could be behind a stagnation in life expectancy. They accused the government of repeatedly ignoring concerns about a potential link between death rates and underfunding of the NHS and social care.Alan Evans, from the ONS, said: “The slowdown in life expectancy improvements that has been observed in the UK since 2011 is also evident in a number of countries across Europe, North America and Australia. However, the UK has experienced one of the largest slowdowns in life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years for males and females.”The UK experienced steady increases in life expectancy at birth throughout the 20th century. This was attributed to improvements in treating infectious diseases, health improvements in the population as it aged, advances in medical care such as heart disease treatments, and behavioural changes such as a reduction in the rate of smoking in the population.In 2015 there was a sharp increase in the number of deaths, which led to the first reduction in UK life expectancy at birth in the 21st century.The latest ONS figures show that the UK also experienced the greatest slowdown among the 20 countries in life expectancy improvements for both males and females aged 65 years.The other countries examined by the ONS were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

And Gray, who as a senior civil servant was closely involved in the rollout of tax credits under a Labour government, says the potential operational and political risks for universal credit (UC) are huge: “This is where it gets really serious.”If ministers do not heed the lessons of the past few years, the migration process, he reckons, could trigger more strife. As well as the sheer numbers moving on to the new system, they include working people on tax credits who will have to adapt very quickly to a complex and, for many people, less generous new system – and if they don’t, they will face penalties.The mental health charity Mind has already flagged up its concerns that many vulnerable claimants will fall though the net, leaving them without income. Gray says this is a fair observation. Ministers must ensure that proper help for all claimants is in place, properly funded. The current universal support arrangements may not be enough. “My sense is that the jury is still out on whether that is satisfactorily in place, sufficient and effective in different parts of the country.” Yet, for all this, he is optimistic about UC: “I think it is the right broad direction of travel. Frankly, if it needs to take a bit longer, beyond 2023, is that the end of the world? No, I don’t think it is. The important thing is to get to a point where it is working.”Gray gives credit to former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith for his ambition, but the idea that this would be up and running within a single parliament was, he says, “with the benefit of hindsight and possibly foresight too, never going to be doable”.Was there – in the words of the public accounts committee – a “culture of indifference” in the DWP? Gray says it was more, perhaps a “mistaken sense of self-sufficiency”. It must listen more to external voices, to service users and its own frontline. Senior DWP officials, he noted, had been striving in recent years to encourage staff to “speak truth to power”, he says. “Clearly, they haven’t been wholly successful. There is a cultural problem they need to tackle.”In 2014, the SSAC carried out a major consultation on ministers’ proposals to introduce a seven-day waiting period before a claim for benefits could be made. It said that would seriously affect vulnerable claimants – who would have to wait at least six weeks to receive any money – and public expenditure savings would be illusory. Don’t do it, the committee advised.

But what if the answer is to drop out a little?It’s not just anti-anxiety books flying off the shelves. There has also been a substantial increase in demand for depression and anxiety medications in recent years – on both sides of the Atlantic. According to Zion Market Research, the “general anxiety disorder market” is undergoing rapid growth and is expected to generate revenue of $3.7bn by the end of 2020 in the US. Meanwhile, the UK has become the world’s second-largest market, after the US, of illegal online sales of the anti-anxiety medication Xanax.We can blame some of our current angst on the tempestuous US president. “Trump anxiety disorder” is not an official disease, but therapists have started using the term. The clinical psychologist Jennifer Panning coined the phrase in a 2017 essay and the CBC, Canada’s public broadcasting company, recently ran a piece on the phenomenon, describing how American mental-health professionals are reporting “unusually high levels of politics-related stress in their practices.” Nicely trolled, Canada. Nicely trolled. Meanwhile, to throw a little personal anecdata into the mix, my New York doctor told me he saw a spike in patients asking for sleeping pills after Trump was elected.Now, I’m sorry to say this, but we can’t blame Trump for everything that’s wrong in the world – or in our psyches. We are in the grip of an anxiety epidemic that predates his presidency. Indeed, we have become so collectively consternated that a 2016 analysis led by the World Health Organisation estimated that, without more treatment, 12bn working days will be lost because of anxiety each year. The study estimated the cost to the global economy up to 2030 at $925bn.It is jarring that the study framed anxiety as a threat to global productivity, because the imperative to be constantly productive is one of the things that makes me acutely anxious. In a capitalist economy, we are prompted to measure our self-worth by our output. We are constantly told that there is nothing better than being busy success means getting up at 5am, punishing ourselves at the gym and then producing, producing, producing. I\u0026nbsphave frequent anxiety attacks where I feel as if I’m not doing enough, achieving enough, earning enough, etc. I have to constantly remind myself that it is important to take time out. In a world which urges constant activity, it’s important to do nothing occasionally.The big lie that the burgeoning anxiety industry sells is that we all, inidually, have the power to fix our problems. That if we buy the right book or take the right pills we will be able to quiet our worries and feel better. It is certainly true that the right books and the right pills can help. But there isn’t enough acknowledgment that the reason we have entered an “age of anxiety” is structural. It would be bizarre if most of us, particularly millennials, weren’t anxious: inequality is skyrocketing, the job market is becoming more precarious and house prices are increasingly out of reach. Add in political instability and there is a lot to worry about. The one thing you shouldn’t worry about, however, is that you are the only one feeling anxious.Using a plastic straw these days is basically akin to walking around with a sign saying: “I love stabbing baby turtles in the nostril.” In today’s anti-straw environment, there is no faster way to demonstrate that you are the sea life-murdering spawn of Satan than sipping your artisanal iced coffee with a single-use piece of plastic.Listen, I know very well that they are evil and unrecyclable, but the inconvenient truth is that plastics straws are great. Sure, they may kill innocent sea turtles, but they don’t turn to mush in your mouth like their paper equivalents, which are an abomination. And please don’t tell me I should just drink with my mouth that’s disgusting.At the risk of sounding like one of those unhinged rightwingers who has developed a bizarre passion for straws in an attempt to “own the libs”, I feel compelled to announce that I find this witch-hunt against straws incredibly irritating. One of my main bugbears is the way it has become a smug form of virtue-signaling. Shunning plastic straws is 2018’s answer to the reusable water bottle, which has become something of a status symbol among young people. There is nothing wrong with showing that you care about the environment, of course – that should be applauded. It’s just that the amount of attention the anti-straw movement has garnered seems disproportionate they are literally a drop in our plastic-filled oceans. Further, getting rid of straws is a convenient way for polluting companies to make themselves look good without really changing or jeopardising their bottom line.But it’s too late for straw-truthers like me. The tide has turned. The anti-straw industrial complex will not be stopped. The only thing one can really do now is suck it up.I recently met a sweet little dachshund in the park. “What’s he called?” I asked the attendant human. “Alan,” the owner said blithely. “Oh, how nice!” I replied.Obviously, I didn’t mean that. It should be illegal to call your dachshund Alan. Not that I have anything against Alans it’s a perfectly good name for a retired footballer. It just isn’t suitable for a cute canine. Dogs should have sensible names such as Rascal and Spot. Ever since my Alan encounter, though, I seem to keep meeting dogs with human names and I’m finding it very unsettling. Call it my pet peeve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98dd85ceb992cbc181b21e13f90b516928c287ad/6_0_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bc7e68c29fb877994337971e420b97a","title":"clare in the community shady figures","story":"Clare and Megan loom large in a homeless man’s story"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/006f7261d407e958c5d61fe840d02801c25316eb/48_43_3380_2028/master/3380.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=347503057af1ff9febf0fd9c7293d5b7","title":"ollie pope england india lords test","story":"• Surrey batsman almost certain to face India at Lord’s• ‘Way Sam Curran played can give me confidence,’ says PopeOllie Pope is confident he can follow his Surrey teammate Sam Curran and make a smooth transition to the Test arena.Pope looks certain to make his England debut in the second Test against India on Thursday, replacing the dropped Dawid Malan. His call-up to the squad came after only 15 first-class matches but the national selector, Ed Smith, has been won over by the glut of stylish runs the 20-year-old has scored this season.That age and inexperience should not act as a barrier was demonstrated at Edgbaston last week when Curran, more than four months younger than his county colleague, announced himself with a man-of-the-match showing in the series-opening win.“The way he played last week can give me confidence to know I can do it,” Pope said. “I’ve played with him since we were 14, 15 – as soon as he came over from Zimbabwe – and we’ve gone down the same path.“I’ve had a good season so far. I have confidence in my own game to take the next step. You hear stories of some of the greats of the game, people like Alastair Cook. I think he was 20 when he made his debut, so it’s not like it hasn’t been done before. Hopefully I take my chance.”Barring an unexpected tactical switch Pope will bat at No 4 at Lord’s, despite regularly coming in two places lower for his county. Asked if he would take on the challenge, he said: “If required, yes. Especially against this India side, where they bowl a lot of spin. It’s not massively different. When I bat at six sometimes I’ve been in the 10th over, other times I’m in for the second new ball. In the four-to-six region I don’t think there’s a massive difference in the way you play.”Pope does not expect to be overawed by the occasion, with social media giving him time to get used to the idea and experience of playing at the home of cricket helping settle any nerves. “I read a few articles I got tagged in on Twitter … I clicked on them out of curiosity and I took them in,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a41a241f26e5ea8be8d71e2296d1f82f1269b88/0_114_4643_2786/master/4643.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=228b097ef07e42d4620de784f0faa6ee","title":"uspga broadcasting rights","story":"How golf can appeal to a broader and younger market has been the subject of much discussion. This week, the biggest departure yet from traditional broadcast models will occur when Eleven Sports takes control of UK coverage for the final major of 2018, the US PGA Championship.The tournament will be available via an online stream and on Facebook, all controlled by the media company which has made interesting inroads into territory once controlled by Sky Sports and BT Sport. It is unclear whether Eleven Sports, which is understood to have paid seven figures for coverage from Bellerive, has a long-term plan for showing the major, which will switch to a May date from next year.“Launching Eleven Sports in the UK and Ireland with such a prestigious event as the 100th PGA Championship confirms our position as a major player in the market,” said Danny Menken, the group managing director of Eleven Sports.Today Eleven Sports launched its service: the first two US PGA rounds only are streamed free of charge on Facebook to get the final two rounds, viewers have to sign up for a seven-day trial for its monthly pass (priced at £5.99).The route by which the PGA of America got to this point is fascinating. As is the imminent departure of the head of that organisation, Pete Bevacqua, to become the head of NBC Sports. The US PGA has apparently dropped well down the pecking order when it comes to sought-after sports events to broadcast in the UK.A little over a year ago, talks broke down between PGA of America officials and Sky. IMG, which negotiates in the UK on the PGA of America’s behalf, duly cut a last-ditch deal with the BBC to show the action from Quail Hollow. The corporation was widely criticised for its hastily-arranged output but the point was, unlike this time, a TV platform existed.Optimists will suggest Eleven Sports and a move into modern coverage domains will assist golf’s profile. Perhaps a younger audience will be attracted from Thursday, as Justin Thomas seeks to defend his title. Nonetheless, it is inevitable that grumbles will emerge from a market more accustomed to switching a television on.The Open’s move from the BBC to Sky in 2016 resulted in fierce criticism of the R\u0026ampA. Office bearers at St Andrews argued, with a degree of legitimacy, that participation in the game was declining even when the oldest major was available on a terrestrial outlet. Commercially, the Sky deal made perfect sense.A new deal between Sky, which has a dedicated golf channel, and the European Tour is imminent. How that impacts on the Ryder Cup, controlled by the European Tour and PGA of America, remains to be seen, as does what Eleven Sports brings to the table."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3648153dd625edf9998ee44ecad687205e2fe0ca/113_36_3259_1955/master/3259.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e27e8bd353cefd894e55e4b23ce2ca95","title":"lost voice guy review lee ridley britains got talent edinburgh gilded balloon","story":"Gilded Balloon, EdinburghBritain’s Got Talent winner Lee Ridley combines the political and personal with razor-sharp observations about disability‘If you expect me to be that sweet and innocent tonight, you’re in a for a big surprise.” And so Lee Ridley greets his audience – those wooed by his winning stint as Lost Voice Guy on the recent run of Britain’s Got Talent – in a tiny garret room at the Edinburgh fringe, booked before fame came calling. His new show, Inspiration Porn, is more political – and more vulnerable – than anything you would expect to see on the same TV programme as Simon Cowell. It is a distinctive mix of barbed disability comedy and the kind of self-mocking humour that Hannah Gadsby, with her Netflix hit Nanette, has recast in a troubling new light.There were times, in other words, that I felt saddened by how ruthless Ridley is with himself onstage – his disability (Ridley has cerebral palsy and is unable to speak), supposed unattractiveness and low self-esteem. But that is his prerogative, and certainly fits with his show’s rejection of the inspirational rhetoric that surrounds high-achieving disabled people. In the “posh old man” tones of his voice synthesiser – the unorthodox comic timing takes some adjusting to – he contrasts inspirational quotes and “yes we can” Paralympic mottos with the realities of his own life: lazy, lonely, he tells us, and “shit at everything”.The entwining of private and political is adroitly done. Ridley’s call-to-arms to fight, not for heroic inidual success a la Britain’s Got Talent, but for social justice is – irony of ironies – inspiring. I flinched occasionally from the self-lacerating humour, and one or two routines (such as the Play Your Crips Right card game, the logic of which is jumbled) need work. But it’s undeniably a striking set by a comic who, if he’s missing a voice, certainly isn’t short of something to say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b1b0c202bb9592143eb4067ad65c6ff44c1f4e/0_0_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2f801418d10bc2e51395a1dbd7c39b","title":"android 9 pie google new mobile os everything you need to know","story":"Google’s new mobile OS is rolling out to a select group of phones. Here’s the lowdown on the new featuresGoogle’s next version of Android finally has a name: “Pie”. It’s rolling out right now and is packed with new features, from extended battery life to new gesture navigation.Pie marks one of the biggest changes in the way Android looks and feels in some years, with a more colourful interface, a collection of new movement animations and rounded edges on almost everything. Thankfully, it’s still as fast as Android Oreo, at least on Google’s Pixel smartphones.Right now, if you have one of the recent Google Pixel smartphones or the Essential Phone via an over-the-air update. Either wait for the notification to update or head to Settings \u0026gt System \u0026gt Advanced \u0026gt System update and hit the “Check for update” button.Others will have to wait for their smartphone manufacturer to deliver the update. Those with phones such as the OnePlus 6 that were included in the Android P beta programme over the last couple of months will probably see the update soon. Those with Samsung, Huawei or other mainstream manufacturer devices may have to wait some time to see the update on their phones.Android 9 Pie is a free update for eligible devices – if you are ever asked to pay for Android updates, someone is trying to con you.Google has introduced the biggest change to the way you get around in Android since the traditional three buttons of home, back and overview (recently used apps).The new gesture navigation button occupies the same space as the traditional on-screen buttons, but the home button is now a pill-shape and it moves.Tap it to go home, flick it up to see recently used apps, swipe upwards twice or pull it up further to get to the app drawer, or hold it down to activate Google Assistant. Youcan also drag it to the right to switch to the last app (similar to the double tap of the overview button) or drag and hold to cycle through recently used apps.The back button still appears when needed, but the overview button has gone.The gestures are not activated by default for now, which means to try them out head to Settings \u0026gt System \u0026gt Gestures and toggle the “Swipe up on Home button” option.It’s a small change, but arguably the most useful. Now when you have rotation lock turned on to stop the screen rotating orientation accidentally, and you turn on your phone intentionally, a little button appears in the navigation bar.Tap the button to rotate the screen from portrait to landscape or vice versa – perfect for those few times that you actually want the screen to rotate but not, say, when you’re lying down in bed.Android 9 Pie has moved the time from the top right of the status bar to the top left. It may not seem the most dramatic of changes, but it makes room for screen cutouts called “notches”, as found on the OnePlus 6 and Huawei P20 Pro, among others.Google has decreed that only two notches may be used on one screen for it to be able to run its version of Android, so at least you won’t have to deal with one in each side of the screen.Short of navigation gestures, Adaptive Battery is the biggest improvement to Android. Using systems developed by Alphabet’s AI-outfit DeepMind, Adaptive Battery learns an inidual’s usage patterns and directs the power to only the apps you need at the time you need them for more predictable day-to-day battery life.AI has also been integrated into Android Pie’s brightness control, so it will now learn from your manual adjustments – something you could be forgiven for thinking already happened.Smart replies have been in several apps for a while, including Gmail and Google’s dedicated Smart Reply app. But now they’ll be pushed to more apps and accessible directly from the notifications for easy, one-button replies.App actions is another AI-integration attempt by Google, which seeks to predict not only the app that you want at any particular moment, but an action from within that app too. For example, I normally play my Discover Weekly playlist from Spotify in the mornings, so when I open the app drawer at about 8am it’s right there as a suggestion for one-tap access.Apple’s iOS has had a magnifying glass for text selection for ages – now Android does too. Tapping on a bit of text still selects it, but when you drag one of the text selection handles you now see a magnified box appear immediately above your finger to make fine grain selection easier, particularly with tiny text.Google is revamping the way Android handles background apps to better protect user privacy. Starting with Android P, apps given permission for location, the microphone, camera and network status will no longer be able to access them when idle in the background. This means it will be harder for rogue apps to spy on users without their knowledge.The changes follow a recent tightening of control over the running of apps that were made with Android Nougat and Android Oreo, primarily to prolong battery life and performance.While Android 9 Pie has been released, not all the features shown off by Google at its developer conference in May are fully baked yet. Two big new features have yet to arrive: Slices and Google’s Digital Wellbeing tools. Expect them to materialise in the Autumn for Google’s Pixel devices and later for other smartphones.Slices displays information from apps directly within the Google search app, in a similar manner to the way Google displays snippets of information within boxes directly in web search results.Examples include showing photos taken in Bali from Google Photos, when searching for Bali, or live prices and times to get you home from Lyft when searching for the app.Google’s anti-smartphone addiction tools, collectively called “Digital Wellbeing”, are currently in beta testing for a select number of users. They include Dashboard, which shows you how much time you’re spending on your phone and in apps App Timer, which allows you to set time limits for certain apps a beefed up Do Not Distrurb (DnD) function that silences both visual and audible alerts and Wind Down, which switches on DnD and fades the screen to grayscale as bedtime approaches.To sign up for the beta on a Google Pixel smartphone running Android 9 Pie, go here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218757c7e599498128689c59d0e46301520843aa/0_355_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abee9a0031700c19056a165472cbee79","title":"internet use record level britons lax about web security","story":"Internet use in Britain has risen to record levels but there is a worrying lack of awareness around security, figures show.The ONS said: “This could potentially become a concern in the future due to lack of awareness surrounding the importance of security installation.”Bill Buchanan, a professor of computing at Edinburgh Napier University, said: “The mobile phone is the danger for us. When you’re at home, you’re behind a firewall, you’re fairly well protected. There’s a much greater risk with a phone.“With a mobile phone, someone can be tracking your location and they can even be turning on your camera or location tracker.“You can track someone from birth to death these days and have a record of every minute of their life through Google searches. That’s pretty sensitive information and we have to understand that Google has that information.”He said phone users were trusting Apple and Google not to provide their information to others.He warned that people were much more likely to fall for phishing emails and fake websites on a phone, where checking authenticity was not as easy.“It’s difficult to create the security you would get on a desktop because you’re not in a constrained space,” he said. “What you really need is something that learns about you, what you like and don’t like, and what looks suspicious.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eb3a51cd077b31cf6b5eb9c1edf77d54f59d48e/0_34_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a88c9fb8b09c254d4847a3ef6649df41","title":"manafort trial latest rick gates defence lawyers question","story":"Defence to question Gates’s motives for testifying against former boss and sow doubts in the jury’s mind over whether anything he says can be trustedLawyers are expected to tear into the credibility of the star witness at the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Tuesday – and potentially deal a blow to special counsel Robert Mueller.Rick Gates, a longtime deputy to Manafort who is cooperating with prosecutors, is likely to face withering cross-examination by the defence team in a case that represents the first court test for the Mueller investigation into 2016 election interference and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow.In early testimony on Tuesday, Gates related his role in setting up offshore bank accounts for Manafort, a complex arrangement that was requested by wealthy and powerful Ukrainian businessmen who bankrolled Manafort’s political consulting work in the country.Manafort’s defence team has already portrayed Gates as a liar and cheat who “had his hand in the cookie jar” when he worked for Manafort, who is on trial for bank fraud and tax evasion. They now appear set to question him about his motives for testifying against his former boss in a bid to sow doubts in the jury’s mind over whether anything he says can be trusted.Gates’s admissions from the witness stand on Monday that he failed to report income he routed through his bank accounts in the UK, and embezzled several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort by filing false and inflated expense reports, look certain to come under scrutiny. Although the allegations of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia are not at issue in this trial, any significant blows to the government’s case are likely be seized on by the president’s defenders, including conservative media, to support his contention that Mueller’s investigation is a “rigged witch hunt”.The judge, T S Ellis III, has already questioned the prosecution’s motives for bring the case against Manafort, 69, a political consultant and lobbyist. “You don’t really care about Mr Manafort’s bank fraud,” he said at a hearing in May. “You really care about getting information Mr Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment.”Ellis has maintained the irascible tone since the trial got under way last week in Alexandria, Virginia. He has pushed prosecutors to move faster and stay relevant. On Monday he criticised prosecutor Greg Andres for avoiding eye contact with him, saying, “Look at me,” and suggesting that Andres “looked down as if to say, ‘That’s BS.’ ”Gates pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence. On Monday, he testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts. He was aware that Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine, he said.Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. His defence team is seeking to pin the blame on Gates, whom they say was responsible for day-to-day operations of the business. “The foundation of the special counsel’s case against Paul Manafort rests squarely on the shoulders of this one person,” they said last week.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98465a8b70d885360692b4c9e997ccae6503eef5/0_51_2421_1453/master/2421.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09b684473e78471eafda78d81ede3654","title":"iran braces for new round of us economic sanctions","story":"‘Most biting ever’ sanctions imposed overnight as President Rouhani dismisses ‘psychological warfare’ Donald Trump has warned America’s trading partners that anyone who does business with Iran will not be doing business with the US, after his administration reimposed blanket sanctions.The US president described the new sanctions, which hit Iran’s access to dollars, gold and precious metals, as “the most biting ever imposed”. “In November they ratchet up to yet another level,” he tweeted. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!”Within hours of the sanctions taking effect, the German carmaker Daimler, which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, said it was halting its business activities in the country.The punitive measures came into force in the early hours of Tuesday, and follow Trump’s decision in May to renege on the landmark 2015 deal to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The sanctions also target a range of industries, including Iran’s carmaking sector, and will be followed by a set of additional and even more stringent measures by 4 November, including an embargo on the import of Iranian oil and sanctions on its banking sector. Trump’s latest comments appear aimed at the EU, which is attempting to protect European businesses from the sanctions and has vowed to safeguard firms. Companies have been instructed that they should not comply with demands from the White House for them to drop all business with Iran. Those who decide to pull out because of US sanctions will need to be granted authorisation from the European commission, without which they face the risk of being sued by EU member states.“This morning the EU’s updated ‘blocking statute’ entered into force to mitigate the impact of the reimposed US sanctions on the interests of EU companies doing legitimate business in Iran,” a European commission spokesman said.The UK Foreign Office minister Alastair Burt told the BBC that the “Americans have really not got this right”. He said it was a commercial decision for companies whether to stay in Iran, but that Britain believed the nuclear deal was important “not only to the region’s security but the world’s security”.The Trump administration said on Monday it was not particularly concerned by the EU decision and that the US strategy was designed to apply maximum pressure on Tehran. Ultimately, the US administration wants a new deal that it says will address “the totality of the Iranian threat”.Iranians have been anxious about the return of sanctions, which will compound the country’s economic woes. Its currency has been sent into a tailspin in recent months, fuelling street protests over economic grievances, a lack of social and political freedoms, and growing environmental challenges. Some analysts fear the country is on an economic and political precipice.“There’s a sense of anguish in Iranian society – everyone is worried and waiting,” said Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of politics at Tehran University.“There is no hope that the situation will get better. People think that in the best-case scenario, it won’t get worse. Among the youth you see a huge tendency to leave the country,” he said.They are going to be such a wealthy, such a powerful nation, they\u0027re going to have nuclear weapons, the Republican presidential frontrunner says. They are going to take over parts of the world that you wouldn\u0027t believe and I think it\u0027s going to lead to nuclear holocaust.\u0026nbspTrump says his number one priority is to dismantle the nuclear agreement. This deal is catastrophic for Israel, for America, for the whole of the Middle East, he says.The White House signals a tougher stance towards Iran, condemning a recent missile test and declaring America is putting the Islamic republic on notice following its malign actions. Trump tweets: Iran is playing with fire – they don\u0027t appreciate how \u0027kind\u0027 President Obama was to them. Not me!Trump calls on all countries to isolate Iran, in a speech in Riyadh. From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region, he declares.Trump says the nuclear accord is an embarrassment to the United States. He tells the UN general assembly that Iran\u0027s government turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state.Trump says it is time for change in Iran, after days of deadly protests against the government in Tehran. A day later he denounces the brutal and corrupt regime.Trump pulls the US out of the nuclear pact. Describing the deal as defective at its core, he says: Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.Iran\u0027s president, Hassan Rouhani, tells the US it should not play with the lion\u0027s tail and warns that any conflict with Iran would be the mother of all wars. Trump responds with an all-caps Twitter tirade: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.Trump says he is open to a new Iran deal, while confirming a return to sanctions. I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime\u0027s malign activities, including its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism, he says in a statement.On Monday night, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, dismissed the new round of sanctions as “psychological warfare” designed to help Trump’s allies in the upcoming mid-term elections.He reassured Iranians that his government was able to stave off pressure from the US, but said it was only possible if different factions within the country showed unity. “Our system is stable, we’re all standing together,” he said. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Monday that enemies were pulling out all the stops to target “Iran’s existence”, pledging that his country “will overcome this period of hardship”. The head of the German Association of Chambers of Commerce said German businesses were already “in retreat” from Iran amid fears that legal banking channels between the countries were crumbling under US pressure.“It’s important that the EU and the German government work to find funding channels,” said Martin Wansleben, who speaks for more than 3 million German entrepreneurs, in a statement. “As well as the financial damage there is also the threat of losing trust in Iran.”Last week the US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, persuaded the German government to stop a cash transfer of €300m (£268m) from Hamburg to Tehran via the Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank.Rouhani’s administration is scrambling to mitigate the impact of sanctions and their effect on the plummeting value of the national currency by easing foreign exchange rules.Internally, many prominent Iranians believe the pressure from the US is mainly intended to provoke regime change. The reformist ex-president Mohammad Khatami, one of the most popular politicians inside Iran but who is currently sidelined, was quoted by local media as saying that efforts to engineer regime change would prove futile so long as people believed in reform. Khatami has set out 15 suggestions to Iranian leaders to bring the country out of the political deadlock. His suggestions include the release of all political prisoners, and establishment of a free atmosphere for political activities.

The other 300 would be released soon, he said.Gbagbo was also tried for crimes against humanity and war crimes, but was acquitted last March. Although the international criminal court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against her, Ivorian authorities refused to hand her over, and her trial in Abidjan was boycotted by victims’ groups who said there were doubts about its credibility. Human rights groups criticised her acquittal, saying serious questions about her alleged role in brutal crimes had gone unanswered, showing how important the ICC case against her was.The former ministers Moise Lida Kouassi and Assoa Adou, and Kamagaté Souleymane, who was a rebel when Laurent Gbagbo was in power, will also be freed under the amnesty, which appeared to be an effort to assuage political tension ahead of the 2020 election. Ouattara recently said he was free to run again in that poll despite having already served two terms, as the constitution had been changed.“This is an act of mercy from the whole nation towards her sons and daughters,” the president said. “I invite all those who benefit from this amnesty to ensure that our country never again has to go through events like those and never again sinks into violence.”Gbagbo was delighted, her lawyer told the magazine Jeune Afrique, and expected to be released later this week.Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede the presidential election to Ouattara in November 2010, setting off four months of fighting in which 3,000 people died. He was finally ejected from his bunker at the presidential palace in April 2011 and was paraded wearing a Hawaiian shirt and a hurt expression, alongside his wife, in a bedroom of Abidjan’s Hotel du Golf.He is on trial at the ICC in The Hague for crimes against humanity including murder, rape and persecution. The prosecution rested its case against him in January after calling 82 witnesses the defence has not yet started its case, but Gbagbo’s lawyer has urged the court to dismiss the case and release him. The next court hearing will be on 1 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05eaaaa5462729f87af14fc85dafd9231eb13eb8/0_162_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46da960362d1b1a368149667ab46a068","title":"texas student makenzie noland alligator photo viral","story":"Makenzie Noland’s pose with 14ft Big Tex has become an internet sensationMakenzie Noland, a Texas student, poses for her graduation photo in cap, sash and – somewhat unusually – with an alligator.The student shared the image on Facebook and Instagram with the caption “not your typical graduation photo”, and found herself at the centre of the internet’s attention.“I am overwhelmed with how viral my post has gotten,” she posted on Tuesday, “and to see everyone from my hometown pushing me to move forward and supporting me is truly incredible”.Noland is graduating from Texas A\u0026ampM University with a major in wildlife ecology. She had been interning at Gator Country, where she met Big Tex, who at 13ft 8.5in (4.18 metres) is the largest alligator at the Beaumont-based rescue centre. The student, originally from Bellevue in Nebraska, said Tex was adopted by the centre a couple of years ago. According to her social media posts, the animal, who can be fussy about who feeds him, first let Noland do so back in May and they have now become friends.“I get in the water with that animal every day,” she said, adding that she also tickled his nose before feeding him. “Every single time I get in the water with him, I realise how huge he is. He’s a real-life dinosaur.”The rescue centre is owned by Arlie Hammonds and Gary Saurage and claims to be the largest alligator sanctuary in south-east Texas, home to more than 450 alligators, crocodiles and other reptiles. The student’s photos have been better received than another alligator-related stunt from earlier this year. In March, Melody Kliebert posted a gender-reveal video, which showed an alligator biting into a watermelon to show a blue colour and, with that, the news that she was expecting a boy. The Klieberts run an alligator farm, and countered criticism of the video by saying there were several trained alligator handlers available. The video has had more than 10m views on Facebook since it was first posted."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Eir, Three, Sky, Tesco Mobile, Virgin Media and VodafoneAugust, 1928: \u0026lsquoMay I draw attention to the urgent need for better bathing places for ladies near Dublin, and particularly at Dalkey?\u0026rsquoGroup now pressing for fresh inquests into the deaths of 48 people in 1981 Artane blaze39 per cent of young people contacting Jigsaw last year reported problems with anxietyBusy weekend for rescue services as woman also airlifted to hospital after fall in Dalkey quarry\u0026euro3 million of \u0026euro18 million needed to make \u0026lsquoSgt Stubby: An Unlikely Hero\u0026rsquo was raised in CorkThird-level institutions will need to meet minimum standards of response to sexual harassment on campusDisciplinary sanctions may still be imposed, says GsocEurostat finds gas prices in Ireland second highest in EU while Irish electricity prices are fourth highest in EUSupport group expresses deep dispappointment at judge\u0026rsquos decision to make man ward of court\u0026lsquoWe knew from how the locals were reacting that this was a scary situation\u0026rsquoMore than two-thirds of students do not agree 28 units inhibits sexual consent \u0026ndash studyWhile plan is now open to public consultation the Taoiseach says it will go aheadMary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor troubled by student survey resultsAmbassador says 50 Irish holidaymakers believed to have left Gili Islands off coast of LombokUS architects chosen for \u0026euro48 million creative design centre at Belfield campusNUI Galway research shows majority of students find sex education unsatisfactoryChurch has pattern of withholding relevant documents from Irish State abuse inquiriesMary McAleese called event \u0026lsquoone of the most devastating moments in my presidency\u0026rsquoOf 110 drivers stopped at Garda checkpoint, 26 thought to be linked to sham marriages"},{"url":null,"title":"a day of celebration and singing as women s hockey team are welcomed home","story":"  August 6, 2018Tears as Minister for Sport announces \u0026euro1.5 million in extra funding for teams preparing for the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020   August 6, 2018Team greeted with a joyous and emotional homecoming as sights now set on Olympics   August 7, 2018Minister says an additional \u0026euro1.5m is to be allocated to high performance teams   August 6, 2018Losing World Cup final to superior Netherlands team has not shaken their self-belief "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584276.1533214652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"united ireland the south of ireland doesn t want us and can t afford us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister Peter Robinson at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties. Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3588837.1533651462!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tokyo medical school altered exam scores to limit female students","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTokyo Medical University manipulated entrance exam results since at least 2000. Photograph: Ayaka AizawaKyodo News APA Tokyo medical school has apologised after an internal investigation confirmed it systematically altered entrance exam scores to limit the number of female students.Tokyo Medical University manipulated all entrance exam results starting in 2000 or even earlier, according to findings released by lawyers involved in the investigation.The school said the manipulation should not have occurred and would not in the future, and it will consider retroactively admitting those who otherwise would have passed the exams.The manipulation was revealed during an investigation of the alleged wrongful admission of a bureaucrat’s son in exchange for favourable treatment for the school in a ministry project. The bureaucrat and the former head of the school have been charged with bribery.The investigation found that last year the school reduced all applicants’ first-stage test scores by 20 per cent and then added up to 20 points for male applicants, and that similar manipulations had taken place for years.It said the school wanted fewer female doctors because it anticipated they would shorten or halt their careers after becoming mothers.“We sincerely apologise for the serious wrongdoing involving entrance exams that has caused concern and trouble for many people and betrayed the public’s trust,” school managing director Tetsuo Yukioka said.He denied any previous knowledge of the score manipulation and said he was never involved.“I suspect that there was a lack of sensitivity to the rules of modern society, in which women should not be treated differently because of their gender,” he said.Mr Yukioka said women were not treated differently once they were accepted, but acknowledged that some people even believed women were not allowed to become surgeons.Women also are considered responsible for homemaking, childrearing and elderly care, while men are expected to work long hours and outside care services are limited. – AP"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.More than £60,000 of taxpayers\u0026#39 money spent on compensating staff and visitors injured in ParliamentCar smashes into crashed vehicle on Toronto highwayBen Stokes mocked by two gay men for his gold-encrusted shoes moments before he knocked out two clubbers, court hearsMourners warned against spreading the ashes of loved ones on Mount Snowdon as it is damaging the wildlifeUK bottom of league table for life expectancy gains Superyacht seized over alleged links to financial scandal that helped topple government arrives in MalaysiaPolice hunt masked men who \u0026#39set fire to ten cars\u0026#39 at Birmingham PrisonExclusive: Family holiday ruined after low-cost airline scrapped flights but didn\u0026#39t tell passengersNew US sanctions will make it harder to keep a lid on a growing uprising threatening Iran\u0026#39s rulersGorilla statue on crazy golf course invades people\u0026#39s privacy by looking into homes, residents sayTimmy Mallett enlists fans in quest for stolen bikeBoy, seven, dies in Deptford house fire being treated by police as arsonMan used eBay car tracker to follow ex-girlfriend who was having relationship with woman, court hearsHeartbreaking picture of girl cuddling her boyfriend in hospital before his life support machine is switched offOutrage as cafe in Venice charges £38 for water and two coffeesTom Daley to explore surrogacy for new BBC One filmSeat sensors on trains will end scramble for spare places, railway firm announcesAustralia presses North Korea to return remains of 43 missing Korean War deadDonald Trump says he\u0026#39s \u0026#39asking for world peace, nothing less\u0026#39 as he warns against trade with IranWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

In the previous six years, it had increased by ten weeks annually.Life expectancy for men of this age rose by three and a half weeks per year - compared with a 12 week annual boost achieved over the previous six years.In both cases, the UK figures for 2011 to 2016 showed the least improvement among all the countries tracked.And in some parts of Britain, mortality fell, with falling female mortality in Wales between 2011 and 2016.The UK has seen the largest slowdown in female life expectancyThe statistics also show a dramatic drop in the increase in life expectancy at birth, with only the US faring worse. Improvements in female life expectancy dropped by 90 per cent, with a 75 per cent drop for men.The average gain of just 1.5 weeks for men a year and 1.2 weeks for women a year in the UK compares to an average annual boost of 10.4 weeks for men and of 6.7 weeks a year for women across all the countries.The ONS said some of the the UK’s recent drop was due to a relatively large increase in male life expectancy from 2001 to 2011.Only the USA has seen a greater slowdown in male life expectancyAlan Evans, from the ONS, said: “The slowdown in life expectancy improvements that has been observed in the UK since 2011, is also evident in a number of countries across Europe, North America and Australia. However, the UK has experienced one of the largest slowdowns in life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years for males and females.”A man of 65 can expect to live to 83 and a half on average, with life expectancy of almost 86 for women.Sir Steve Webb, former Liberal Democrat pensions minister and director of policy at Royal London, said: The UK has slumped from being one of the strongest performers when it comes to improving life expectancy to bottom of the league.There is a real human cost behind these statistics and we urgently need to understand more about why this is happening.He added: The Government needs to conduct urgent research into these worrying trends.If other countries can ride out the economic storms and continue to drive up life expectancy, there is no reason why the UK should not be able to do so.Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, said: “It’s deeply depressing that the rise in life expectancy among the over-65s in the UK is faltering and that we’re falling behind most other developed countries in this crucial respect. It’s hard to attribute precise cause and effect, but the fact we are seeing this trend at the same time as our health and care services are under such acute strain is surely more than a coincidence.“The Government has recently announced a 10 year bonus for the NHS but continues to look the other way as our care system effectively disintegrates, leaving well over a million older people with some unmet need for care,” she said.Life expectancy growth is slowing in the UK, especially for womenProf Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health, London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, called for further investigation of the trends to see if they were the “consequences of austerity”.Justin Madders, shadow health minister, said: “This slowdown in improvements in life expectancy exposes the terrible effects of austerity policies imposed by the Government since 2010.“It is simply astonishing that the UK is now falling so far behind other countries. It is an appalling sign of the Government’s failure to improve people’s life chances as years of underfunding in health and social care take their toll.”A look at longevity | Could ageing make us happy?Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Dementia is the leading cause of death across the UK and we’ve continued to see the number of people dying from the condition rise in recent years.  The slowing in life expectancy gains reflects this trend and emphasises the need for research into finding a way to prevent, slow down or cure the diseases that cause dementia.“Despite disturbing trends in dementia death rates and slowing life expectancy, dementia has been absent from leading health priorities for the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England.  We must see a greater emphasis from government on funding research into dementia if we are to enable people to live in good health as they grow older.”Why is the NHS under so much pressure?London School of Hygiene and Tropical MedicineMore than £60,000 of taxpayers\u0026#39 money spent on compensating staff and visitors injured in ParliamentCar smashes into crashed vehicle on Toronto highwayBen Stokes mocked by two gay men for his gold-encrusted shoes moments before he knocked out two clubbers, court hearsMourners warned against spreading the ashes of loved ones on Mount Snowdon as it is damaging the wildlifeSuperyacht seized over alleged links to financial scandal that helped topple government arrives in MalaysiaPolice hunt masked men who \u0026#39set fire to ten cars\u0026#39 at Birmingham PrisonExclusive: Family holiday ruined after low-cost airline scrapped flights but didn\u0026#39t tell passengersNew US sanctions will make it harder to keep a lid on a growing uprising threatening Iran\u0026#39s rulersGorilla statue on crazy golf course invades people\u0026#39s privacy by looking into homes, residents sayTimmy Mallett enlists fans in quest for stolen bikeBoy, seven, dies in Deptford house fire being treated by police as arsonMan used eBay car tracker to follow ex-girlfriend who was having relationship with woman, court hearsHeartbreaking picture of girl cuddling her boyfriend in hospital before his life support machine is switched offOutrage as cafe in Venice charges £38 for water and two coffeesTom Daley to explore surrogacy for new BBC One filmSeat sensors on trains will end scramble for spare places, railway firm announcesAustralia presses North Korea to return remains of 43 missing Korean War deadDonald Trump says he\u0026#39s \u0026#39asking for world peace, nothing less\u0026#39 as he warns against trade with IranWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/07/TELEMMGLPICT000015744428_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7NWSlvj5xK-VJ52RSuuRgZw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"yes allbright club women doesnt mean cant have man top","story":"Allan Leighton has been appointed non-executive chairman of the all-female club AllbrightAllBright is a business, member’s club and academy focused on building networks and skills for smart minded women.

Now it\u0027s smarter, faster and adapts as you use it.The aim of the AI is to provide a tailored experience to the user, with the operating system learning the user\u0027s preferences over time.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve built Android 9 to learn from you – and work better for you – the more you use it, Sameer Samat, vice president of product management at Android, said in a blog post.\u0026nbspFrom predicting your next task so you can jump right into the action you want to take, to prioritising battery power for the apps you use most, to helping you disconnect from your phone at the end of the day, Android 9 adapts to your life and the ways you like to use your phone.To help people disconnect from their device, Android Pie includes tools for digital wellbeing, which aims to limit people\u0027s time spent using their smartphone.

It’s time that Brussels demonstrates that same pragmatism now.”The call follows\u0026nbspother warnings from MPs and European leaders that the Article 50 Brexit talks will have to be extended in order to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal.The Institute of Directors (IoD) has published its own report requesting the government releases information to\u0026nbspallow\u0026nbspbusinesses to plan for this scenario.Many companies are still unprepared for Brexit, and it’s hard to blame them. When it comes to knowing what to plan for and when, firms have been left in the dark,” said Stephen Martin, director general of IoD.“Trade associations like the IoD are doing their best to fill the information void, but the reality is that many companies feel they can only make changes once there is tangible information about what they are adjusting to.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/06/14/rtx2l5k1.jpg","title":"interest rate rise latest consumer spending world cup heatwave barclaycard","story":"Created with Sketch.Spending in pubs rose more than 70 per cent the day England played Croatia in the World Cup semi-final\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe hot weather has encouraged shoppers to hit the high streetConsumer spending rose 5 per cent in the UK last month, but one in three are worried about the impact higher interest rates will have on their personal finances, according to the latest research from Barclaycard. Figures show essential spending rose 8.7 per cent compared with July 2017, driven by a 6.7 per cent increase in supermarket spending and 13 per cent jump in petrol. Pub spending got a strong boost due to both the heatwave and the World Cup, rising 16.8 per cent year-on-year in July, and jumping 73 per cent on the day of England’s semi-final against Croatia. The warm weather saw a 4.5 per cent increase in spending on women’s clothing. Troubled retailer Next said the heatwave gave\u0026nbspit an unexpected boost in sales during the three months to 28 July. Almost a quarter of consumers, or 23 per cent,\u0026nbspsaid the hot weather had prompted them to spend more than usual on experiences and outdoor activities. Of these, 56 per cent prioritised spending on day trips, and half bought more food and drink than normal for barbecues and picnics.The numbers showed a marked turnaround from earlier this year, when the Beast from the East kept shoppers off the UK’s high streets, with spending growth dropping to an almost two-year low of 2 per cent in March. However, looking ahead, shoppers remain cautious about the economic landscape and Barclaycard found that confidence in household finances dropped by 6 percentage points between June and July. Rising interest rates was a particular area of concern, with one in three admitting they are worried that the Bank of England’s decision to hike the base rate last week will leave them with less spending money each month. \u0026nbspThe Bank’s monetary policy committee voted unanimously to raise rates to 0.75 per cent, above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis.Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard, said: “The prolonged warm weather combined with England’s World Cup performance has created a short-term boost in spending. The interest rate rise will directly affect victims of austerityUK households spending more than income for first time in 30 yearsWorld Cup and heatwave not enough to lift consumer confidence- survey“With the sunshine showing no sign of abating, spending levels have remained higher than we would normally expect with Brits keen to make the most of the heatwave – whether in the pub over a few drinks or stocking up at the supermarket to enjoy a barbecue.”Ms Harwood added: “It will be interesting to see if this strong level of growth continues as we move into the final stretch of summer. It’s clear that some consumers remain cautious about what’s to come with interest rates rising and overall confidence in household finances down slightly from June.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/25/12/glasto-crop.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6345871  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Glastonbury The Movie (In Flashback)  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/25/12/glasto-crop.jpg","title":"demi lovato","story":"Created with Sketch.Singer has been recovering after she was reportedly found unresponsive at her home in Los Angeles last monthClick to followThe Independent CultureDemi Lovato releases statement after suspected drug overdose: \u0027I will keep fighting\u0027 Demi Lovato\u0026nbsphas issued her first statement after being taken to\u0026nbsphospital for a suspected drug overdose in July.\u0026nbspThis illness is not something that disappears or fades with time, she continued.

Figures show essential spending rose 8.7 per cent compared with July 2017, driven by a 6.7 per cent increase in supermarket spending and 13 per cent jump in petrol. Pub spending got a strong boost due to both the heatwave and the World Cup, rising 16.8 per cent year-on-year in July, and jumping 73 per cent on the day of England’s semi-final against Croatia. The warm weather saw a 4.5 per cent increase in spending on women’s clothing. Troubled retailer Next said the heatwave gave\u0026nbspit an unexpected boost in sales during the three months to 28 July. Almost a quarter of consumers, or 23 per cent,\u0026nbspsaid the hot weather had prompted them to spend more than usual on experiences and outdoor activities. Of these, 56 per cent prioritised spending on day trips, and half bought more food and drink than normal for barbecues and picnics.The numbers showed a marked turnaround from earlier this year, when the Beast from the East kept shoppers off the UK’s high streets, with spending growth dropping to an almost two-year low of 2 per cent in March. However, looking ahead, shoppers remain cautious about the economic landscape and Barclaycard found that confidence in household finances dropped by 6 percentage points between June and July. Rising interest rates was a particular area of concern, with one in three admitting they are worried that the Bank of England’s decision to hike the base rate last week will leave them with less spending money each month. \u0026nbspThe Bank’s monetary policy committee voted unanimously to raise rates to 0.75 per cent, above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis.Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard, said: “The prolonged warm weather combined with England’s World Cup performance has created a short-term boost in spending. The interest rate rise will directly affect victims of austerityUK households spending more than income for first time in 30 yearsWorld Cup and heatwave not enough to lift consumer confidence- survey“With the sunshine showing no sign of abating, spending levels have remained higher than we would normally expect with Brits keen to make the most of the heatwave – whether in the pub over a few drinks or stocking up at the supermarket to enjoy a barbecue.”Ms Harwood added: “It will be interesting to see if this strong level of growth continues as we move into the final stretch of summer. It’s clear that some consumers remain cautious about what’s to come with interest rates rising and overall confidence in household finances down slightly from June.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/19/15/cwacom03.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-4371251  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1.

Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

By peering back into that ancient time, astronomers can try and understand how our Earth came to support life.And by using those same findings, researchers might be able to understand whether there could be life in other solar systems.The research confirms that important organic materials appear to have been formed at the beginnings of our solar system. By looking at the isotopic signature of the compounds within the rocks, they can find the fingerprints of key elements – including\u0026nbspcarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, all of which are both central to the beginnings of life and have been found inside those rocks.If such organic materials can be formed through relatively simple processes in the early solar system, then they might be widespread elsewhere, too. That might mean that life could be found more often in other planetary systems than we had expected, the researchers suggest.The kind of ancient meteorite studied by the University of Manchester scientists are incredibly rare: known as\u0026nbspcarbonaceous chondrites, they comprise only a few per cent of all known meteorites. And they are an incredibly important and unusual way of looking back at the very beginnings of the solar system that surrounds us, since the Earth tends to wipe out such records.“Earth is a dynamic planet – processes such as plate tectonics and erosion have erased most of the early Earth records,” said\u0026nbspRomain Tartèse of Manchester’s School of Earth and Environmental Sciences.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Well, that\u0027s not a million miles from the truth. For the past two summers, 51-year-old Cameron has been spotted at the Wilderness Festival, in Oxfordshire, engaging in some light revelry. This year he would have enjoyed headliners like Justice, Bastille and Nile Rodgers and Chic, or some paddle board yoga and a spa.The former PM\u0027s attendance at the festival did not go unnoticed as a hen party managed to snap a selfie with him and don\u0027t they all look ecstatic?Meanwhile, at Wilderness Festival. pic.twitterSlOD0YEQjCThe snap was shared by one of the members of the party on Instagram complete with the caption:David decided to join the Hens woooppp #mcbrideknotAnother post claimed that they discussed a few hot topics with David. We can also guess that they were which falafel stand was the best? While the hen do seem to have enjoyed bumping into David lets just say that it didn\u0027t go down well elsewhere.So glad David Cameron is all loved up and enjoying the party at the Wilderness Festival. Sorry the rest of us could not make it, we\u0027re busy trying to clean up your monumental Brexit mess. Cheers Dave, you muppet.https:t.coOC7ZMmQ168As we mentioned, this isn\u0027t the first time that Cameron has been seen at Wilderness, which is a fitting title given his current standing in the political landscape.Last year he was seen twice.

Some have already agreed to do so.Each CLP is allowed to propose one motion for discussion at conference, with those receiving the most support from delegates at the gathering likely to be put to a vote. The window for submitting motions opened today.The motion could become party policy if passed, but the Labour leadership is\u0026nbsplikely to strongly resist attempts to force it to change tack.Last year, grassroots attempts to have Brexit debated by delegates at\u0026nbspparty conference\u0026nbspwere seen off by Mr Corbyn’s team and trade union Unite, who\u0026nbspfeared they could force a change in party policy.The latest campaign was endorsed by a number of prominent Labour figures.Manuel\u0026nbspCortes,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the\u0026nbspTSSA\u0026nbsptrade union, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit is a Tory con trick for the benefit of the richest one per cent.

I voted ‘out’ in 1975 and I have fought the advance of neo-liberal orthodoxy for decades. But Brexit\u0026nbspisn’t just about Britain’s membership of the EU.

That’s why I’ll be backing a People’s Vote at this year’s Labour conference.”The move to have the issue\u0026nbspdebated at Labour conference is likely to raise pressure on Mr Corbyn to soften his Brexit stance. A number of senior Labour figures, including shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, have suggested the party could join calls for a\u0026nbspPeople’s Vote. But the Labour leader has insisted: “It’s not our policy to have a second referendum, it’s out policy to respect the result of the referendum.”It\u0026nbspcomes amid\u0026nbspsigns of growing support for a fresh referendum\u0026nbspamong left-wing supporters of Mr Corbyn.

All of this will bind the hands of a future Labour government, and will make it far harder for us to deliver on our promises.”It says Labour must “oppose any Brexit deal that does not satisfy Labour’s six\u0026nbsptests” and instead “call for an immediate general election, and make a manifesto commitment to call a public vote on the Brexit deal with an option to remain in the EU if the public rejects it”.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteMore than 500,000 back The Independent’s Final Say on Brexit campaignAs a Momentum member, this is why I back a Final SayNational Union of Students backs The Independent’s Final Say campaign If the party “cannot get a general election”, the motion says it should “campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to remain in the EU and following a defeat for the government,\u0026nbspcall for an immediate general election”.\u0026nbspThe launch of the campaign\u0026nbspcoincides with\u0026nbspa nationwide “Left Against Brexit” tour to encourage left-wing activists to speak out against Brexit. Organised by the cross-party Another Europe is Possible group, events have been held in a number of major cities and many more are planned for the coming weeks.\u0026nbspMarina\u0026nbspPrentoulis, a spokesperson for Another Europe is Possible, said: “Time is up on the Brexit process, and the only version of Brexit we are going to get is a Tory one.

Fury as travellers ruin Lord of the Rings beauty spot leaving rubbish                RUBBISH! Travellers FURIOUS over litter on illegal camp siteIt went ahead despite allegations that Brotherhood Wood already has too many residents, and amid investigations into claims that many are not travellers or gypsies, but migrant workers from Eastern Europe who are not permitted to live there.In an open letter to Swale\u0027s cabinet member for planning, Councillor Gerry Lewin, the parish council\u0027s chairman Jeff Tutt is now asking Swale to reconsider, saying it has the power to revoke permission under the Town and Country Planning Act.Calling the decision to allow the site to grow seriously perverse, the letter stated the borough council completely ignored the many and varied material considerations that were put forward for refusal.Concerns were also raised that, under the new layout, some families could have a space smaller than the minimum size of a one-bedroom flat to live in, and that Kent Police usually recommend that traveller sites have no more than 15 pitches.It is also feared that a larger number of pitches at the site could be used as grounds to refuse permission for gypsies and travellers to reside in other places.The number of pitches at the Brotherhood Wood site set to increase from 29 to 40 (Image: SWNS)A spokesman for Swale Borough Council said that although potential planning breaches are still being investigated, the authority is not considering revoking permission.It has argued that refusing an application without sound planning reasons could leave it open to an expensive appeal process.Replying to the letter, director of regeneration Emma Wiggins said: I cannot agree with your position that it was unreasonable for the experienced and well advised Planning Committee to determine the application in the way that it was advised to do.Considering the application on its merits, it was resolved to permit the application. This decision was made by the committee, who were fully alive to the local opposition.There would seem to be no merit in seeking to revoke the permission granted by the committee in such circumstances in the absence of any new material considerations having come to light.

Getty1 of 29Countries that are in the European Union Speaking to MEPs in June, Mr Selmayr stressed the importance of no shipping links between Ireland the Northern Europe because Dublin would no longer be able to rely on British ports as a route to the Continent.A document, briefed by Mr Selmayr to MEPs, said: \u0026ldquoThe proposal will design a new maritime route to link Ireland with the continental part of the North Sea-Mediterranean corridor.The new North Sea-Mediterranean route aims to redirect billions of euros worth of trade from the usual overlands route through Britain to Belgium and Netherlands.This has put the French government under domestic pressure after seven French ports \u0026ndash Roscoff, Brest, Cherborug, Le Havre, Caen, Calais and Dunkirk \u0026ndash were considered but ultimately ruled out the plans.Both Roscoff and Cherbourg are actually closer to Ireland than the Dutch and Belgian alternatives picked by the Commission.In the EU\u0026rsquos draft budget for 2021-2027, there is a proposed \u0026euro30.6 billion available for its Connecting Europe Facility \u0026ndash which is designed to assist with major infrastructure upgrades across the bloc.This means France could lose out on billions of EU funding as the Dutch and Belgian ports can apply for funds to increase their capacity ahead of the new routes being opened.The new Irish shipping routes are, however, a fallback measure in the event of a no deal Brexit, which the Commission said it is working day and night to avoid.

Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared. How about this for an idea: let’s all try to be kind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A disgrace. Its been a waste of time. You try and do the right thing, you put your faith in the police and the CPS and they let you down.Kevin McCarthy, 60, whose son-in-laws car was also targeted, confronted the officers in the case, PCs Steve Smallman and Gemma Jackson.He said: Its been a balls up from you guys from the start to the finish. We had to push and push and push to get it this far.Hes got off because you guys and them in the court (prosecutors) havent done your jobs properly.My grandchildren were in the car after it had been attacked. Their lives were at risk because of what happened.Electrician Chris Moores, 33, who installed the cameras outside his home in Carlton Miniott, North Yorks, said: Ive no faith whatsoever in the police.How can anyone have any faith in seeing justice done when things like this happen?I know people whose cars got damaged and mine got done twice. The police didnt seem like they were getting any closer to catching who was doing it.So I installed a camera and we got him.The next day he walked past again in the same coat, same dog, everything the same.We handed it over to the police, they had nothing to do but get him charged and put before a court. They couldnt even do that properly.The CCTV footage, obtained by The Sun, shows the suspect strolling along the pavement with his frail wife and pet dog on February 25.He spots a car parked up on the kerb, looks both ways and then discreetly bends down before jabbing at the tyre and walking on.A day later the residents obtained more CCTV footage of the attacker walking his dog in broad daylight and positively identified it as Richards.Victim Jonathan Sharpehouse told the court: I looked at the footage and knew it was Bryn.He walks passed my house every day and Ive known him for 20-25 years. He was with his wife and his dog.Prosecutor Gareth Henderson-Moore told JPs: It was crucial evidence without which the crown could not proceed with the case.”But Mrs Simon - addressing the late disclosure of the CCTV - said: Courts are getting concerned that the CPS are failing to comply with directions.This is becoming very regular. I am not happy and Im quite sure my colleagues are not happy that the CPS are not complying with directions.We have to decide if Mr Richards is going to get a fair trial. This is a question the CPS should be asking itself long before a trial comes to court.You should be trial ready when you come to court.Richards, from Sandhutton, North Yorks, denied criminal damage at Harrogate Magistrates Court and insisted it was a case of mistaken identity.A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: Were sorry we let the villagers down in this case.“We acknowledge the magistrates comments, and we recognise that we should have done better.“We will review the quality of the investigation to establish what happened and ensure lessons are learned.Richards was originally charged with eight separate slashing attacks but the CPS dropped seven charges at the start of his farcical trial.A CPS spokesperson said: We note the comments of the magistrate and will review our handling of the case.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest of our stuff is still in storage but we’ve only got that until August 8.After that, we’ve got no money to put our stuff anywhere so it’s most likely going to be destroyed. We are absolutely stuck.”The mum is now expected to meet with Target Housing, a charity that helps find temporary housing for people at risk of homelessness.Ms Tomassi had lived in her home for three years but was aware that neighbours often complained about her son’s behaviour and angry outbursts.The mum also suffered a health emergency two years ago after suffering a heart attack and being subsequently diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia – a condition which causes the arteries to narrow.Shortly after, she developed anxiety and depression, and claims her benefits were stopped during the same period.Following the eviction order, Tomassi was allegedly offered emergency housing, but she declined and chose to move in with a friend nearby.She then rented two garages for £18 a week to store her possessions and furniture.However, she has now fallen on hard times and claims she can no longer afford the fees for the storage space which she is due to empty on August 8.The mum previously opened up to Hull Daily Mail, saying she had never been in in this kind of situation before.She said: On Tuesday night we all went to sit in the garage at 10.30pm and my little one started crying.“He said ‘I’m not staying here anymore’ and he was crying his heart out.“He ran back to the flat and wouldn’t stop crying. It was heartbreaking.“It’s awful to see my children like that and it’s stressing me out because I can’t do anything.“We are all crammed into a living room with two on a double mattress, one on the settee and one on the chair with a pouffe.”Tomassi has appealed her eviction, adding: “I just feel like the council haven’t given us a chance. I’ve tried to get the benefits back and I am doing my best but I’m not a miracle worker.“My Jobseeker’s Allowance stopped because I had no address and I need to reapply. Meals are hard to come by and the money I am on isn’t enough.While Hull City Council claims to be working with the family to resolve the issue, the authority said appropriate action must be taken when substantial amounts of rent are owed.A spokeswoman told Hull Daily Mail: “If a tenant is having difficulties complying with their tenancy agreement we always try to work with tenants to solve any problems, with eviction being the last resort.“In Ms Tomassi’s case, we were left with no option but eviction due to escalating rent arrears and the detrimental effect of her behaviour in the neighbourhood.“She and her children were offered emergency accommodation, which she refused. We are continuing to work with partners with regard to Ms Tomassi and her family’s circumstances.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425132515.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"12 labour mps in secret plot to oust jeremy corbyn hold secret summit at farmhouse and plot how to take back control","story":"Sources told the  that a gang of around 12 MPs have been holding secret away days to discuss how to take back control of the party.A group of them are reported to have caught the same 7.18am train from Waterloo East on a Thursday night to Stonegate, before getting a taxi to the luxury estate, Fair Oak Farm, in Sussex.The fightback has been taking place at the £144-a-night grade II listed farmhouse, built in the 1600s.The paper claims the attendees were a string of moderate MPs, including former leadership candidate Liz Kendall, and former shadow cabinet members Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie.Meetings are said to have taken place in other locations too - and a potential rebel list of more than 20.The reports come as Jeremy Corbyn is still desperately fighting to get a grip on the anti-Semitism crisis engulfing his own party.A source at the meetings told the : “We are getting together regularly to discuss how to take back control of the party.“At some point the Corbyn leadership is going to fail and collapse, we only need to see what is happening with the anti-Semitism problem, and we need to be ready to step in, win the leadership, rebuild the party as a credible force and repair the damage that has been done.”Another attendee at the away days told the Express: “As things stand Labour could win the next election simply because the Tories have made such a mess over Brexit and look so incompetent.“If that happens we will break away and either form a separate Labour Party within parliament or a new party.“There are [Remainer] Conservative and Lib Dem MPs who are interested in joining us if we do form a new party because of Brexit.”The MP added: “The issue would be then whether we would have time to create a proper identity before an election or if there would need to be an election soon after. In that sense it is complicated.”But Corbyn-critic Stephen Kinnock, who was also said to have attended the away day, said he could not recall the meeting.He said: “Hand on heart I have no clue about that.

Yes it is its largest military player. Yes we are a cultural powerhouse. Yes we are their biggest individual market. Britain is powerful - but the EU is more powerful than we are.On paper - this should not be surprising, yet no politician, of any stripe, would ever dare say it.But the facts speak for themselves: We are 65 million of a bloc of 450 million. Ours is a $2.9trn (\u0026#1632.2trn) economy, they are $19trn (\u0026#16314.6trn) They represent 44% of our exports. We, just 9% of theirs. They are 27 - we are one.The impact of a no deal (as all the studies show) would be considerable but they have a crucial advantage: they are able to spread the risk and burden. For that reason, the same studies show, it would hurt us far more. We have nowhere else to turn.This should not be surprising. Imagine another country taking Britain\u0027s place - that we had \u0027Frexit\u0027 or \u0027Nexit\u0027 or \u0027Spexit\u0027 or even \u0027Deutschexit\u0027, ask yourself where the power would lie. It would be with the remaining states of the union.That we struggle to come to terms with that is, I think, deeply revealing of the British psyche.This imbalance was obscured through years of membership - we had no need to confront our own relative weakness as a member of the club - but now we are outside, that asymmetry of power is exposed for all to see.That is why we have accepted concession after concession, not because of Theresa May\u0027s pusillanimity but because of the hard truths of realpolitik.That is why Mrs May and her ministers have been conducting a grand tour of Europe. Not because they want yet more sea bass and asparagus in yet another state dinner, but because they recognise how powerful they are as a bloc and how isolated we are in their face.They want to tear them asunder, to divide and conquer - this is what David Davis said would happen during the referendum. Yet, they have remained, in 18 months a united set of two, while our own house, our own government, has been fatally divided.Time and again throughout our history, Britain has acted to prevent the emergence of a hegemonic power which controlled all of Europe, aware that Britain, even with an empire, could not resist a united continent\u0027s gravitational pull. Today\u0027s crop of politicians, seem to have forgotten that lesson. Looked at through the psychology of the British public\u0027s collective psyche, we can see Mrs May as the Wizard of Oz - less powerful than her people think, or than our population would like others to believe.That is what is invidious about Brexit for British politicians - for the British public to accept Chequers, or something like it, would essentially be to ask the British people to accept a downgrade of their own view of British power, a downgrade of the sort of country we think we should be and that we think we are.We are not an especially jingoistic nation, but that is much to stomach. It is a view which, however unfair, would be repeated and churned by the exact Brexiteers who, from Mrs May\u0027s point of view, forced us to accept the downgrade in the first place."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-ola-bhavish-aggarwal_4382913.jpg?20180807135438 ","title":"liam fox faces ridicule over u turn on brexit no deal","story":"So what has changed? A lot, actually. The Chequers deal has bombed with Tory MPs and activists, including members of the PM\u0027s own association in Maidenhead.Two senior cabinet ministers, David Davis and Boris Johnson, have resigned, with Mr Davis\u0027s former lieutenants Steve Baker and Stewart Jackson now acting as pro-Brexit attack dogs.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is now firmly re-installed as the darling of the Tory grassroots and the hot favourite with the activists to replace Mrs May as party leader and prime minister.Then there has been the reaction to the Chequers deal from Michel Barnier, accused by Dr Fox in his Sunday Times interview of \"intransigence\" and of making no deal more likely. In his lofty, patrician manner and with customary \"hauteur\", Mr Barnier picked the Chequers plan apart clause by clause, to the extent that even its biggest fans fear it is now mort dans l\u0027eau.And that\u0027s one reason why Theresa May was probably wasting her time when she went to the French president\u0027s Riviera retreat and told him Brussels faces a choice between the Chequers deal and no deal.When I went to Strasbourg for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s address to the European Parliament in April, I was told by senior MEPs that the president and Mr Barnier are extremely close politically.As a result, President Macron - probably the EU\u0027s chief powerbroker now that Angela Merkel\u0027s authority is waning - will ensure that his \"uncle\" succeeds Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission next year.No wonder President Macron told Mrs May at Napoleon\u0027s stronghold of Fort Bregancon that he was not willing to break the Brexit deadlock by breaking ranks with the EU\u0027s negotiators.\"There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Monsieur Barnier,\" a French diplomat was reported to have said, confirming the president\u0027s close alignment with Mr Barnier.And so in spite of Mrs May\u0027s Riviera charm offensive, there has at the same time been a significant change in tone in the government\u0027s Brexit language in recent weeks, as the Chequers plan has faced derision and rejection. First there has been what Brexiteers claim has been a return of \"project fear\" scare stories, about stockpiling of food and medicines, lorry gridlock at Dover, long queues at border control and customs and fees for travel visas.But the biggest change in tone has come in the Foreign Office, where Boris Johnson\u0027s clown-like bluster and looseness with facts and detail have been replaced by the more thoughtful approach of Jeremy Hunt.Instead of Mr Johnson\u0027s gung-ho and cavalier approach to Brexit, former Remainer Mr Hunt has been deadly serious in his warnings of the risk of \"no deal by accident\" increasing by the day.Then last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - denounced as \"the high priest of Project Fear\" by Jacob Rees-Mogg - said the risk of no deal was \"uncomfortably high and highly undesirable\".Are all these dire warnings aimed at putting pressure on Brussels to sign up to a deal? Almost certainly. Will they work? Probably not.

The council voted in favour of the resolution, which says the star should be removed because of Trump’s “disturbing treatment of women and other actions that do not meet the shared values of the City of West Hollywood, the region, state and country.” The star has been repeatedly vandalised - most recently by Austin Clay, who used a pick axe to destroy it. He was reportedly bailed out of jail by James Otis, who himself took a sledgehammer to the stone in February 2017. But despite the resolution, it seems unlikely the star will be removed. The motion urges Los Angeles City Council and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the slab.  The Walk of Fame is managed by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, who have previously refused to remove stars from the walk. In December 2015 they refused widespread calls to remove Bill Cosby’s star over the multiple sexual assault allegations against him. CEO Leron Gubler said at the time: The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a registered historic landmark. Once a star has been added to the Walk, it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Because of this, we have never removed a star from the Walk. But West Hollywood City Council said the star remains “the property of the City of Los Angeles” and that the city has “ultimate responsibility for the condition and maintenance of the Walk of Fame.” "},{"url":null,"title":"today day wed run out","story":"NewsToday is the day we\u0027d \u0027run out of food\u0027 in Mad Max-style Brexit apocalypseIf we\u0027re unable to easily import food from the EU and elsewhere, we\u0027d have run out by this time next yearShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter14:40, 7 AUG 2018NewsThe British Farmers Union say this is the day next year we\u0027d run out of food (Image: Daily Record)Get politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Britain would run out of food by this day next year if it can\u0027t easily import food from from the EU and elsewhere after Brexit , Farmers have warned.  The National Farmers Union claim a no-deal Brexit would leave the country facing shortages by August 7th, 2019. A long-term decline in self-sufficiency that has stagnated at around 60% in recent years means around three quarters of the shortfall is imported from the rest of the European Union. Farmers have also been wrangling with the impact of the summer heatwave, which has pushed concerns around food production into sharp focus, the National Farmers\u0027 Union (NFU) warned.  President Minette Batters said: This has been a real test for Government to show the farmers and the many concerned members of the public that they think that our ability to produce food in this country is truly important. We strongly believe that every British citizen should be entitled to a safe, traceable and high-quality supply of British food that is produced to some of the highest animal welfare and environmental standards in the world. Home-grown food production must have the unwavering support of Government if we are to achieve this post-Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May insisted last month that the public should take reassurance and comfort from Government preparations for a no-deal Brexit after ministers suggested food and medicines would be stockpiled in case of shortages.

A study of 2,000 cat owners revealed many are oblivious about what foods could be harmful to their moggy’s health – with some even sharing takeaways and leftovers. A fifth of owners don’t even know their cats are carnivores – with one in 10 feeding them raw vegetables and another one in 20 serving up salad leaves. The research, commissioned by Lily’s Kitchen, to coincide with the launch of its new Suppurrs Stew cat food range, also found nearly four in 10 cat owners NEVER check the label when buying cat food, with 64 per cent baffled about what they should look for. One in 20 simply buy the cheapest cat food on offer, and a further 15 per cent swap from brand to brand depending on what’s the best value. But leading veterinarian Rodney Zasman has warned that serving up some of the cheaper cat foods available could be no better than feeding your cat a daily dose of McDonald’s.  He said: “It’s alarming that many of the nation’s cat owners are oblivious to what constitutes a healthy diet for their pets, particularly when healthy eating plays such a big part in modern day living for the owners themselves. “One of the biggest dangers to our cats’ health is actually poor quality, mass produced pet food. “In some instances these foods contain as little as four per cent meat and, as a result, cats aren’t getting the nutrition they need to keep them healthy. But many cat owners are largely unaware of this fact and only find out when they take their poorly or overweight moggy to the vet.” Four in 10 Brits give food items to their cat despite not being sure it’s healthy for them while almost a quarter still give their pet treats knowing it won’t do them any good. A further 40 per cent are happy to share their own meals with their cats, with a third of pet owners giving them cheese without realising large amounts can be dangerous One in 20 have offered it a piece of chocolate and almost a fifth are happy to let their cat lick from a bowl of cream, which can be unhealthy for moggies. One pet owner even claimed their cat loves nothing more than to nibble on a piece of leftover fruitcake, which could be harmful to the animal. Sadly, a fifth of cat owners have had to take their pet to the vet after it ate something which disagreed with it. A further 28 per cent admit their cat has been diagnosed with either being overweight or other medical conditions such as skin problems and diabetes due to its diet. It also emerged that despite not being clued up on feline food needs, two thirds of British cat owners believe the food they buy covers all of their pet’s nutritional requirements.  And while 67 per cent of owners would NOT be prepared to feed their cat carcasses of other animals, hides and skins, pigs’ bristles, heads of poultry and feathers, experts have warned this can be found in some cat foods in supermarkets today. Vet Rodney Zasman added:“Feline obesity is a huge issue in the UK, as well as a host of other health complaints, many of which are caused by eating the wrong type of food which is low in real meat and high in a range of other, less nutritious ingredients, cleverly disguised on the label as ‘meat and animal derivatives’. “In many cases it isn’t the owner’s fault however. Cats are independent creatures and often very fussy eaters so it’s not always easy to tell when a cat is becoming unwell due to its diet. As owners we just want to see our pets happy and feeding them something they like is usually top of owners’ priorities.” This is reflected in the survey results, with a third of respondents saying the choice of food to provide isn’t theirs – as their cat simply won’t eat a brand other than its favourite. However, by patiently transitioning cats onto new foods, owners can have a much better success rate when introducing a new recipe.

Construction site manager David Jones, 37, suspected Stacey Buckley may have found new love after they broke up so he put the device in the boot of her vehicle to track her movements, a court heard. The tracking set had been bought on eBay and would be triggered once the ignition of Ms Buckley\u0027s car had started. When Ms Buckley said she was going on a shopping trip Jones - now a convicted stalker - noticed she had made a detour to a house and decided to follow. He later found her holding hands with her sister\u0027s ex-girlfriend Laura Flynn and laughing together in a cafe at the Trafford Centre shopping mall, Manchester Magistrates\u0027 Court was told.  Ms Buckley found out about the device when Jones sent a bragging picture of the tracker after he kept inexplicably showing up in the same place as her and exclaiming: I\u0027ll find you wherever you are. He also said he was spying on her using the IMO phone app and Ms Buckley searched her car and found the small black Rewire Security tracker hidden inside the vehicle. During a later confrontation about where she’d been that day, Ms Buckley said Jones turned up at her home and \u0027grabbed her throat and pinned her against the door\u0027. Jones, from Rochdale, was found guilty of stalking and a separate charge of assault on Ms Buckley following the confrontation at her home. The court heard the couple\u0027s romance crumbled last year and Ms Buckley later started dating her sister\u0027s former partner Miss Flynn.  Ms Buckley told the hearing: We hadn\u0027t been happy and David moved out. We had a holiday booked in October and decided to go but we were not back together. He would constantly text asking questions and asking where I was and he started appearing in places I was. I was in a new relationship in mid November with Laura Flynn and I was in a Starbucks and he would turn up. He made a point of saying \u0027I\u0027ll find you wherever you are\u0027 and he would slander me on social media. I know all about trackers and I questioned him and asked how he knew. He made me believe that he put a tracker on my phone using the IMO number. I was really scared, and I thought every second of my life was being followed and watched by him even though we weren\u0027t together. He sent a picture of the tracker showing my route and location with a start and end time and I knew it related to my ignition from the car so I searched the vehicle and found the tracker. He said the tracker did its job and he found out. He wanted to do it because he wanted to know where I was and he thought it was his business to know what I was doing.  The court heard the image showed Ms Buckley\u0027s location, route, times and address. Texts showed Jones admitted tracking her and he said he would go to the police and admit it - suggesting he was jealous of the new relationship adding: You must be fine but my head is gone. The following December Ms Buckley was attacked by Jones during a confrontation at her home. She added: He pushed me back into the door, and then closed it behind him and began shouting at me saying he knew where I had been that day. He saw red. I have never seen him be like that, and had never been domestically violent before. He grabbed my throat and pinned me against the door. It was like he was looking right through me. I was pinned against the door at the bottom of the stairs. I asked him to leave but he refused. He removed the lock from the front door with a screw driver so I had no lock on the door for that night. Later whilst investigation by police he sent me a text saying he \u0027didn\u0027t give a f..k\u0027 that he wasn\u0027t supposed to contact me and sent me abusive text messages. It has had a massive impact on me. He wanted to know where I was all the time. His behaviour was not reasonable at all. I suffer with anxiety because of this.”  She said they did have a lot of issues in the relationship. Ms Buckley said they went on holiday in September and took photos throughout, but added that people paint a picture on Facebook of what they want you to see about a relationship. We spoke about the problems we had time and time again he says he wasn\u0027t aware of the problems and he started to think there were things going on behind his back,” she told. Ms Buckley said she was not seeing anyone while she was with Jones, saying it was not his business what happened in October and she was not having an affair. She said: I know Laura because she was in a relationship with my sister before me but both of us were not in a relationship when we got together. I\u0027m not sure if me and Laura were holding hands on the day he saw us. On one occasion I posted a snapchat photo of my leg in bed, and he assumed it was Laura\u0027s so he text me saying I had been seen with \u0027my slut in bed\u0027. Prosecutor Ann Deakin told the court: The couple were in a relationship but up to seven months before the incidents, the relationship deteriorated. They tried to rekindle but it was unsuccessful and he believed she was having an affair. Due to this he placed a tracker on her car. He struggled to cope with the relationship being over. During October the defendant would contact the victim on regular occasions, and would turn up to places where she was and he saw the complainant with a third party, confirming the affair to him. On November 17 she searched her vehicle and found a small black tracking device in the boot. The defendant has made reference to him tracking her in text messages. This caused her considerable stress as he continued to follow and watch her.

Teenager Lucy sparked a desperate search involving family, friends and police after she went missing from her home two weeks ago. Tragically, her body was discovered in woodland almost 24 hours later, with police revealing she had been stabbed to death. Today, Hampshire police released CCTV footage from a Tesco store just half a mile from Southampton Sports Centre, Hants, where her body was found. A CCTV camera pointed at the entrance of the store shows Lucy walking across the car park at 9.30am, just half an hour after she left home, in a white top and camouflage leggings.  She is also carrying a \u0027distinctive black jacket\u0027, which had white sleeves and the words RADKE 01 on the back. The police force revealed the footage is the \u0027first confirmed sighting\u0027 of the murdered teenager - almost two weeks after the investigation first started. Detective Superintendent Paul Barton said: Since leaving her house in Mansel Road East at 9am on Wednesday 25 July, we now know that Lucy was close to the Sports Centre just half an hour later. We need to know how she reached the Tesco Express and where she went next. Maybe you were driving or cycling past at that time and can remember something. You may even have DashCam or action camera footage. We\u0027re really hoping the CCTV footage will jog people\u0027s memories so we can further build up a picture of Lucy\u0027s movements. You will see that Lucy was carrying her jacket at the time. It was a hot day, so you may have seen her wearing a white vest top. We\u0027re also asking runners or walkers to check their mapping apps for the period in question. They may realise they were close to the scene of the murder and have information that might be useful to our investigation.

Katie Ireson, 25, experienced horrific stomach pains while sitting in the busy waiting room bleeding and crying as she lost her pregnancy. Now Mrs Ireson, who lives in Mayhill in Swansea, is calling for change in the way miscarriage is explained to women in the early stages of pregnancy. The mum added that her experience lacked compassion by health professionals during the loss. She also wants more women to be aware of what they can do if they suspect they are having a miscarriage. Katie, who has two children aged six and four, discovered she was pregnant in February. At the five or six week mark, she visited the midwife.  I told her I knew something was wrong. I was having bad stomach pains and no pregnancy symptoms, she told Wales Online .  When I had my two boys I was throwing up from day one, nauseated all the time, had sore breasts and other symptoms.

It’s not something I’ve been through before. I called 111 and they said as my stomach pains were so horrific I should go to Morriston Hospital A\u0026ampE, so I went with my husband and our two boys as we didn\u0027t have anyone to look after them. I waited seven-and-a-half hours before I stormed through the doors and demanded to be seen.

Natalie Coates, 32, was found by her partner Jason laying in the road after being hit by a car in December 2014. The mum-of-two, who is a full-time carer for 13-year-old daughter Briany, said their lives have now changed forever after both ending up relying on wheelchairs. Natalie was left with bulging discs in her spine that leave her in such agony, she is unable to clothe, wash or even cook for herself.  Jason was forced to quit his sales manager job last year to care for both Briany, who has a number of life-limiting conditions including quadriplegic cerebral palsy , and his partner - yet they say NHS doctors were unable to help Natalie and she was forced to go private.   They are now unable to go out as a family after claiming the NHS have failed to provide Natalie with a power-assisted chair and it is impossible for Jason to push two wheelchairs.   Now the couple are in a race against time to raise enough cash to have the three bulging discs replaced at a cost of \u0026pound22,000 each, as specialists warn she could be left permanently paralysed if they don\u0027t have the operation soon. Natalie, from Bradford, West Yorks, said: It has been soul destroying to go from being Briany\u0027s primary care giver, looking after her because she is in a wheelchair to now being in a wheelchair myself and unable to care for her. My life changed overnight. Seeing Jason now do everything I used to do but now can\u0027t do, it\u0027s not nice at all. I want to be there for my children and there for Jason as a partner but I can\u0027t give them the attention they need or what they require. It makes me feel less of a mother to be honest. Briany needs 24-hour care and it\u0027s heartbreaking that I can no longer give it to her. If I were to get this operation and it were to fix me, it would give me my life back. But what constantly plays on the couple\u0027s minds is that if they don\u0027t have the operation soon, there is a risk that Natalie could be left permanently paralysed. Jason said: A private specialist warned us that if it is left untreated, the discs can become sharp over time and it only takes one wrong movement for them to sever the spinal cord. This would leave Natalie permanently paralysed - there is no coming back from that. Natalie was walking home from the gym and was due to go and pick up Briany when she was hit by the taxi as she crossed a road only five minutes from her home.  As she lay in the street being helped by passersby, Jason was driving home with their other daughter Alicia, six, when he spotted Natalie\u0027s white handbag on the floor - and his heart sank. Jason said: There was an instant overwhelming sense of fear. But I just knew, my heart sank. It was the worst moment - especially then when I saw her black coat on the floor. I pulled over and there she was laying on the floor. A few cars had stopped and pedestrians. A taxi driver had gone through the red lights, despite her green man showing. He went right through and ran her over. Workmen had stopped the taxi driver. Without them I suspect he\u0027d have just driven off. He hadn\u0027t even got out of the car. He didn\u0027t even bother seeing if she was OK. Natalie said: I was appalled to be honest. Not once did he even get out to see if I was OK until Jason and police got there. I find that so bad. After being rushed to hospital, Natalie had a number of CT scans due to a cut to the head and remained there a week and a half. Following the accident she was unable to use her right arm, however she claims doctors were unable to diagnose the cause and put it down to muscle pain. Natalie said: I couldn\u0027t move my right arm so I had to do everything using left arm - driving, cooking, cleaning and pushing my daughter\u0027s wheelchair. Don\u0027t ask me how I did it, I don\u0027t know, I just managed. I learned to adapt. However the situation got increasingly worse and Natalie awoke one morning in September last year unable to move at all.  Jason heard her screaming and rushed upstairs to find her on the floor in agony. She then spent four months bed bound and while she is now able to be transferred to the sofa or a wheelchair, is usually in too much pain to go outside. Jason said: Every day since then we have spent researching it, speaking to GPs, doctors and so on and we have had no answers. Doctors just put it down to the accident and because they couldn\u0027t find a root problem they just said this was something we\u0027re going to have to learn to live with. But we can\u0027t accept that. It is too severe - there has to be something underlying that is wrong. Someone doesn\u0027t just go from that person to that person like that. Eventually Natalie went private and an MRI revealed she was suffering from three or four impinging and abutting discs against her spinal cord. The couple have found a specialist in Barcelona who believes she would be eligible for surgery to replace the discs - at the whopping cost of \u0026pound22,000 each. But the family desperately need to raise the cash for flights, accommodation and the cost of the expensive private tests and scans to check Natalie is eligible for the potentially life-changing surgery. Jason said: It\u0027s hard to overexaggerate just how much of an affect this has had on our lives. For me, I have gone from having an outgoing, active, really sociable partner who went to the gym most days and doted on her daughter. She loved shopping and seeing friends.  Seeing someone who was like that become completely dependent on me, is really hard to watch. She has lost her self esteem. She spends most days crying. If she didn\u0027t have me as her partner, she wouldn\u0027t be able to care for her own children. Seeing that transformation - she is like a shell of her former self. I have to do everything for Natalie now. I do all of her personal care, cook all her food, cut it all up before she eats it, get her dressed, do her hair, take her out. I had to quit my job as we simply couldn\u0027t manage as Natalie couldn\u0027t do anything for herself either anymore. It was a hard decision as I don\u0027t even like to take days off but my family needed me and that\u0027s what I had to do. If I\u0027m not here, then she is either in bed or on the sofa and unable to move from there. I am her 24/7 carer. The couple are angry that the \u0027reckless\u0027 actions of the taxi driver have cost them so much. However because there had been no witnesses to the accident and no skid marks to indicate if he had been speeding, the driver was never prosecuted by police. Jason said: Although we don\u0027t know the driver, he owes her a new life. One silly mistake has cost her everything as she can\u0027t do anything she used to do anymore. He has taken a mum away from her two girls and stopped her being able to be a mother. He has taken a really active person and made her bed bound. Despite the driver not being prosecuted by police, Natalie was awarded compensation after the accident - however it was only when she was having problems with her arm and before she was left wheelchair-bound.  Jason says that the couple regret accepting the paltry amount, which was under \u0026pound2,000, as it in no way makes up for how badly the crash has affected her life. Jason said: In hindsight I wish we had waited - her condition has deteriorated now and I\u0027m sure with the more detailed medical reports we now have she would have got more in compensation that could now have helped towards her surgery. The mum-of-two is open about how much the operation means to her and how much it could change her life for the better. Natalie said: People take their lives for granted. I didn\u0027t realise I took my life for granted. I thought I appreciated everything. Obviously having a child with complex needs you do look at your life differently anyway. But there probably were some things I took for granted. I\u0027d moan about my weight, finances, house work - silly things. This has made me appreciate how good my life was even though it was complicated and stressful. But there are lots of people out there who would like to have that life and are in worse positions. And now I\u0027m in this position, there is nothing more than I want than to get my life back and life it to the fullest. Maybe one day I will be able to do my own hair again or make-up. That would be amazing.

Asmaa Hemdan said she was called \u0027ignorant\u0027, a \u0027dog\u0027 and \u0027disgusting\u0027 while working for gynaecology specialist Dr Safaa Ismail and husband consultant neurosurgeon Hussien Al-Maghraby. The 37- year-old said she was fed leftovers and when she complained, was locked in a bedroom for two days with no food and had to drink from a tap in the bathroom. She also claimed they took her passport off her, made veiled threats to sell her and paid her just \u0026pound400 in five months. The tribunal was told Miss Hemdan was banned from her room and forced to sleep on the sofa if she displeased the couple.  She also said that Dr Safaa told her brother in Egypt they could always pay someone to kill her. Miss Hemdan was flown to Britain to work for the married couple, who are also from Egypt, in 2011 as a nanny to their four-year-old son. She was promised \u0026pound200 per month and board at their three-storey family home in Muswell Hill, north London. But Watford Employment Tribunal was told payments stopped after two months and Miss Hemdan, who has 12 siblings in Egypt and worked to support her family, was forced to hand over her bank card. She claims she eventually fled five months into the job when she was left alone at the couple\u0027s house.  Miss Hemdan began the work, which the tribunal heard was supposed to be eight hours per day, six days per week, on May 26, 2011. At one point in August when she complained about the alleged conditions, Dr Safaa became furious, it is claimed. In her witness statement, Miss Hemdan said: Dr Safaa became furious and began to shout at Miss Hemdan, as she did so pushing her up the stairs. Miss Hemdan was then locked in one of the bedrooms. Miss Hemdan was told that she could come out when she apologised.  She was instructed to remain in her room and did so for two days before being allowed out of the room. Miss Hemdan told the tribunal: I was in my room for two days and no one brought me any food or water. I was too frightened to leave the room as I was scared of Dr Safaa. I was able to drink water from the sink in the bathroom. She added: I was treated as a servant and often told that I was a servant. The nanny alleged to the tribunal Dr Safaa was responsible for much of the treatment.  She once told Miss Hemdan that she had girls working for her before and that if they didn\u0027t like things then she sold them on, it is alleged. Miss Hemdan said: I was shocked when she said this. I remember I said: \u0027Sold them?\u0027, because I was so shocked, and Dr Safaa said: \u0027Yes, if you sell the passport the girl follows it like a dog\u0027. On another occasion, when Miss Hemdan visited the bank with the doctor, she was asked if she would be willing to sell her kidney, it is alleged. Miss Hemdan said: Dr Safaa told me that she was talking to the bank manager about her illness as she had a kidney problem.  As we were leaving, Dr Safaa said to me that some people sell a kidney to another person who needs one. I did not know what to say. Dr Safaa waited a moment and then asked me what did I think about that? I answered that if someone would do it, it would be a human and good thing to do. Dr Safaa replied: \u0027Are you willing?\u0027. I said no, that I was talking in general, not about my own kidney. Dr Safaa said that she could get me \u0026pound25,000 if I agreed to give us my kidney. I believe that when she said us she meant her and the bank manager. I said no, I could not possibly do this. I said that we do not own our kidneys, they are given to us by Allah.  Miss Hemdan told the tribunal she was given an en-suite guest room in the family\u0027s loft during the stay. She said: If Dr Safaa was upset with me she would not let me sleep in my bedroom. On those occasions I was told that I would have to sleep on a sofa in the living room. She added: Dr Safaa told me that I was always to use the bathroom in my bedroom. She told me that she did not know where I had come from and what germs and microbes I might have. It is alleged Dr Safaa would call Miss Hemdan dog and asked to be referred to as hadretek, an Arabic term said to denote superiority. The nanny said: This meant that I always had to speak to Dr Safaa as though she was higher or more important than me. If I did not do so, she shouted at me.

The railway is not a playground and we would urge parents to speak to their children about how to keep safe at level crossings, stations and when using the railway. Crossings are safe if they\u0027re used correctly but the problem we do have is people disregarding the safety of the railways.

A total of 395 cases of the Cyclospora infection by people who had eaten in the fast food restaurant across 15 different US states were recorded as of Thursday, according to the Food and Drug Administration.  It is usually caught from eating raw fruit and vegetables contaminated with human poo, the NHS says.   Sixteen of the 395 people who became ill in the US were hospitalised.  The FDA is currently reviewing the distribution and supplier information for romaine lettuce and carrots.  Most people infected with Cyclospora  develop diarrhea, with frequent and sometimes explosive, bowel movements.  Other common symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps or pain, bloating, increased gas, nausea, and fatigue, the FDA says.  People infected by Cyclospora cayetanensis, a microscopic parasite of humans, may also suffer from vomiting, body aches, headache, fever, and other flu-like symptoms.  The FDA wrote in a statement : As of August 2, 2018, a total of 395 laboratory-confirmed cases of Cyclospora infection were reported in people who consumed salads from McDonald’s restaurants the cases were reported by 15 states.  Note, the Connecticut, Tennessee, and Virginia case-patients purchased salads while traveling in Illinois the Florida case-patient purchased a salad while traveling in Kentucky. The investigation is ongoing. The NHS says: Cyclospora is caught by consuming food – especially raw berries, herbs and salad items – or water contaminated with human faeces (poo) carrying the parasite. The parasite lives in the poo.  You can\u0027t catch cyclospora by coming into contact with an infected person, such as someone who hasn’t washed their hands after going to the toilet.  Once in the poo, the parasite takes about 10 days before becoming infectious. If cyclospora isn\u0027t treated, the illness may last from a few days to a month or longer.  Symptoms may seem to go away and then return more than once. It\u0027s common to feel very tired. If you think you have cyclospora, you\u0027re advised to see your GP to check your symptoms. Mention your recent travel history. Cyclospora is treated with a course of antibiotics called co-trimoxazole."},{"url":null,"title":"huge wine cellars helicopter pads","story":"NewsHuge Wine cellars, helicopter pads and private rivers: A very luxurious tour of the most spectacular houses in the worldA property with 50 bathrooms, a helicopter pad that vanishes beneath your lawn, a home cinema and bowling lane or what about a massive wine cellar and your own river?Share\u0026nbspByGrace ThompsonSteve Myall10:52, 7 AUG 2018Updated12:13, 7 AUG 2018NewsThis beautiful Los Angeles home has been valued at a whopping $180million recently and we can see why.

So does Matej and it’s been a good relationship.“Along with Neil Alexander, our coach, we have a goalie union and it is a fun working environment.“At the end of the day we all support each other and, whoever plays, that continues.“It’s good competition and it’s good for the team.“We prepare in training and whoever is picked, they will do their best. This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/pavol-safranko-857x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united set to announce slovakia international striker as 13th summer signing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are set to make their 13th signing of the summer by adding Slovakian striker Pavol Safranko to their ranks.The 23-year-old has been playing in Denmark with AaB, but reports from there have him on his way to Tannadice.It was know the Tangerines had been in advanced talks with another front man and Safranko fits the bill.The player’s agent, Emil Kavarovic, is quoted in the Slovakian media as saying: “In the case of Pavel, it is annual (contract), until summer 2019.“All the parties are already agreed.

The website looked at more than 100 locations and used the percentage of properties for sale with off-street parking – which provides an opportunity to install home charging points.It said just 50.4% had driveways or garages, just behind London’s 48.6%, while Poole in southern England came top with 91.9%.The Scottish Government has pledged to phase out new petrol and diesel cars and vans across Scotland by 2032, eight years ahead of the UK Government target, in a bid to reduce air pollution.Many drivers are expected to have charging points at home but public chargers will be needed for many motorists who live in flats and for drivers to use mid-journey.The council has made a big shift in recent years towards encouraging use of electric vehicles – particularly in the taxi industry.The new Princes Street charging hub, which opened last month, is used by almost 100 vehicles per day with some in the taxi industry describing it as the best in Scotland. There are more than 20 public charging posts in the city.Councillor Lynne Short, the council’s convener of city development, said the study failed to look at the bigger picture and added the city’s reliance on on-street parking is exactly why the authority is investing in public charging points.

He stays on the field and makes a good stop.”The manager, though, wasn’t too hard on his own goalkeeper despite the costly mistake.He added: “He was upset, that’s obvious. He came in and apologised to the boys, he’s made a mistake.“I’m not going to go through him because I thought he made some good stops in the first half, he’s coming out, he’s brave and taking crosses, plenty of them.”Midfielder Glen Kamara was left out of the squad sparking plenty of speculation that a departure was on the cards.

All the players are highly motivated to go out and prove that.“Although we are out of the Europa League, the two games against Burnley showed we are well placed.“Although we have lost some vital players, the manager has brought in some real quality.“Players are prepared to step up now and take responsibility for themselves.“Aberdeen is a special club and a massive club. We always want to push forward and be the best we can be.”In the aftermath of the draw Rangers boss Steven Gerrard slated Aberdeen. The rookie Ibrox boss claimed his side were “a class above Aberdeen” and that they “didn’t have an idea”.Showing the same composure and calmness he produces within the Reds’ back-line, Devlin refused to be drawn on the Liverpool legend’s comments.He said: “The Rangers manager is entitled to an opinion and I am not going to comment on that.“He can say what he wants about the game. We will analyse the game and where we think we are.”Aberdeen pushed Premier League Burnley to extra-time before losing 3-1, less than 72 hours before facing Rangers. Devlin insists that is no excuse for the flat performance.He said: “We spoke before the game and the gaffer made sure that would not be an excuse.“We are professional athletes and trained hard over pre-season to make sure that if it went into extra-time on Thursday, we were still ready to play at the weekend.“Rangers played on Thursday night as well so it is not really an excuse, to be honest.“We looked a bit lethargic and lacklustre in the opening 45 minutes. We got marginally better, although our use of the ball wasn’t quite good enough in the middle of the park and from the back-line, we moved it too slowly and were a bit predictable with our passes.“We should have got the lift when Rangers went down to 10 men and taken the impetus to drive on and try to get the goal.“It didn’t happen for us and it was Rangers that got the goal.“But we dug deep and showed a lot of desire and fight to get that goal through Bruce, which was brilliant for him.

could have on agriculture.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Conservative MP Michael Gove voiced their different opinions.Mr Gove was clear he believes Brexit has “big opportunities” .He said: “Brexit is a win-win as it could mean new markets for high quality Scottish produce and an opportunity to sell to new consumers.“One of the things we’re talking to the Scottish Government about is making sure we can provide farmers with support not only to access the new export market but in all other work they do.”Ms Sturgeon spoke about the troubles in a no-deal Brexit.She said: “A no-deal Brexit in my view is unthinkable and completely unacceptable and I would like to see the government and Prime Minister in particular, rule out any possibility of a no-deal Brexit.“The danger in the way the UK government are behaving is that they increase the risk of that happening even if it’s not ultimately what they want.“Let’s focus our energy on trying as hard as we can to avoid that outcome but there’s no doubt if the UK Government continues down the track it’s on the risk of that happening becomes far greater.“We are making any preparations we can such as the stability and simplicity consultation looking at how to ensure a stable transition.“The Scottish Government has argued for, if not EU membership, for customs union membership to protect the ability of the food and drink sector to continue to trade freely and protect the things about EU membership that matter.“Am I happy with the assurances? I think the honest answer for that would have to be no. I don’t think there is anything about the Brexit planning of the UK government that I would describe as satisfactory.”Mr Gove said the UK Government “wanted to ensure that European nations have access to our markets and products in an uninterrupted way and at the same time that we can take back control of our agricultural policy, farming policy and our borders”.HE added: “We want a deal but we are ready for every eventuality and we’re making appropriate provisions for whatever eventuality arises.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures aboyne highland games","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Highland games season on Royal Deeside got under way on Saturday when Aboyne Green played host to its 151st annual event.Thousands of visitors flocked to the Deeside village drawing a crowd of just over 9,500 from all corners of the globe to one of the oldest events of its kind."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b63f4096fedf-846x564.jpg ","title":"students are driving force at legendary silverstone","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university motorsport team has raced its way to take 9th place in a prestigious competition.TAU Racing, run by Aberdeen University students, took home the accolade at an international competition held at the historic Silverstone race track in Towcester, home of the Formula One British Grand Prix.TAU, along with other teams from across the world including America and Europe, took to the track at Silverstone for the Formula Student UK event, celebrating the weekend’s 20th anniversary.Arran Strutt, the 21-year-old project manager, said: “We’re absolutely ecstatic to have placed where we did, especially given the obstacles put in front of us.“We worked out that it took our 60 members a total of 11,000 hours to put this car together from the ground up.”The cars themselves, which cost TAU between £20,000 and £30,000, are built and rebuilt from scratch every year, using the knowledge of the students.Arran admits that some of the pricier parts may be kept, but the majority is all brand new.He said: “Each car is built from scratch. We manufacture the chassis ourself, and fully design the car from the ground up.“Sometimes we might even use systems that we’ve designed as part of our course.“Things are held over, in terms of expensive components, but the whole design is fresh.”The team overcame a setback on its Aberdeenshire test track to take part in the competition, which took place between July 13 and 15. The day before the competition, during test laps, a wheel assembly collapsed, prompting the skeleton crew to replace it with one used on a previous car.Arran said: “It was a very tense atmosphere, we had a skeleton crew of about five or six there, and it took a really big push to get everything sorted.“It’s fair to say that they all did a great job.”Far from being an engineering-only event, Arran also spoke of how multi-faceted the competition is, with each team having to submit a business case, including costings to judges, as well as securing sponsors to cover the costs of the car.The mechanical engineering student said: “We have business students as part of the team, who are tasked with putting together a business case, as if we were going to mass produce the car.”Arran also mentioned the positive impact the team has on students.He said: “There’s a huge student development side.“Engineering students can apply theoretical knowledge that you learn in class on to the car, and you can learn other skills that you might not, like the manufacturing side.”Professor Igor Guz, head of the university’s school of engineering, said: “I am delighted that TAU Racing has achieved another great result in this year’s Formula Student competition. The result is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the team, and demonstrates the opportunities open to students when they come to study at one of the UK’s top universities for engineering.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/07/P-607db904-bab1-4d00-a7ab-c409a6773aa9-940x529.jpg ","title":"tractor ban call for

September.For the whole campaign, the Evening Express, in print and online, will be the no.1 place for Lynx news across the age groups, match reports and reaction.The Evening Express logo will also feature on the club’s jerseys for the forthcoming term.Lynx chairman Martin Hill said: “I am delighted to enter into partnership with the Evening Express.“Their coverage of the club over the last few years has been a big help, I am sure, into making the Lynx one of the best-supported ice hockey clubs in Scotland and this new deal will help take that to the next level, featuring not just reports and stories about our SNL side, but also on our junior development programmes as well.“As a club that is fiercely proud of it’s local roots and location, it makes absolute sense that we partner with a newspaper that shares such an ethos, and I’m sure our fans will look forward to the increased coverage we will receive with excitement.”Evening Express editor Craig Walker said: “In our newspaper and online, the Evening Express strives to support and promote local sport.“The Aberdeen Lynx are a real success story, attracting close to 1,000 people to their home games at the Linx Ice Arena and continuing to grow year on year.“The ice hockey club’s senior side are second only to Aberdeen FC in terms of attendance in the north-east, and they also provide opportunities across the youth age groups.“This partnership will see continued, unrivalled coverage of the Lynx’s matches and other news and we look forward to working with them throughout the campaign.”The Lynx have announced their

the end of the 2019/20 season.Lynx chairman Martin Hill said: “We are immensely grateful to Kenny Mack and Davie Hale of LeMack for this extremely generous sponsorship deal, which is a massive boost to the club.“While we have a fan base that is the envy of some Elite League Ice Hockey Clubs, the club still have to balance the books.“Last season the club was running teams at Under-12, U14, U16, U20 and SNL, and with costs to the club in terms of coach hire for away games, ice hire for matches and training, purchasing new kit and so on always increasing, sponsorship from local business is a key income stream for the Lynx.“Sponsoring the Lynx also provides great exposure for local business, with crowds averaging almost 900 people, and over 300 replica shirts featuring our sponsor logos sold last season.“We are very proud to be associated with LeMack, a company, which, like ourselves, is a local success story – and look forward to this season bringing more success to the Linx Ice Arena”LeMack take over from two-year main sponsors Petrolink.LeMack’s Davie Hale said: “We at LeMack Oilfield Rentals Ltd are proud and honoured to be associated with and are the main sponsor for

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert tourist icentre to shut in october","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 9:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert\u0026#8217s tourist information centre will close in the autumn \u0026#8211 five months earlier than expected.The doors will close on October 27 this year, rather than in March 2019 as widely expected.The controversial decision to close a number of iCentres across Argyll, including those in Tarbert, Campbeltown and Inveraray, follows a recorded drop in footfall, according to the country\u0026#8217s tourism agency VisitScotland.Tarbert residents reacted angrily to the news, with one commenting on social media: ‘How can our small businesses grow when they are not being promoted?’Tarbert shop owner Ian MacIntyre agreed, saying the move ‘didn’t make a lot of sense’.He added: ‘I can’t understand why they’d close the centre in Tarbert.

We are confident our proposals have reached an optimum balance between these aspects.\u0026#8216As a responsible developer, we believe it is important to seek public opinion on our proposals and take that feedback into consideration when developing our projects.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crunch meeting on ardrishaig club future","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA meeting is to be held next month to gauge interest in reviving a Mid Argyll sailing club.Disquiet has been growing in Ardrishaig while weeds grow up around sailing boats and canoes belonging to Mid Argyll Water Sports Club.The boats, bought with the help of grant funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust, are lying on the Ardrishaig waterfront, unused in 2018.The Argyllshire Advertiser spoke to Peter Hogbin, who was involved in the club for many years.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them. And it has to be root and branch – every correspondence, every conversation, every e-mail – involving everyone from the Malaysian owners to our own Council executives and elected members. The council tax payers of South Ayrshire deserve the truth.

And John Scott MSP believes the 22 homes will breathe new life into an area, off McCall’s Avenue. Mr Scott visited the Britannia Place site, being developed by Hanover Scotland Housing Association, with funding from South Ayrshire Council and the Scottish Government. Builders are CCG (Scotland) Ltd, and the new development, once completed, will be known as Cuthbert Gardens. The name reflects the history of the site, which used to contain the Newton Shoe Factory owned by the Cuthbert family. People are expected to move into the general needs social housing, ranging from two to four bedrooms, early in 2019. Mr Scott met with senior managers from both Hanover Scotland and CCG and was given a tour of the site. He heard about valuable engagement with local residents during construction and how the design had come about, as well as health and safety precautions.  Janice McDonald is the Enhanced Housing Manger for Hanover Scotland. She said: “We already have nine developments in South Ayrshire, and Cuthbert Gardens is our tenth.” She added: “This area is important to future plans and we look forward to delivering more high quality social housing.” John Scott MSP added: “I am delighted to have been able to visit, and look forward to returning to Cuthbert Gardens when it is completed in the New Year. “My office receives regular calls from constituents looking for, in particular, ground level accommodation which is affordable. “So it is hugely welcome that Hanover Scotland and CCG are able to deliver this kind of new supply to the area.” Calum Murray, Director of CCG, said: “This now takes our overall number of homes presently under construction to 61 units. “By utilising ‘offsite’ methods of construction, these new homes will be constructed to the highest quality standard and thanks to a bespoke manufacturing process, their environmental performance will ensure long-term energy savings for the future residents. “CCG can also confirm that as a direct result of this project, we have been able to engage with local colleges to provide training and employment opportunities for the South Ayrshire community.” "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic ban town square cumnock","story":"NewsTraffic ban in Town Square in CumnockFears over congestion in nearby roadsShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:05, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailConcerns have been raised about traffic chaos when cars are banned from the Town Square in Cumnock.

Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work. Miss Jane Fergusson executed some remarkable wood carvings in St Andrew\u0026rsquos church and was instrumental in forming a local branch of the Band of Mercy.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-actor-lands-starring-role-in-theatre-royal-programme","story":"ACTORS from across the UK applied in their hundreds for the highly-regarded Theatre Royal education programme.\nAnd following a demanding audition process, one budding thespian from Melrose landed one of the 18 starring roles.\nAlexander Cowan will now embark on a year-long course of mentoring by top industry professionals, which in the past has included Royal Shakespeare Company voice coach Michael Corbridge and Ros Steen, the former head of vocal training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.\nSome of the acting world\u0026rsquos most famous names have trodden the boards at Newcastle\u0027s Theatre Royal including Dame Judy Dench and Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.\nAlexander is delighted to be joining them.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonia way cycling companion guidebook","story":"A comprehensive pedaling plan to the cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness was published last week.The 118 page handlebar bag sized spiral bound book, to guide cyclists on National Cycle Route 78, is so far available at Machrihanish Holiday Park, Patersons Bakery Carradale, Skipness Smokehouse and Argyll Backpackers at Inverneil.Independent publishers, The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Janet Moss and Pete Martin, visited Campbeltown last Thursday, from their Cumbria base, to launch the book\u0026#8217s first edition.It was the pair\u0026#8217s second visit since May when they put finishing touches to the production which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey maps of each section, a comprehensive accommodation guide and locations where cycle spares might be found.\u0026#8216We have cycled the route at least once in both directions although much of the research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat. For instance in Campbeltown Amelias, Food for Thought and Ceann Loch Diner are excluded.Neither of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s fish and chip shops are included, either in the listings or on the map, despite there being a map symbol for those takeaways.Many cyclists are inquisitive and will no doubt discover other options as the guide is just a starting point.The Caledonia Way may also appeal to motorised travellers as well as the self propelled.A separate concertina trip planner leaflet, inserted at the back of the book, shows a height cross section of the full route and is cross referenced to the accommodation providers.On the reverse of this route planner is a diagrammatic map, trip planning tool and mileage chart including a speech bubble stating: \u0026#8216Are there any more hills today.\u0026#8217The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Pete Martin and Janet Moss with their guidebook at the Campbeltown launch. 25_c31caledonia01_PeteMartin_Janet_Moss\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane august 3 2018","story":"In the days before rapid transatlantic flights, The Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Queen Elizabeth operated a weekly luxury liner service between Southampton and New York.A phone call, to the Southampton ferry and tug company Red Funnel, started a huge and challenging recovery exercise to refloat the 83,000 ton liner from the Bramble Bank.Tugs Canute, Clausentum, Neptune and Vulcan and Alexandra Towing Company\u0026#8217s Romey, Hornby and Poulsom were sent but soon it was realised more would be needed.Last week down memory lane featured the Royal Navy tug HMRT Bustler, a model of which is in Campbeltown museum.

More than six in 10 claim to have kept at least one of the postcards they’ve received over the years.’A spokesperson for Lyrical Scotland, which produces Mr McMillan\u0026#8217s best selling card, said: \u0026#8216Similarly to Royal Mail, we have seen a steady increase in our postcard sales to retailers, which we attribute to refreshing and modernizing our designs and images.\u0026#8216We continue to focus on both popular places of interest and the more unusual and interesting views and vistas of Scotland.\u0026#8217Michael McGregor is a photographer and postcard printer, based at Ardnamurchan and said that the days when he used to print a million cards a year are long gone.Mr MacGregor added: \u0026#8216However, many of the big players have left the market leaving us specialists.\u0026#8216If they are unusual of striking images tourists will often buy cards, not to post but to remember their trips.\u0026#8216We have a herd of Highland cattle and they are certainly cash cows for featuring in many postcards.\u0026#8217In 2001, before 9/11, one of Mr MacGregor\u0026#8217s cards was sent to a banker at Morgan Stanley.  It was found among the wreckage of the World Trade Centre\u0026#8217s twin towers and posted back to Ardnamurchan by a New York fireman.Andrew Wallace, 21, is a sales assistant in Cadenhead\u0026#8217s Whiskey Shop, he had an opposing view on postcards.He said: \u0026#8216We do not sell many postcards, I think that this is because people are using social media instead\u0026#8217.He also admitted: \u0026#8216I have never sent a postcard, it\u0026#8217s a thing of the past and we are heading into a paperless world.\u0026#8216I think that this may be a good thing.\u0026#8217When asked about his view on the future demand of postcards, and if he believes that more people should purchase them, Mr McMillan laughed and said: \u0026#8216They certainly should because I\u0026#8217d make more money.\u0026#8217All postcard images are used with permission of the copyright holders.George McMillan\u0026#8217s best selling card.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

Serco, who agreed to suspend any action for 21 days, now have three weeks to respond in writing.  Living Rent tenant\u0027s union were yesterday supporting a refugee whose fate has been left undecided by the plans.  Khalil, who is originally from Iran, has lived in the city for three years after a traumatic journey to Britain.  The 34-year-old had to walk for seven days from Iran through Turkey before getting on the back of a lorry, which ended up in Manchester.  He was physically assaulted during the journey before eventually being sent to Glasgow by the Home Office.  He said: \u0026ldquoI feel safe in Glasgow. I can relate it to my original home because it has a proper community like back home.  \u0026ldquoBut I live day to day as my situation can change at a moments notice. The waiting is too much, three years I have waited, the hardest thing is waiting.  \u0026ldquoPhysiologically it takes it toll, I came here not for money or to take, I came here for safety and to work and provide for myself\"  \"Glasgow is my second home, my first home has been destroyed. I\u0027ve made friends here and built a life here. The only issue I have is with the Home office process and the length of time it takes. I just want my rights, I just want to live in peace and work and provide for myself.  Khalil is one of hundreds to have received a letter from Serco informing him of plans which will potentially make him homeless.  He added: \u0026ldquoI have no rights I have nowhere to go, what am I supposed to do?  \u0026ldquoI\u0027m putting my appeals and all the paperwork into the Home Office for my interview and then to be told I\u0027m to be made homeless was devastating\"  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove had no official help, from anyone at all.

Craig Paterson, spokesperson for the union, said: \"We have come here today to support Khalil and to show him and SERCO the strength of of feeling in Glasgow.  \"We fully intend to defend our neighbours and our communities by any and all means necessary\"  Shelter Scotland\u0026rsquos principal solicitor Fiona McPhail, said: \u0026ldquoShelter Scotland is pleased that the case brought on behalf of two clients has been continued and we will be able to challenge the so-called \"lock change\" evictions planned by Serco. We will be back in Glasgow Sheriff Court in 21 days.  \u0026ldquoThe nature of the proceedings of this stage, was for interim orders, which are effectively an emergency prohibition or prevention.  \u0026ldquoBecause there\u0026rsquos an undertaking that no action is going to be taken, which we believe is in part of the legal proceedings raised by us and others over the weekend, those orders weren\u0026rsquot necessary.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot yet say how long this will take and how the court will view our different arguments but at this stage we\u0026rsquove got an agreement there will be no action for 21 days, we\u0026rsquoll be back here and we\u0026rsquoll be update further at that stage.  Miss McPhail said Shelter were instructed on August 3, and the position is that 21 days isn\u0026rsquot going to be enough to have the areas of law clarified.  The legal arguments are complex and Shelter asked for longer, but the court granted 21 days.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhat the court have asked is for the other side to state their defence to the case so the court and us have an understanding of their position in writing.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a massive temporary victory for these six individuals and we know from the statement issued on Saturday that everyone else will not be served notices while these legal issues are clarified.

The 64-year-old was a postgraduate student at Glasgow University when his family was torn apart just months after Hussein came to power in 1979.  They were among countless Iraqi citizens deported to Iran, while his older brother Jamal was held hostage with 11 of his cousins and sent to the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. He was last seen in 1984.  Over the years that followed, Mr Ketuly collected crucial evidence of the atrocities committed by the dictator, adding to the charges which eventually led to Hussein\u0026rsquos execution in 2006.  He also helped journalists \u0026ndash including from The Herald \u0026ndash enter Iraq to report on the violence and upheaval there.  His presidential bid comes amid the continuing fallout from May\u0026rsquos parliamentary elections, which were marred by allegations of widespread fraud.  Mr Ketuly hopes his position as an outside, independent candidate will garner support from Iraq\u0026rsquos divided politicians and parties, as well as demonstrators calling for change.

If I win the presidency, I want to bring together all of the divergent ethnic and religious groups and political factions to develop Iraq socially, scientifically and economically, in order to see the country flourish.  \u0026ldquoIraq has struggled for too long and the time has come to restore peace, stability and unity for the benefit of the nation\u0026rsquos 37 million citizens.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe want to get the image of Iraq cleaned and let people see the real Iraq, building relationships with outside powers and opening up Iraq to the world.  Mr Ketuly splits his time between Glasgow\u0026rsquos Ruchill area and Iraq, where he lectures at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Duhok.  He worked at Glasgow University until the early 1990s, and sought asylum in the city when his family was deported and their possessions seized.  An Iraqi Kurd born in Baghdad, he has already been in contact with the country\u0026rsquos Kurdish parties, which are split into two different factions and have yet to put forward any candidate.  The academic said he will push for \u0026ldquopeace and stability if his bid is successful, while attempting to reverse the destruction caused by decades of war and upheaval.  As well as mass rebuilding, he wants to secure better environmental protection and improve the use of water and energy resources \u0026ndash including by constructing solar panel fields in the deserts of western Iraq.  While estimating he has a slim chance of success, Mr Ketuly added: \u0026ldquoWhen the new Iraqi parliament starts, we have a petition for the new MPs to see what kind of support they would give somebody like me. I will go and speak to the various MPs in the Iraqi parliament to see how they will feel.  Iraq\u0027s elections earlier this year were won by an alliance led by Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shia cleric who previously came to prominence after leading violent uprisings against US troops.  Mr Ketuly\u0027s bid comes after Hassan Rouhani, who was a postgraduate student at Glasgow Caledonian University in the 1990s, was elected president of neighbouring Iran in 2013.  Mr Rouhani, who even included Glasgow Caledonian in his election campaign video, recently hit the news after invoking the ire of US President Donald Trump when he warned: \"America should know peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.  Yesterday, the UK and EU partners said they would move to block Mr Trump\u0026rsquos decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran in order to preserve peace."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8169020.jpg?type=article-full","title":"poorest-scots-families-locked-out-of-jobs-market-by-unaffordable-and-unreliable-local-transport","story":"  That\u0027s the view of a new report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which examined issues for the unemployed in Port Glasgow and Castlemilk and revealed that the accessibility of key areas of employment using public transport is often \"very restricted\".  The researchers said that the \"unreliability\" of local buses is at risk of creating new \u0026lsquocut-off commuter zones\u0026rsquo where people are unable to consistently guarantee punctuality when travelling longer distances for work.  This \"serious disconnect\" between the location of jobs and low-income neighbourhoods was \"constraining people\u0026rsquos ability to seize job opportunities when they arise\", according to the report.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspOne million missing out due to poor transport links  They called on the Scottish Government, local authorities and transport bodies to act to ensure bus franchising powers are used to \"improve the availability, affordability and reliability of services, to make it easier for people on low incomes to access employment\".  They said the planning process should be improved to ensure new housing and employment developments are well served by public transport.  They said that Port Glasgow ought to be well connected to the wider city region, given the range of potential transport modes available, including bus and rail.  But the study observed that \"significant portions\" of the city region are more than an hour away by public transport, including much of Glasgow.    While Castlemilk was around five-and-a-half miles to Glasgow city centre and would take typically around 30 minutes at 8am in a car, the journey takes around 45 minutes by public transport but, but that is if services run on time.  The study conducted by Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Sheffield said transport was consistently highlighted as a significant barrier to work once the trade-off between the cost, reliability and speed of local public transport and the prospect of low-wage, insecure work was considered.  For many low-income families the cost of purchasing and then running their own car was not affordable and makes them fully reliant on public transport.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspPoor services for bus users in national park  The study said concerns were raised that due to the \"insecure and competitive nature\" of the jobs, residents were going for, \"poor productivity caused by delays that could easily result in a reduction of their hours or being let go\".  One 61-year-old Port Glasgow resident told researchers he had to give up a job as a security guard on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Paisley because of a combination of transport issues and job insecurity. The commute involved catching a bus from his house to Port Glasgow railway station to get the train to Paisley, followed by a bus ride to his place of work for a 12-hour shift between 5pm and 5am.  The journey usually took over an hour each way but delays could significantly lengthen his commute and long working day.  \"I was leaving the house at half three [in the afternoon] and I wasn\u0026rsquot getting home the next morning till eight [in the morning], then get four hours sleep and get back up and go back again,\" he said.  A 48-year-old woman from Castlemilk added: \"It could be a nightmare. If a bus doesn\u0027t turn up, you could get the sack. It affects the house and everything. I hate being late. It puts me off changing [buses]. Employers expect you to be there nine to five. If you\u0027re not, it\u0027s like, \u0027Right, out the door!\u0027\"    Brian Robson, acting head of policy and research at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos unacceptable that large numbers of people seeking work are being locked out of job opportunities simply because of poor public transport connections. The experiences of low-income residents make it abundantly clear that we must properly invest in transport networks within cities not just between them.  \u0026ldquoCurrently unaffordable and unreliable public transport is holding people back from being able to achieve a better standard of living. With more powers being devolved to city and local leaders, now is the time to redesign our transport, housing and economic policies so that everyone can get into work and progress in their careers.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to supporting services and tackling the historic decline in bus passenger numbers. The Transport (Scotland) Bill will support local authorities to meet local needs, whether they wish to pursue partnership working, local franchising, or running their own buses where appropriate. \u0026nbspLocal authorities can already run their own services in some limited circumstances, as some do. The Bill extends these powers.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government is investing up to \u0026pound96m in Fair Start Scotland, a new devolved employability support service to help people find work.

His suggestion for widening access was maintenance grants, rather than loans, for the poorest students.  There\u0026rsquos a sort of economic law at work here, too. The customer demands results (in this case, better access for poorer students) as a return on payment, while the provider says the desired result can\u0026rsquot be achieved for that cost.  The differences in university funding across the UK complicated matters. The Scottish Government is committed (until Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos taxpayer-funded rock outside Heriot-Watt University melts with the sun) to paying tuition fees for Scottish students and must thus do the same for EU students, unless they are English. For, you know, reasons.  That money comes from taxpayers, including non-graduates. In practice, the English loan system may not be all that different. In theory it amounts to a graduate tax a salary deduction of nine per cent for most of a graduate\u0026rsquos working life, with the lowest earners having their payments indefinitely deferred.  In practice, it\u0026rsquos worse, because \u0026ndash on current projections \u0026ndash taxpayers, including non-graduates, will write off 80 per cent of the student loan book at the end of the 30-year term, handing the money (\u0026pound110 billion and rising at 10 per cent a year) to the banks.  Even Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos plan (since dropped) to write off English student loans was better, since it would at least have avoided the interest payments. Had it been affordable, which it wasn\u0026rsquot.  It\u0026rsquos not clear, though, that the Scottish system, despite its egalitarian intentions, is an improvement. In fact, it\u0026rsquos clear that it\u0026rsquos not, if access to universities by the most deprived young people is the aim. In England, the poorest students are 2.4 times less likely to go to university, and in Wales and Northern Ireland three times less likely. In Scotland, it\u0026rsquos four times less likely.  Because politicians and university administrators tend to be bureaucrats, the row about access for the poorest students and those from minority backgrounds is usually focused on considerations such as social mobility. That\u0026rsquos not the central function of a university, though, even if it is a desirable by-product.  Cardinal Newman, for example, in The Idea of the University, argued that they should provide reflection and instruction to foster \u0026ldquothe culture of the intellect putting the emphasis on universal scope of study, rather than universality of access.  Purists or, if you prefer, elitists, may argue that personal intellectual development is what matters at university. Unfortunately for them, the customers, whether it\u0026rsquos the Government or students themselves, don\u0026rsquot seem to agree. And when you expect financial or social gains, you calculate costs.  Since at least the time of Plato, whose name is still very occasionally bandied about in lecture rooms, there has been a prevailing notion that education is a matter of concern not just to children and parents, but to the whole of society \u0026ndash and that society gains from its utility and should be involved in its provision.  Theorists differed on how Rousseau and his much later disciple John Dewey went for the anti-intellectual, child-centred approach. John Stuart Mill wanted universal education to be required by the state, but on no account to be provided by it.  A depressing number of teachers and lecturers were persuaded by the Marxist view that education is a vital weapon in the class war or, since the 1960s, by the post- or neo-Marxist analytic approach, where the crucial thing is to allow students to develop their own values. The subsequent growth of relativism and disregard for objective truth or free speech now evident in some universities is the result.  But plenty of liberals, Whigs and traditional conservatives valued social mobility as an educational outcome, too (though to protect and expand the bourgeoisie, rather than to overthrow it). That accounts for the Tory enthusiasm for grammar schools. And, by all objective measures, social mobility in 20th century Britain, coinciding with universal education, was much higher than in many other countries.  The problem for our current university system is that, since the expansions of the Major and Blair governments, the supposed advantages education provides for social and financial advancement have been much more widely offered, and expected.  When only 10 or 15 per cent of the population attended university, fees and grants could come from general taxation, and though it was a raw deal for those who didn\u0026rsquot go but footed the bill, the overall benefit could be thought reasonable. If a majority go to university, it is much more unfair that the (almost certainly poorer) minority of the population who don\u0026rsquot end up shouldering the costs.  The current arrangement is unsatisfactory graduates (even in Scotland) have huge debts but, because there are so many of them, no longer always get \u0026ndash though many still expect \u0026ndash better-paid jobs that were the norm until the early 1990s. A degree is now required for plenty of poorly-paid jobs, and is no guarantee of social or financial advancement.  The Russell Group, in a way, embodies that. It\u0026rsquos the UK\u0026rsquos most successful and, generally, oldest universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh (though not St Andrews, which figures high in league tables, but isn\u0026rsquot a member). It\u0026rsquos, by and large, the university system as it was before 1994.  One solution that preserves their academic elitism and admission standards while encouraging access for more deprived students is to combine the maintenance grant and free tuition by expanding a system most of these universities have long operated: open competitive bursaries. The difficulty is that those from disadvantaged backgrounds tend to fare less well in such tests, because they have been poorly taught at school.  But \u0026ndash assuming universities can lay their hands on some brainy people to do it \u0026ndash tests can be designed to identify potential as well as existing knowledge. Where necessary, they could be supplemented with initiatives already provided by some universities, such as summer schools and foundation courses, to allow wider access. Devise, in other words, scholarships that don\u0026rsquot compromise scholarship."},{"url":null,"title":"replica-of-mackintosh-tea-rooms-stunning-centrepiece-to-be-installed-in-restored-building","story":"  The Willow Wood gesso panel was a sculptural relief created by Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos wife Margaret Macdonald and served as the centrepiece in Miss Cranston\u0026rsquos most extravagant room, the Salon de Luxe.

In an effort to persuade EU leaders to accept Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit, a series of Cabinet ministers warned last week that a chaotic no-deal was increasingly likely.  On Sunday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox put the odds on crashing out next March without a deal on trade, customs or a transition period as high as 60-40.  He blamed \u0026ldquointransigence and inflexible thinking by officials for continued EU resistance to the Chequers plan, which would cherry-pick arrangements on goods, services and migration. Ms Sturgeon said the heavy-handed \u0026ldquoscare tactics got in the way of more productive talks.  She said: \u0026ldquoA no-deal Brexit would be utterly unacceptable and deeply damaging, but by talking it up as a negotiating tactic there is a very real danger it becomes a reality.  \u0026ldquoWhile the UK\u0026rsquos focus is on scare tactics of no deal, there has no visible progress on securing a future relationship that protects trade in goods and services.  Today\u0026rsquos meeting is the first between the leaders since March, when Ms Sturgeon complained the UK was undermining devolution with the EU Withdrawal Bill.  In the months since, relations between the two governments have nosedived, with the passing of the bill into statute and arguments over the constitution.  In June, SNP MPs walked out of Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions and forced an emergency debate on the Sewel Convention after accusing ministers of treating Scotland with contempt.  The UK Government\u0026rsquos law officers also tried to have Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill struck down at the Supreme Court last month.  The Prime Minister will visit the Edinburgh Festival and sign off a \u0026pound1.2 billion City Deal for the capital and south-east Scotland to support innovation, infrastructure, housing and culture. She will say Brexit can result in a \u0026ldquobrighter future for the whole United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThese City Deals build on existing strengths to open up new possibilities for the future in Scotland and the whole of the UK as part of our modern Industrial Strategy.  \u0026ldquoAs we leave the EU, the UK Government is working in partnership with business, academia and the devolved administrations to create more good jobs and spread economic prosperity across the country. By making the most of our country\u0026rsquos assets and the talents of all of our people, we can build a brighter future for the whole UK.  Ms Sturgeon said Mrs May had two key challenges before the October meeting of EU leaders: to secure a withdrawal deal and orderly transition, and to get a detailed agreement on future UK-EU relations to let businesses and individuals plan with confidence. This would avoid a vague, confidence.  This would avoid a vague, so-called \u0026ldquoblind Brexit, and let Parliament vote on the deal.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the Chequers proposals falling flat, even if a withdrawal agreement can be secured, there is a very real risk that we end up with a blind Brexit, which will see the UK step off the cliff edge next March without knowing what landing place will be.  \u0026ldquoThat would do as much harm to jobs, investment and the economy as a no-deal Brexit, and would leave the country directionless through the transition period. Given this lack of clarity and real concerns of no agreement, it is time the Prime Minister told us what her Plan B is.  We cannot have no deal and we cannot have a blind Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThe whole of the UK deserves answers. We cannot continue without a back-up plan.  A survey published by the Fraser of Allander think-tank yesterday found 75 per cent of Scots businesses felt in the dark about Brexit and most blamed the UK Government.  Greater clarity would also help Ms Sturgeon decide whether to push for a second independence referendum, something she planned to do in the autumn, but which could be derailed by uncertainty and delay over Brexit.  Ms Sturgeon will also call on the PM to address recent cross-party criticism from MPs that, after 20 years, the UK Government machine still does not fully respect or understand devolution.  She said there had to be \u0026ldquoconstructive and genuine  discussions on Scotland having a proper role in future negotiations.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government needs to start listening to the views of the people of Scotland, end the power-grab and start respecting the Scottish Parliament, she said.  Funded by \u0026pound300 million each from the UK and Scottish governments and \u0026pound500m from councils in Fife, Edinburgh, Scottish Borders and the Lothians, the City Deal aims to create 21,000 jobs.

Neither the politan Police, which has been leading the investigation into the attack, nor the CPS was prepared to discuss the report.  The Home Office said that as a matter of long-standing policy and practice, the UK would neither confirm nor deny an extradition request had been made or received until such time as an arrest has been made in relation to that request.  The report comes after the Press Association disclosed last month that investigators believed they had identified the suspected perpetrators of the attack and were sure they were Russian.  A source with knowledge of the inquiry said they had been identified through cross-checking CCTV footage with records of people entering the country around the time of the attack.

It comes after the Office of the Advocate General in Scotland granted the firm\u0027s client support for housing and subsistence following a new application for asylum.  The accommodation provider announced a rolling plan of lock changes in cases where asylum applications have been refused and tenants have not moved on.  A week after the policy emerged, Serco announced on Saturday it will pause the plan amid the anticipated legal challenge.  Principle solicitor Mike Dailly claimed his client and partner could still be at risk of eviction if support ended in the same way as 330 other asylum seekers under the threat in Glasgow.  The case is still set to go before the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday to debate the law.  Mr Dailly added: \"Accordingly there is no need for an interim interdict hearing at the Court of Session tomorrow morning in Edinburgh, but our client\u0027s court action will proceed in terms of the legal principles in dispute.\"  The firm wants Serco to put all similar proceedings on hold until the Court of Session can rule on the issue, rather than for a 21-day period.  Housing and homeless charity Shelter Scotland is also taking action and presented papers at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday on behalf of two asylum seekers facing eviction and the case was continued.

However, a new celebration of that production has caused unease within the family of one of its key architects.  The \"legendary\" 1948 production was directed by Tyrone Guthrie, and was performed from an abridged, edited and adapted Scots text by the writer Robert Kemp - an event marked at this year\u0027s Festival to signal its 70th anniversary.  The family of Kemp have now expressed their irritation and disquiet that their father\u0027s crucial work in refining and editing the vast play has not been credited by the 2018 festival.  David Kemp, the son of Robert Kemp, and the brother of the late editor of The Herald, Arnold Kemp, is dismayed that his father\u0027s crucial work has been overlooked by the EIF.  Read more: The EIF programme revealed for 2018  Today, the director Joe Douglas and the dramaturg Ian Brown will lead a presentation of a new version of the play, and a discussion on how it might be presented to a modern audience.  Mr Kemp, however, is anxious that his father\u0027s contribution is not forgotten.  In the this year\u0027s festival programme, Guthrie, the director, is mentioned, but the writer and adaptor of the 1948 version, Mr Kemp, who died in 1967, is not.  David Kemp, a retired TV producer, said: \"I think it is a real insult to him that he should be ignored in this way.  \"There is no mention of him at all.  \"I do not want to be strident about it, but I would like to say that the Kemp family are upset by this, the lack of mention of his work.\"  He added: \"I am surprised the Festival Society did not twig to this, and say: we are dealing with our own history here, let\u0027s get it right.  \"He wrote other plays at the festival: he was a central and seminal figure.\"  Jackie Kemp, a business content creator and grand-daughter of Robert, added: \"Robert Kemp\u0026rsquos reworking of the Three Estates was a huge achievement.  \"Robert was a gifted playwright and storyteller who spoke and wrote in Scots - but he was also a scholar of the language, with a deep knowledge of its literature and history.  \"He is part of a tradition and would be happy to see others reworking the original text - but I think he deserves to be remembered and recognised for his contribution.\"  Read more: A Festival future for Leith Theatre?  Mr Kemp noted that he was still waiting for an apology for the oversight.  A statement from the EIF said: \"The rehearsed reading presented by the International Festival, Lyceum Theatre and National Theatre of Scotland, uses extracts adapted from the original 16th century play by Sir David Lindsay, rather than the 1948 work adapted by Robert Kemp and directed by Tyrone Guthrie.  \"The International Festival recognises Robert Kemp\u0026rsquos enormous contribution to the landmark 1948 production and the extraordinary legacy of this piece, which continues to inspire theatre makers to this day.\"  The play was first performed at Linlithgow Palace, probably in the Banqueting Hall in 1540, before King James V and the queen, Marie de Lorraine.  In his written introduction to The Satire of the Three Estates, Robert Kemp, writing in 1948, said he hoped his notes show how he \"tackled the problem of making an old Scottish classic actable by modern actors and comprehensible to a modern audience, whilst doing the least possible violence to it.\"  He added: \"When the Festival Committee announced that Scottish drama was to be represented by a four hundreds year old morality play, which had not held the stage in the interval and did not so much as figure in the leaving certificate examinations, even the most patriotic seemed to feel that here was boldness to the point of recklessness.\"  Mr Kemp\u0027s version was cut until the play last around two hours.

The teenager was training with the Glasgow ski racing team in Austria in December 2016 when he crashed and hit his head on a fence post.  A third-year pupil at the time and aged 14, he spent a month in hospital in Innsbruck and was transferred to Glasgow by air ambulance with a further six-and-a-half weeks in Scottish hospitals.  But after weeks in intensive care, doctors told his family he had a one percent chance of making a full recovery as he had to learn how to walk, talk and eat again.  But Ross, a pupil at Williamwood High School in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, made dramatic improvements and walked out of hospital in February last year before returning to school full-time about three months later.  Now he has achieved seven As and one B in his National 5 exams, while also returning to competitive skiing.  He will return to Williamwood next week for fifth year, is unsure what he will do after school, but will make sure skiing is still part of his life.  He said: \u0026ldquoAfter my accident I had to learn how to do basic tasks again, such as walking and talking, but when I did eventually return to school they were really helpful.  \"I initially just went back for shorter days and my teachers helped me catch up on work I\u0026rsquod missed \u0026ndash so when I went back full-time I was prepared.  \"When the exams came round I felt ready for them but I really did not expect to get the results I have \u0026ndash but I\u0026rsquom really pleased.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:42

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Tuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news – sooner or later, we’ll all reach the end of our lives. Many of us are not keen to face this event, nor the time that comes directly before. It’s actually hard to say what is the bigger taboo, death or the personal care that most of us receive in our final days and weeks.            According to the World Health Organisation, more than half of us die of an illness that requires some form of end of life care. Depending on your definitions, the figure can be much higher – a German study found it to be more like four out of five, which is in line with findings from my work in Scotland. Either way, care providers expect the absolute numbers of people in Western countries in need of end-of-life care to keep growing as populations continue to grow older in future.            As you might expect, older people have a higher chance of developing ailments that need care. The group of those experiencing a long period of dwindling physical and mental faculties due to frail old age or dementia is already rising: according to the death records that we examined in Scotland, for example, it doubled from 5.1 per cent in 2001-02 to 9.7 per cent in 2011-12, and dementia rates have continued to increase. The share of people undergoing shorter periods of decline, such as cancer patients, rose to 29.5 per cent of all deaths in 2011-12. These numbers are slightly higher than many other countries, but roughly comparable.Given these figures, you may wonder: what is life like at its end? Do people receive the care and support they need? The answer is, not everyone does. My colleague Iain Atherton and I mapped the last year of people’s lives in Scotland using a mixture of census data NHS data, and death records. Here’s what we found out.READ MORE: Private care home chief warns sector is ‘on the brink’We looked at all 53,517 people who died in Scotland within a year of the last census in 2011. About one in five were below pension age, half were aged 65-84, and just under a third were 85 or older. Every third person lived alone, and around 40 per cent were widowed. Not the ideal situation when you need care.The closer people were to dying, the more likely they were to have moved in with others. This varied by neighbourhood deprivation, however. In more deprived areas, 37 per cent of people aged 70 and over – those most likely to need care – still lived alone, even in the last four weeks of their lives. In the least deprived areas, the rate was 25 per cent. (In this age group as a whole, 18 per cent of people died in a care home.)            To my knowledge, nobody has come up with directly comparable figures for other countries. From Eurostat data from 2014, though, we do know that 32 per cent of over-65s in the EU live alone, for example, and that the UK is almost exactly in line with the average.Let’s be honest: few people find the idea of living alone in old age appealing, no matter what their health status. In many cases, it goes hand-in-hand with depending on external services for care – strangers that invade the innermost sphere of your privacy. It’s probably one of the major reasons why people don’t like talking about this stage of life.Yet if we want to make our last months and years of life less bleak, talking and acting is exactly what we need to do. As I have just discussed at a show at the Edinburgh Fringe on the subject, we should consider new options. We need to think outside the box, and ensure that we are the decision-makers instead of being pushed back into the role of dependent.READ MORE: Let elderly Scots keep beloved pets in care homes, says Labour            Are retirement villages an option, for example? Or better still, housing complexes with people from different generations, where even a frail grandad can help the neighbour’s boy with his homework and still feel part of the community? Or can you band together with some friends, either in one house or in adjacent flats?In many cases, care decisions are made ad hoc, because an immediate solution is required. When your mother has had yet another fall and it’s clear she can no longer stay on her own and needs a care home bed in two days when she comes out of the hospital, there is no time to find the best home for her. You must take the place that is available.Isn’t it funny that many of us tend to take out life insurance in case we die prematurely but don’t make provisions for the very likely possibility that we’ll need care? I doubt you look forward to your care home stay, the tightly scheduled visit of the district nurse, or the look on the face of your children when they need to decide whether they want to sell the house they grew up in to pay for better care for you.Rich or poor, man or woman, the clock is ticking for all of us. Too many older people are facing the most vulnerable stage in their adult lives alone, and the next generation needs to find ways of avoiding this situation. It’s not to say that governments and healthcare providers shouldn’t take responsibility for care – they do anyway – but if we blindly rely on them to provide, there are limits to what we will receive. Before it’s too late, it’s better that we also come up with plans of our own.            Anna Schneider is a research fellow in social policy at Edinburgh Napier University.

The best-laid schemes for the average week at Westminster are normally in tatters by Monday lunchtime.                But amid the hurly-burly, I’ve watched the slow-motion car crash of the Tories’ failure to tackle the challenge to devolution posed by Brexit with a mixture of frustration and anger. Now that abject failure has been called out in a report from the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. Every warning ignored. Every amendment opposed. Every golden opportunity to fix the problem squandered. Many of the consequences of a Leave vote have been surprising. The potential for conflict with the devolution settlement is not. The fault lines were there but Brexit, the transfer of further powers to Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and the English metro mayors, coupled with the inflexibility of our constitution has turned them into dangerous cracks.            READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: Is Scotland that real ‘vassal’ state?            The game has changed. That’s why at every stage of the EU Withdrawal Bill we have tried to strengthen the role of the Joint Ministerial Committee and enshrine those intergovernmental relationships in legislation. We called for regular reports to Parliament and for minutes to be published in the interest of transparency. Instead, we got David Mundell, the invisible man in Cabinet. A figure who has made himself so superfluous to requirements that he is not considered worthy of a seat at the inner Brexit Cabinet table. For a Scottish Secretary from a party which claims to be a defender of the union, that is playing fast and loose with it.Instead of closing down the potential routes for grievance by establishing a formal role for the devolved governments, he has turned inaction into an artform, all the time sleepwalking into a position which has the nationalists rubbing their hands with glee at the mischief they can make from it. If Scotland’s two governments put cause before country every time, then we must put formal structures in place to ensure co-operation and guarantee respect for the settled will of the people. Make no mistake. I take no pleasure in having been proved right. Just as John Smith warned more than a quarter of a century ago, there are two parties sawing away at the legs that support the union. There is no hiding place for David Mundell when this damning verdict comes from a cross-party committee chaired by a Conservative MP.

Only the narrow separatist agenda of the SNP is being served by this impasse. It is a blank canvas onto which they project every gripe. Amid the arguments about Brexit, such simplistic messaging holds dangerously broad appeal. Yet we have an emasculated Scotland Office, with no permanent staff, failing to grasp the thistle. That is why a Labour government will establish a Constitutional Convention to advise on reforming the way post-Brexit Britain works and if the current arrangement is serving the people well enough by ensuring there is an adequate redistribution of power as well as wealth.Even if the Tories cannot bring themselves to admit we got it right, a starting point would be to get to work on delivering the recommendations in this report – but I won’t hold my breath.Lesley Laird MP is Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779673.1533620089!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit nicola sturgeon urges theresa may to set out plan b","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May will be urged to set out a \u0026#8220Plan B\u0026#8221 for Brexit during crunch talks with Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh today amid growing fears that the UK will leave the EU without a deal.                  The Prime Minister has said ahead of the meeting that the Brexit aftermath can lead to the spread of “economic prosperity across the country.”             But it comes as a stark survey of businesses north of the Border warns of a negative economic impact of life outside the EU for Scotland with “uncertainty in the UK government’s negotiating position” criticised.            The leaders meet with relations between Westminster and Holyrood at an all-time low as both governments are locked in an unprecedented constitutional battle at the UK Supreme Court over claims of a power grab on the Scottish Parliament.Mrs May will sign off £600 million  of city deal funding for Edinburgh as she visits the capital and agree millions more in further investment north of the Border.The trip  will be dominated by ongoing concerns over Brexit, though, with Ms Sturgeon poised to step up the pressure on the Prime Minister as  negotiations in Brussels show little sign of breakthrough with just seven months until the UK’s departure.UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned at the weekend the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit now looks the most likely scenario. It would mean hefty tariffs for firms exporting into Europe and questions over the future of EU nationals living here.But Mrs May said ahead of today’s visit: “As we leave the EU, the UK Government is working in partnership with business, academia and the devolved administrations to create more good jobs and spread economic prosperity across the country.            “By making the most of our country’s assets and the talents of all of our people, we can build a brighter future for the whole UK.”Read more: Nicola Sturgeon leads Britain’s most influential woman pollThe UK government has been touting its plans for Brexit agreed at Chequers – including plans for a common rulebook on all goods – to the EU and its leaders. But the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier already appears to have rejected the plan, prompting widespread concern that a “no deal” scenario seems inevitable.  The First Minister will today call on Mrs May to set out a “Plan B” to secure agreement on withdrawal and also lay the groundwork for the UK’s post-Brexit future.            “A no deal Brexit would be utterly unacceptable and deeply damaging, but by talking it up as a negotiating tactic there is a very real danger it becomes a reality,” Ms Sturgeon said ahead of the meeting.“With the Chequers proposals falling flat, even if a withdrawal agreement can be secured, there is a very real risk that we end up with a blind Brexit – which will see the UK step off the cliff edge next March without knowing what landing place will be.“That would do as much harm to jobs, investment and the economy as a no deal Brexit and would leave the country directionless through the transition period.“Given this lack of clarity and real concerns of no agreement, it is time the Prime Minister told us what her Plan B is.   We cannot have no deal and we cannot have a blind Brexit. “The whole of the UK deserves answers from the Prime Minister and we cannot continue without a back up plan.”            A new survey of 350 firms north of the border conducted out by the respect Fraser of Allander Institute think tank paints an increasingly gloomy picture of the post-Brexit economic landscape in Scotland.Only 6 per cent said the Brexit decision had a positive impact on their business, with 44 per cent saying it had been damaging. It also found three-quarters of firms said they had not received enough information about leaving the European Union to allow them to plan for the different possible outcomes of Brexit – with 59 per cent blaming “uncertainty in the UK’s government’s objectives” in the negotiations as the key factor in this.An agreed settlement still remains the probable result of the ongoing Brexit talks, a spokesman for the Prime Minister said yesterday, but  there is a risk negotiations may fail.“We continue to believe that a deal is the most likely outcome, because reaching a good deal is not only in the interests of the UK, it is in the interests of the EU and its 27 members,” he added.“But the Trade Secretary is right to say there is a risk of the negotiations not succeeding and the government has to prepare for all eventualities.”The spokesman said the Brexit White Paper published last month following the Cabinet summit at Chequers was recognised by Brussels as “a significant move.”“Following the publication of the White Paper, we are now in a serious conversation across a broad range of issues with the EU,” he said.“They recognise that the White Paper represents a significant move by the UK and now they need to respond.”Former Brexit secretary David Davis has warned that the EU will be making a “massive miscalculation” if it thinks the UK is not ready to walk away from talks without a deal.“This has great scope for being a massive miscalculation on the part of the EU that could end up with no deal by accident,” Mr Davis said“It’s certainly not the intention of the EU to have a no-deal Brexit but they are misjudging us at the moment. The UK Parliament does not want no deal but it’s certainly not going to be pushed around by the European Parliament.”Chancellor Philip Hammond has also privately warned City bankers to seek non-European business in preparation for possible restrictions on access to EU markets, it was reported yesterday.Ms Sturgeon has already indicated that she plans to a second independence referendum after Brexit once the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU become clear, but that is unlikely to be the focus of today’s talks.The UK Supreme Court is currently considering an unprecedented constitutional clash between Westminster and Holyrood. It comes after the Scottish Government passed its own post-Brexit legal framework for Scotland, after claiming that the UK’s Government’s EU Withdrawal Bill was a “power grab” on the Scottish Parliament in key areas like agriculture and fishing. Although a political agreement on that now seems unlikely, Ms Sturgeon \u2028will call on the Prime Minister to engage in discussions about how to give Scotland a role in future negotiations following a recent  House of Commons Public Administration \u2028and Constitutional Affairs committee report highlighting the lack of proper engagement with devolved governments.“The UK government has launched a power grab on the Scottish Parliament and now even a House of Commons committee says Whitehall takes little account of the realities of devolution in the UK,” the SNP leader added.“It cannot carry on like this and the UK government needs to start listening to the  views of the people of Scotland.”Westminster has said it must hold on to some powers being repatriated from the EU for a limited period to protect the integrity of the UK market.Read more: Brexit could have a ‘disastrous’ impact on Edinburgh International Festival"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779786.1533638553!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish exam results revealed to thousands of youngsters","story":"        Higher passes for pupils sitting Scottish exams have remained largely in line with last year, official figures show.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nTuesday 7 Aug 2018 4:42 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They will join more than 2,200 other Legion representatives and dignitaries, including Civic and military guests from the UK, Commonwealth and Northern Europe who are taking part.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOnce at the Menin Gate, Fred will lay a wreath on behalf of the Loughbrickland community.\n\nFred Cairns of the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion explained: “Great Pilgrimage 90 is a unique opportunity for the Legion community to come together and bear our Standards along the same route in Ypres taken 90 years earlier by the veterans and widows of the First World War. The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37184302.ece/7cf68/AUTOCROP/w140square/Belfast_Pride-006.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37188107.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Landing%20%202_Lewis.jpg","title":"belfast airport emergency declared on flybe flight plane lands with one engine","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"gerry adams writing cookbook in time for christmas","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"yotel to open glasgow city centre development next year","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Nobody knows where it is, but when you find it, it’s amazing.”\n\nThe campaign has been criticised by the Catholic Church and comes as Pope Francis prepares to visit the country next month. \n\n\nSo apparently, the latest advertising campaign for the city of Vilnius was inspired by German doctor Ernst Gräfenberg, of g-spot fame. (And if you don\u0027t know where Vilnius is, well...) \n\n(via \n@eurotopics\n) \npic.twitter/aTgE5FJsfj\n\n— Katrin Scheib (@kscheib) \nAugust 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said he does not find the campaign, set to be launched on Thursday in London and Berlin, offensive to standards of public decency, but acknowledged its timing was “rather weird”.\n\n“I think it’s a strange advertising choice, but I believe it does not cross the line in a democratic country,” Mr Skvernelis told Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT.\n\nFrancis’ September 22-25 tour of Baltic countries is supposed to start in Lithuania, where Catholics are the religious majority.\n\n“As to the timing, we are speaking about a very important visit to Lithuania,” the prime minister added, referring to the pope’s visit. “So perhaps these steps should have been co-ordinated, but that’s the decision of Vilnius.”\n\nLithuanian priests expressed concerns that the ad used “women’s sexuality for advertising” and gave “wrong ideas” about Vilnius, a city with a population of 540,000. The government earlier originally asked Vilnius officials to postpone the ad’s launch until after the papal visit.\n\nInga Romanovskiene, the manager of the Go Vilnius tourism agency behind the campaign, called the pope’s visit “a very important event.”\n\nVilnius faces “a very high level of competition from other European cities” when it comes to marketing, and those who presented the campaign had “an extremely engaging idea to drive interest in the city”, she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictured us baseball streaker from northern ireland reports","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Since he is an Irish national, he could now be deported. Charges are very serious. All this because I’m told his buddies bet him $80..\n— Hazel Mae (@thehazelmae) \nAugust 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nRan into friends of the streaker outside of Safeco. They showed us his clothes.
