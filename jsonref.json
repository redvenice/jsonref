First ladies attended on their behalf.There was speculation Melania Trump might attend without her husband but that never happened. The Trumps skipped the three ceremonies held during their tenures. The 2020 ceremony was postponed because of the COVID pandemic and was held earlier this year in May.For that hybrid Honors in May - which featured socially distanced performances during a week-long taping - the Bidens welcomed the honorees during a reception at the White House but did not attend any of the performances.The mood on Sunday evening is expected to be festive and collegial, a wave of relief after the controversial Trump years where there was genuine fear the bipartisan event - attended by Democrats and Republicans alike - would become a victim to politics.  Safety measures will be in place due to the coronavirus pandemic. Anyone attended must be vaccinated and must be tested ahead of time. But, in another COVID-related modification, the traditional Saturday night supper - where the honorees receive their medallions on rainbow-colored ribbon - was shifted from the State Department to the Library of Congress. All five honorees attended Saturday\u0027s black-tie event.

Did Prince Harry tell him about his concerns in 2015?‘Just one of the many questions the Metropolitan Police could ask father and son if they choose to investigate.’Harry first met Mr Mahfouz in 2013 at a pub in Chelsea, west London, owned by Mark Dyer, a former royal equerry, The Sunday Times revealed.They discussed the duke’s charity Sentebale, set up in 2006 to help people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by Aids, following his gap year in Africa.The newspaper reported the pair met again at Clarence House the following year after Charles had also met Mr Mahfouz, where Harry allegedly joked: ‘Has father beaten me to it and got the money?’In February 2013, Mr Mahfouz donated £50,000 to Sentebale. Later that year he gave £10,000 to Walking With The Wounded, another charity of which Harry was patron.A spokesman for the duke said: ‘The duke had one planned meeting with this donor eight years ago, did not introduce him to any members of the Royal Family, and expressed his concerns about the donor.’The Prince’s Foundation is being investigated by the Scottish charities regulator over claims it accepted a six-figure sum from a wealthy Russian donor which was later rejected by its ethics committee. An independent investigation into the ‘cash for access’ allegations commissioned by the foundation last week found ‘evidence of communication and co-ordination’ between Mr Fawcett and ‘fixers regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18’.Sentebale said: ‘It is entirely normal and legitimate for patrons to meet potential donors, on whose support we depend. This includes the two donations received in 2013-14 from the Mahfouz Foundation – donations that we would not have accepted if we believed there was anything improper behind them.’  Harry throws his own father under the bus  By Rebecca English To say that the Prince of Wales’ relationship with his sons is complex is an understatement.Both William and Harry have historically accused Charles of being a ‘laissez-faire’ father – one more preoccupied with weighty affairs of state and his considerable philanthropic legacy than bathtime, wrestling matches and bedtime stories.It’s not entirely fair, of course. The reality when it comes to the Royal Family – as with any family – is always more complicated.Like other royals, Charles was ‘deeply, deeply’ hurt at the manner of Harry and Meghan’s bitter exit from the family in 2020.Still, as Harry and William’s relationship descended into acrimony, their father tried to remain a non-partisan figure – partly because Charles has always shied away from personal confrontation with his sons, but also because he genuinely wanted to retain a Swiss-like neutrality between them.But, while disappointing, the statement from the prince’s Los Angeles-based spokesman effectively throwing his father ‘under a bus’ over the ‘cash for honours’ investigation did not come as much of a surprise. The comment, which was belatedly issued after a newspaper highlighted Harry’s own links with Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, was at pains to try to emphasise the younger prince’s own foresight. It glossed over Harry’s private meeting with Mahfouz in a close friend’s pub in Chelsea – and a subsequent encounter at Clarence House where he was said to have joked: ‘Has father beaten me to it and got the money?’Much as there is the notion of collective responsibility at Cabinet level, so is it within the folds of the Royal Family: defend your position directly and to the point by all means, but not at the expense of your nearest and dearest.Harry’s statement, however, was liberally sprinkled with digs at his father – the reference to ‘the CBE scandal’, for example. Then there was the suggestion that the younger prince and his advisers saw sense at the earliest possible opportunity, when Charles’ former senior aide Michael Fawcett – and presumably the Prince of Wales himself – did not.As for the claim that Harry ‘expressed his concerns’ about the donor... well, to whom? Certainly no one within his father’s household has any recollection about this at all.Indeed, I understand that Charles wasn’t even aware until this weekend that his son had met Mahfouz in a west London pub, let alone encouraged his charity to accept any money from him.If Harry was that concerned about the Saudi billionaire, surely he could have warned his father, possibly when he saw him at his London residence the same day.It was also no secret, subsequently, that Mahfouz had become a major donor to Charles’ charitable endeavours – he had a wood named after him at Dumfries House, the Scottish seat of his charitable empire, after all.Contrary to claims in the BBC’s recent controversial documentary on royals and the media that the three royal households are all too quick ‘brief’ against each other, Clarence House was again maintaining a dignified silence last night.But one loyal friend of the Prince of Wales felt obliged to ask: ‘If Harry indeed had such deep concern about this man and his “motives”, then why on earth did he not tell his charity, Sentebale, to just hand the £50,000 he had given them back?’Prince Charles \u0027deeply shocked \u0026amp hurt\u0027 by Harry

that she was \u0027fed up\u0027 with people assuming her weight contributed to her condition. The tribunal previously heard that in February 2019 Professor John Harrison from the force\u0027s Occupational Health department delivered a report on how the illness affected DC Moth\u0027s ability to do her job.He explained that Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that requires people to learn

aid of a fellow officer.However, he added that she was not fit to undergo a fitness test and therefore could not undergo officer safety training. DC Moth said her weight was not a result of her diet but due to the medication she had to take for her chronic condition.DS Marvelly said he did not dispute that but claimed he saw her regularly drink \u0027gallons of Coca Cola\u0027. However, DC Moth

that Dr Plaut had been allowed for years to get away with behaviour which should really not be tolerated.\u0027Others valued her contribution, and accepted that she was not an unpleasant person even when being loudly argumentative in discussion.\u0027Dr Plaut says that any negativity towards her by reason of her interpersonal communication style is unconscious racism as it stems directly from her inherent cultural upbringing.\u0027She finds particularly offensive the suggestion that her loudness is shouting, and finds the application of that word to her to be a great insult.To sum up the great weight of evidence given to us, the vernacular phrase \u0027she is a Marmite person\u0027 is not inaccurate.\u0027The hearing was told that in 2017 the University\u0027s Human Resources department became involved in Dr Plaut\u0027s teaching style and she worked with staff to agree on wording to describe it to students.Dr Plaut took offence to being called \u0027unnaturally loud\u0027 and insisted on being called \u0027naturally loud\u0027.By this point, the tribunal heard that there was friction with the department and \u0027over time HR gradually became less and less tolerant of Dr Plaut\u0027.The panel was told that in January 2019 she was suspended for gross misconduct over a \u0027significantly exaggerated\u0027 claim she shouted at a female student and shone a \u0027laser\u0027 in their eyes.Dr Plaut insisted she had been explaining the scientific concept of saturation and had used a desk light in the student\u0027s face to demonstrate it. However, she apologised for the incident.In a letter giving her a written warning, the university \u0027accepted that Dr Plaut\u0027s loudness was largely unintentional, but expressed concern at her apparent inability to moderate it\u0027.At a return to work meeting in April of that year, the panel heard her relationship with the university\u0027s senior management soured further when she suggested one of her bosses was not open to criticism in his role as head of equality.Bosses \u0027seized\u0027 upon that comment to launch further disciplinary action against her, the tribunal was told, even though the academic concerned did not want it pursued.When, soon after, another of Dr Plaut\u0027s students told the university he wished to change lecturers, bosses falsely told him he could only do so if he complained about her.It resulted in Dr Plaut facing a fresh allegation of \u0027frequently shouting during meetings with a PhD student causing them stress and anxiety\u0027.The tribunal found senior management including Provost Janice Kay wanted to get rid of Dr Plaut.\u0027It is plain that (they) all wanted Dr Plaut dismissed and set that in train\u0027, the report said.The physicist was suspended again and sacked following a disciplinary hearing in December 2019.Finding the university guilty of harassment, victimisation and unfair dismissal, Employment Judge Paul Housego criticised the way an academic of such long standing could have been treated.\u0027This is a very large organisation, of very high reputation, and high professional standards in dealing with the careers of its academics are to be expected,\u0027 he said.\u0027This obligation is the greater when dealing with someone who has spent 30 years working for them. Senior management had decided that Dr Plaut would not be tolerated further.\u0027The good things she had done over the years were given no weight.\u0027The Tribunal does not doubt but for some people Dr Plaut\u0027s approach to life was highly uncomfortable, but that fails to appreciate that this is a façade behind which the evidence is of a long serving dedicated and caring academic.\u0027Judge Housego suggested one way of dealing with Dr Plaut\u0027s perceived shouting was to be given help and an opportunity to change her approach.Dr Plaut - whose additional claims of racial and sex discrimination were dismissed by the panel - will now be awarded compensation at a later date."},{"url":null,"title":"Womens rights campaigners condemn Law Commission","story":"Share this articleIt comes after repeated attacks on Harry Potter author JK Rowling for expressing concerns that women\u0027s rights are being eroded by trans activists.And in October philosopher Professor Kathleen Stock resigned from her academic post at the University of Sussex after being accused of \u0027transphobia\u0027.Dr David Green, chief executive of the Civitas think-tank, said: \u0027The Law Commission\u0027s proposals will do nothing to protect Kathleen Stock or JK Rowling.\u0027The law in a free society should allow people to know whether they will be arrested or not.

The civil disorder claimed 337 lives, the government said in July, with hundreds of shops looted, factories destroyed, warehouses razed, clinics vandalised and ports disabled. The ZEW economic research institute’s economic sentiment index has fallen to 29.9 this month, from 31.7 points in November, showing investors are less upbeat about future prospects. ZEW’s index for current conditions dropped into negative territory for the first time since June, falling to -7.4 from 12.5, as the surge in infections and the lockdown on unvaccinated citizens hits the economy. Today’s jump in industrial production could have lifted spirits, except German factories reported a drop in new orders yesterday....Inflation is pushing up the cost of some Christmas dinner staples, but that isn’t deterring shoppers from filling their baskets with festive fare. Despite the rise in prices, UK grocery sales are staying strong, Kantar reports.  But, the emergence of the Omicron variant could change shopping patterns, says Fraser McKevitt, Kantar’s head of retail and consumer insight: Low wind speeds are forcing energy providers to burn more fossil fuels, points out Bloomberg’s Javier Blas: That’s its highest point in a week, as traders anticipate that Omicron will not have a severe impact on energy demand.  Opec+’s decision last week to keep adding more oil to the market suggests it remains confident about demand, as Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The jump in China’s imports in November has also eased concerns about the global economy, lifting stocks. Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, says: Graham Cox, founder of the Bristol-based Self-Employed Mortgage Hub, suspects house price rises may reverse very soon. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, also warns that the market could start to lose steam. But a rise in borrowing costs, perhaps this month or in February 2022, could cool demand.  Rob Peters, director of Altrincham-based Simple Fast Mortgage says the BoE interest rate decision on December 16th will set the tone for next year.  Northern Ireland, South West England and North West England all recorded double-digit annual growth.  But, Halifax doesn’t expect house prices to keep rising so fast, given the squeeze on households and possible increases in UK interest rates in the coming months. The average house price has now risen by over £20,000 since this time last year, according to Halifax’s data. A shortage of properties, and the ‘race for space’ earlier in the pandemic have helped push up house prices since the first lockdowns lifted, with low mortgage rates also helping. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, explains:  There’s a risk-on mood in the markets today, after China’s exports and imports grew faster than expected in November. The data suggest that external demand surged ahead of the year-end holidays, and that domestic production picked up as China’s power crunch eased --- just as the Evergrande crisis casts a shadow over the slowing property sector. Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets says the strong import growth is “a positive sign on the strength of domestic demand.”  Michelle Lam, greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong, says local stimulus measures also helped. Imports of metal and energy both soared, with coal imports at their highest level this year, natural gas imports the strongest since January, and crude purchases at a three-month high. Back in October, Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, called for “all-out” efforts to keep people warm this winter, in the global scramble for energy.

But he also argued that, in general, Marshall was not taking enough account of the “facts on the ground”. He said: She has also posted a nice Twitter thread on what has changed during her time in parliament here.

Asked on the Today programme if the description of the Foreign Office as dysfunctional and chaotic under his leadrship was unfair and untrue, Raab replied: “What I would say is it’s inaccurate in certain respects.” He also told Sky News that he did not think the problems with the handling of the evactuation from Afghanistan led to his being demoted in the subsequent reshuffle.

The Welsh government said it was aiming in the coming weeks to almost double the rate vaccinations are being administered to more than 200,000 a week. Five million vaccines have so far been administered in Wales. Health boards are again setting up more vaccination centres, including walk-in and drive-through clinics with longer opening hours.

Morgan will hold a press conference on Tuesday with the deputy chief medical officer, Dr Gillian Richardson, about the progress of the booster rollout. This means about 6 million eligible people may still be unvaccinated, based on ONS population figures as opposed to counts of GP records. So who are they? My colleagues Niamh McIntrye and Tobi Thomas have examined the data, which shows disparities in uptake across age, region and ethnicity. Read their report here: As many as 6 million eligible Britons may not have had a Covid jab. Who are they? More than 40 countries have confirmed the presence of Omicron. Our Science Weekly podcast today explores what we know about the new variant. Lucy Campbell will be here shortly to guide you through the rest of the day’s Covid news from the UK and the rest of the world.It was no longer a question of whether the general lockdown would end on Sunday as planned but how, and consultations on that would take place on Wednesday, Nehammer told a news conference.“Until we know more, we need to be careful and so travel restrictions are important to keep the entry in Europe and Germany as low as possible,” Jens Spahn told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of EU health ministers in Brussels. Reuters remind us that late in November, EU states agreed to impose travel restrictions on seven southern African countries after they reported several cases of the Omicron variant, which is considered highly infectious. EU sources said on Monday there was no immediate plan to ease the restrictions, quashing a media report that cited a diplomat saying this could be the case. Ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said: “We are facing a very challenging epidemiological situation in all members states with the Covid-19 pandemic, made especially challenging with the appearance of the Omicron variant.” She said she would urge ministers to step up vaccinations and, when necessary, to promote other non-pharmaceutical measures, such as requiring the wearing of masks and social distancing.I will continue to bring you UK and global Covid lines here.In today’s Science Weekly podcast, to get an update on what we know about the Omicron variant, and how quickly it might be spreading, Madeleine Finlay speaks to Nicola Davis, the ’s science correspondent. It comes after Rennick posted anti-vaccine content on Facebook making similar claims. At a fiery hearing on Tuesday, the head of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, John Skerritt, rejected suggestions it was “nothing much” for children to catch Covid-19 and warned that misinformation was hindering its work.

Why? Because of the success of the vaccine programme.”Then there are those living with the effects of domestic and sexual abuse, which may have worsened due to lockdown, and children and young people whose lives changed immeasurably due to our shift to a state of emergency. I imagine that some women whose birthing experiences were marked by the pandemic will also be experiencing symptoms. Unfortunately, the current system is still not fully equipped to deal with this explosion in trauma cases. The Royal College of Psychiatrists says the NHS is already facing the biggest backlog in its history of those waiting for mental health help. As of September, 1.6 million people were waiting for treatment, and the college says that more funds than those committed to by the government are desperately needed. Read more here: Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett – The explosion of Covid PTSD cases is a mental health crisis in the making The professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London told BBC Breakfast: “The official estimates are about 350-odd Omicron cases, and because the current testing is missing a lot of those, it’s probably at least 1,000 to 2,000 I would guess at the moment. “And we are expecting this to be doubling about every two days at the moment, so if you do your maths – say, assumed it’s 1,000 at the moment, and you think it’s going to be doubling every two days, you can see that those numbers are going to be pretty (high) certainly in about 10 days’ time. By that time, we’ll probably have more cases than they will in some of those African countries. “So I think these travel restrictions do perhaps have their place initially, when cases are really low here and really high in the other country, but when we reach that equilibrium, there’s very little point in having them in my opinion.” PA Media quotes him saying that data from the Zoe symptom study app suggests that about half of all cases at the moment of Delta are being “missed” because they are not presenting with “classic” Covid symptoms of fever, new and persistent cough and a loss or change of smell or taste. “Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild variants we’re seeing in people who have been vaccinated with Delta than anything else,” he said. “And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people won’t recognise as Covid if they just believe the official government advice.” Here’s a reminder of England’s current travel restriction red list. PA Media quotes him telling the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “I think we can now say that this variant is spreading faster in the UK than the Delta variant at the same time, and that’s something that I think was unclear until very recently. I am pretty confident that it’s going to take over probably in a matter of weeks.” Asked about the implications of that, he said: “Well, we don’t know and that’s the really critical question, of course, is how many of those cases of which there will likely be a large number will lead to severe disease? “And a number of people including Dr Fauci have hypothesised that this variant may be more mild or less likely to cause severe disease than previous variants of the virus. “I think what we have seen so far in South Africa, for example, is possibly consistent with that, but it’s really much too soon to say, and the reason for that is that this variant seems to be able to infect iniduals who either have been vaccinated or previously have been infected. “And we know that second infections or breakthrough infections of vaccinated iniduals tend to be more mild. So the fact that so far we have seen not very many severe cases of Omicron, maybe because it is infecting these iniduals with some amount of immunity and that’s good news that they aren’t having tonnes of severe disease, but I think it is too soon to assume that fundamentally Omicron is more mild than say Delta.”The data, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, shows that the companies’ treatment, sotrovimab, is effective against all 37 identified mutations to date in the spike protein, GSK said in a statement."},{"url":null,"title":"is teacher creativity the key to transforming irish education","story":"Teachers have led the charge in ensuring children have settled back into school in a positive manner, prioritising wellbeing and inidual learning needs. Photograph: iStockAs we face into a winter of uncertainty in our schools, Covid-19 continues to plague optimum functioning of our education system. While school leaders continue to battle to keep the physical doors open, increasing cases among children and school communities are a cause of grave concern.The challenge now is to keep school communities as safe as possible, while striving to keep the physical building open in the absence of a continuous and sustainable supply of substitute teachers. It is a case of all hands on deck, qualified or unqualified. For the first time in 20 years teacher recruitment websites are awash with teaching positions with little, if any, response to the call for help.The pandemic has highlighted the criticality of schools and communities working together in partnership to keep schools open and functioning. Since March 2019 we have witnessed schools navigating physical closures and the historic shift to remote learning.Schools and communities are working tirelessly to implement practices in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease among our children. But our children continue to be affected, with many having to remain at home due to illness. The recent cessation of contact tracing in our primary schools has been of particular concern given the potentially deadly repercussions for extended family members who may be especially vulnerable to the virus.School leaders are powerless, working in the dark, uninformed about positive cases while unable to share information with the potential to protect children and their families. Their hands are well and truly tied. And yet schools continue to welcome children into the heart of what they do – teaching, learning and caring.Teachers have led the charge in ensuring children have settled back into school in a positive manner, prioritising wellbeing and inidual learning needs. They continue to support children and their families within our communities. Important rites of passage previously put on hold due to virus restrictions are now being celebrated including graduations, Holy Communions and Confirmations.Teachers and school communities have had to demonstrate agility, creativity and responsiveness within this ever-changing and dynamic context. Teaching is a dynamic undertaking in creativity and innovation embedded within the complex reality of the relational and realised through safe spaces where risk taking, vulnerability and wellbeing are nurtured in a supportive way.The power of teaching as creative endeavour lies in the transformative possibilities for children, teachers, schools, communities and our broader society. The pandemic has demonstrated the possibilities for teachers and school communities to create and innovate, profoundly transforming the education system from the traditional face-to-face classroom to the virtual learning environment.Although much evidence has highlighted the profound inequities which emerged during school closures, it would be detrimental to ignore the creative endeavour undertaken by teachers during the pandemic.While evidence highlights how unprepared teachers felt to engage with virtual learning environments when schools first closed in March 2020, teachers came together to engage in professional development and to share resources through social media in order to innovate and create a new virtual learning environment.The pandemic has offered a window into the power of teacher agency and freedom to create, innovate and transform the Irish education system as never before witnessed.It is crucial we pause to reflect on the level of innovation and creativity undertaken by the teaching profession during the pandemic. It is also extremely important we recognise the critical role teachers, children, special needs assistants (SNAs), school leaders and the wider school community have played in transforming the education system, not only during the period of physical school closures, but also for the future of the Irish education system.Out of necessity, teachers were afforded optimal conditions for creativity and innovation, where they created spaces and opportunities to take risks and be vulnerable navigating the challenges posed by physical school closures and the constrictions to teaching and learning approaches deemed necessary to keep school communities safe.Empowering teachers in this way transformed our education system evidenced by innovative ways to share learning content, to partner and connect with parentss and to re-engage children with learning from home. The legacy of such practices remains to be seen, but early evidence would indicate that learning platforms continue to be used for homework and apps have become the mode of communication between home and school.Morale of teachersHowever, wellbeing and creativity are inextricably linked. Prof Andy Hargreaves argues that “the quality and morale of teachers is absolutely central to the wellbeing of students and their learning”. There is no doubt that teacher wellbeing has been negatively impacted during the pandemic.The pace, intensity and demands of unprecedented changes within the education system continues to undermine the wellbeing of teachers, SNAs and school leaders within our system. We are at a critical juncture with systemic burnout a real possibility. If we fail to nurture teacher wellbeing we fail in ensuring we have a healthy and effective teaching profession. The creative endeavour undertaken by teachers will be stifled to the detriment of continued and meaningful transformation within the system.As we navigate the pandemic and rebuild our society, it is an opportune time to reflect on the purpose and value of education. It is clear that there is a gap between what schools do and how society understands what schools do, particularly in relation to the complex, dynamic and creative work undertaken in our classrooms. As a society, it is imperative to come to a shared understanding in redefining the purpose of the Irish education system. It is also an opportune moment to recognise the power of creativity and innovation within our schools.In order to nurture creativity and innovation we need to ensure teachers are trusted to be agents of change, prioritising their wellbeing to ensure they can meaningfully engage in creative and innovative practices, as witnessed throughout the pandemic. If realised, the transformational possibilities for our system are limitless. If education is the “practice of freedom” (Paulo Freire), schools, teachers and children must be entrusted with the transformational and creative agency required to continue building a dynamic, responsive and inclusive system post-pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 cases up 21 in a week among children aged 14 and under cso says","story":"Confirmed cases of Covid-19 increased significantly among those aged 14 and under in the week to November 26th, according to a report from the Central Statistic Office (CSO). Photograph: iStockConfirmed cases of Covid-19 increased significantly among those aged 14 and under in the week to November 26th, according to a report from the Central Statistic Office (CSO).Cases among the cohort were up 21 per cent when compared to the previous seven days, the CSO’s latest Covid-19 bulletin says, with the age group accounting for more than a quarter (27 per cent or 8,277) of all cases in that period. The bulletin provides information about those contracting or dying from the disease using data sourced from the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).In the latest week 32 per cent of cases were recorded among people aged between 25 and 44. Just 6 per cent of infections were detected among people aged 65 and over while cases in the 80 and over age group decreased by 11 per cent.Twenty nine people died from Covid-19 during the week to November 26th. Of those, 20 (69 per cent) were aged 65 and over. Cork was the only county to record more than five deaths in the week.In total, there were 30,243 cases, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous week. Since October, the weekly data shows the proportion of unvaccinated people catching the virus has declined in percentage terms, reaching 17 per cent by November 19th. The State’s most highly populated counties, Dublin (10,170) and Cork (3,358), had the highest number of new cases although the highest percentage increase in infections was recorded in Co Laois, where there was a 28 per cent rise. The largest decrease (27 per cent) was seen in Co Leitrim. There were 249 hospitalisations in the week ending November 19th and 190 the following week, with a total of 25 people being admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) over the two weeks. Since March of last year exactly half of those treated in ICUs were aged 65 and older. Since the beginning of the pandemic, men have accounted for 52 per cent of hospitalisations and 63 per cent of ICU admissions. The data shows that 16 per cent of reported cases in the week ending November 26th were among those working in wholesale and retail and vehicle repairs sectors. A further 11 per cent were in the industry sector. Although cases are generally increasing across all sectors, cases during the week decreased by 13 per cent amongst those employed in health and social work areas.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins Photos Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has confirmed that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) met on Monday to discuss approving vaccinations for children aged 5-11.Speaking on Claire Byrne Live on RTÉ 1, he said there would be a “significant decision” on vaccinations soon. He added that Niac met on Monday to discuss the priority order of vaccinations, “particularly in relation to children aged 5-11, which we are keen to get started in the new year”.When asked about comments made recently by Dr Cillian De Gascun, a member of Nphet, that he was “hopeful” the schools would reopen in January, Mr Varadkar claimed that school closures have not been discussed by Government. “The Minister for Education is responsible for schools, and what she has said, and certainly what I would support, is the schools are going to open in the new year... there has been no decision, nor discussion, about closing schools in January.”Mr Varadkar said the country was in a “peculiar” situation, clarifying comments that he made at the weekend. “This is the first time since the pandemic began that we are actually tightening restrictions at a time when things are objectively improving.”He said that despite the number of deaths and numbers of people in hospital and ICU declining, the public health advice was that some restrictions are necessary ahead of increased socialisation at Christmas. He said the possibility of a flu season and the emergence of the Omicron variant were also contributing factors to the decision to increase restrictions, as well as the fact that cases are stabilising at a high level, at about 5,000 cases being reported a day. He did not believe the new restrictions would be lifted before January 9th, unless there was a dramatic fall in hospitalisations and ICU admissions.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t.

And I’d like them to do that without taking it away in the next breath.“In no other circumstances where so many people have lost their lives would that happen. They wouldn’t say 72 people sadly died in the Grenfell tower fire, but hundreds of people didn’t. We don’t forget those who were wounded in conflict or those who did not come home.”These are the words of Gareth Eve, husband of Lisa Shaw, the 44 year-old BBC Radio Newcastle presenter who died in May of a rare brain hemorrhage, confirmed by a coroner in August to have been caused by rare complications from the Oxford AstraZeneca jab which scientists believe they discovered the trigger for last week.His is a tough story to hear, but it is made worse by being so hard for him to tell publicly.Gareth and hundreds of others in the UK who have lost loved ones, or seen their lives irrevocably changed by blood clots and other vaccine-related injuries, find themselves in a terrible position as the real stories behind the statistics.Not only are they being forced to battle for the lives, memories or continued care of their partners or children but – although it could not be further from the truth – they know that doing so risks them being branded as anti-vaxxers or even unpatriotic.“Lisa rolled her sleeve up for the country and said, ‘Right, well, I’m going to get my jab, because that’s what we are being told is the right thing to do’,” says Gareth, who had his second vaccination after his wife’s death, and is now bringing up the couple’s six-year-old son Zach alone. “She did it, like all the others, because it would mean that our little bit of the world, our family and community was better protected. And yet nobody even recognises them”.The number of people who have life-changing adverse reactions to vaccines for Covid-19 is a tiny proportion of the many millions of vaccines given, but is mounting in absolute numbers. (the exact percentage is not known)Up to November 17, the MHRA had received Yellow Card reports of 426 cases of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the UK following vaccination with AstraZeneca. The overall case fatality rate was 17 per cent with 73 deaths. There have been, in addition, a small number of other rare adverse reactions which have led to death or disablement – as there are with nearly all pharmaceuticals.Sarah Moore, a partner with the London law firm Hausfeld, represents the families of 95 people impacted by such injuries, including Gareth Eve. Nine have suffered bereavement, while most of the others are caring for close relatives with life-changing injuries. “All have experienced, at first hand, a range of severe adverse health events following Covid-19 vaccination,” she says.When Covid vaccines were first authorised for use in the UK, the Government indemnified the manufacturers and took on liability for any adverse reactions. It then added all of the jabs used – including the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine – to the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme (VDPS).“The UK has one of the most comprehensive immunisation programmes in the world, and sensible routine precautions such as these form a huge part of our global-leading standards in safety,” boasted the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, when announcing the move just ahead of the launch of the Covid vaccination campaign in December 2020.“The VDPS is a safety net to help ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, experienced harm due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine,” added the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at the time.Moore and her clients are not anti-vaccination or suing the government, but campaigning for change: they say the VDPS is not a “safety net” worthy of the name.Launched more than 40 years ago to build confidence in national vaccination programmes, it is now hopelessly out of date – and in danger of doing the exact opposite.Paper-based and under-staffed, it has proven slow, bureaucratic and unresponsive. Claimants must show they are more than “60 per cent” disabled to make a successful claim as well as proving “causation”, which is notoriously difficult to prove. Worse, even for cases that are successful, the maximum total payout is just £120,000.“While £120,000 is a substantial sum of money, it will provide limited security where an inidual has been severely disabled and, particularly, where they may have dependents,” says Moore. “It is significantly lower than the awards that are achieved in personal injury claims involving similarly severe injuries.” Such awards can run to the millions.Historically, the VDPS has received about 100 claims a year, but Covid vaccinations mean that number has dramatically increased.“There are currently c.500 cases (as at November 2021) that require assessment, with this volume currently increasing per week by c.20 cases,” notes a recent government tender document for the running of the service. “It is estimated that in year one of the contract there will be c1500-1800 claims that will require assessment within the first year of the contract,” it adds.Kate Scott, a 32-year-old mum of two boys, age four and one, is one of those claimants. She is struggling to keep the roof over the family’s head after her husband Jamie, 44, suffered a brain injury after receiving the Oxford Astrazeneca jab this spring.Jamie spent 124 days in hospital and was lucky to survive his doctors thought he would need to live in a care home for the rest of his life. But, although he is now home with Kate and their boys, the brain injury he still lives with has changed his life.“We feel like the luckiest unlucky people because, despite all of this, Jamie has made more of a recovery than any of the medical teams thought possible,” she says. “But our life is still dramatically impacted. He’s able to communicate with us and to outsiders, he looks like he’s very much almost back to normal. But for our family that’s not the case.”Jamie can no longer work as a software engineer or even care for his children without supervision, for example.“I solely have to be responsible for the boys as he can’t independently look after them at the moment, which is very difficult for him as well,” says Scott. “He’s amazing. His motivation is truly inspiring, and the doctors have used the term miracle. I feel sometimes when I get upset that I’m being ungrateful. I know that others have lost loved ones.”Kate has had to stop working as a customer service coordinator for a children\u0027s charity to look after Jamie and the children full time. They are struggling financially and Kate worries they may have to sell the family home. She points out the £120,000 maximum payment from the VDPS scheme was worth £500,000 or more when the scheme was launched in 1979.“That’s a lot more money and enough to pay off most people’s mortgages. It would mean Jay could just focus on getting better or one day, he could do a vocational job, perhaps, where there was less pressure on him. It would mean that what has already been traumatic for our children doesn’t get worse. That we don’t have to move house because of it.”In the summer, Kate wrote to Boris Johnson to draw his attention to the holes in the Government’s vaccine safety net. Like others, she pointed out that other developed countries have more generous schemes.“You have suffered a heartbreaking and frightening change but I would like to pay tribute to your strength in proposing changes which you think could improve the situation. You’re not a statistic, and must not be ignored. I am deeply touched by your story.”Johnson went on to say he had asked the DHSC to consider the proposed reforms but, to date, there has been no announcement of change and not a single case has yet been settled via the government scheme. Indeed the DHSC has been directing victims like Gareth and Kate into the benefits system.

After all, there’s Ocado for groceries, a host of scooter warriors for meals and Amazon for everything else. Why should cocaine be any different?Covid, official figures reveal, hasn’t put a dent in the drugs trade hasn’t stopped those lethal entrepreneurs in the Andes from finding a way to supply the US and Europe, their most profitable markets. Above all, it hasn’t stemmed our prodigious demand for Charlie, the Big C, White Lady, Nose Candy, Flake, or the (misnamed, since the vast majority comes from Colombia and Peru) Bolivian marching powder.In the last eight years, a near 20-year decline in drug use has been abruptly reversed. The ONS, which tracks consumption through surveys, is clear what’s behind it: “changes in powder cocaine use”.Today, 2.6 per cent of British adults admit to using cocaine, an increase of more than 30 per cent since 2013. And while the Government, in revealing its 10-year drugs strategy yesterday, said it would target 300,000 perennial abusers with treatment, it offered much tougher words for casual snorters.“We’re not going to sit idly by while we have lifestyle users using Class A drugs,” said Boris Johnson, proposing tough new measures. Plans include removing passports and driving licences to inconvenience middle-class dope dabblers and, the Government hopes, make them reflect on their part in a chain of misery that may end at a Notting Hill shindig, but can begin with brutality in South and Central America, and continue with vicious county lines turf wars back here. “These people think it’s a victimless crime,” said the PM. “It isn’t. The country is ­littered with victims.”That drugs kill, though, is hardly news. And guilt has not limited consumption among the smart set so far. The very same people who rave about Netflix’s brilliant but ultra-violent series Narcos, which documents the rise of Pablo Escobar, are quite happy to keep hoovering up the Toot, even as coke-war eviscerations play out on screen before them.“When I think about the layers of the cocaine trade and the misery it inflicts on people involved, I do feel ashamed, but clearly not enough,” recounts one newish mother, who gathers with five friends “all pushing 40, for monthly ‘cocaine brunches’.”“I compartmentalise,” she says. “That is the raw truth. It’s a holiday from my life – and for now at least, I have no intention of changing that.”Not least as exchanging booze for powder makes toddler-wrangling easier: “Next morning, there’s no hangover, I’m not exhausted from a late night, but I still feel like I’ve had a blowout.” And she’s not alone. “A large number in my social circle – all middle-class, smart, professional women with children – are at it.”  And that cannot be uncoupled from the end of the civil war in Colombia. From the mid-1960s the country’s government was engaged in what amounted, at times, to civil war with Farc communnist guerillas. But by 2013 hostilities had abated, and by 2016, the two sides signed a historic peace deal, under the terms of which many revolutionaries were meant to be found education and jobs. When those didn’t materialise, many turned to farming coca. “Global cocaine manufacture, which had fallen by 37 per cent over the period 2006–2014, more than doubled over the period 2014–2019, to an estimated 1,784 tonnes,” notes the UN in its most recent report on the global drugs market. “The marked increase,” it adds, “has primarily been the result of changes in Colombia.” No one wants to blame a global glut of drugs on a peace deal. But the truth is, Colombia now accounts for almost two-thirds of the world’s estimated manufacture of cocaine.Expanding supply lines have met that increased production. Once, the Calabrian mafia known as the ‘Ndrangheta, which fostered direct contacts with Latin American suppliers, held a European monopoly. But the post-truce collapse of Farc’s own stranglehold in Colombian production areas led to a “proliferation of smaller criminal and armed non-State groups” seeking partners to traffic their product. Albanian gangs, Bosnian Serbs, Croats, Serbs and Montenegrins in particular, stepped in. Cocaine became a hugely competitive market.As so often with competition, the consumer benefited: prices dropped, quality increased. In fact, purity shot up by almost 40 per cent from 2011 to 2018. Britain, long considered the poor cousin of the US, was flooded with coke every bit as refined as that on the other side of the Atlantic. Then the pandemic arrived and dealers ensured that the regulars were kept supplied. Smug snorters had never had it so good.Indeed, it’s not just the pandemic driving drug-dealing ersification. The so-called “dark web” – an underground internet accessed using special browsers – is home to thriving marketplaces which are capturing ever-larger parts of the trade at least £237 million in annual sales in 2017, a four-fold increase in six years. Such direct-to-consumer supplies avoid the hassles of illicit dealers – they are simply posted in the mail.But that still doesn’t answer the question of demand, of why 6 per cent of our increasingly puritanical, drink-less, vegan, 16-24-year-olds have tried it, for example, even as they shun other stimulants, notably alcohol.“I’ve got a 22-year-old and an 18-year-old, and I see it all the time among their friends,” says one mother. “It’s definitely normalised. For them it’s like going to the pub, but cheaper. When we were younger, coke was a yuppie drug, or a hard drug. They view coke very differently. They don’t see it as a Class A drug at all.“They really don’t connect the dots,” between consumption and wider drugs violence, she adds. “But then, most middle class people don’t. I know lots of people who still take it at 50. Sure, they feel bad in the morning, but not as bad as you do with alcohol.” As is backed up by the experience of the “cocaine brunch” set.Across all ages, it seems, cocaine is no longer demonised. Universities will be targeted by the new strategy. Offices may be encouraged to follow. But with coke so widespread, it’s hard to preach without being accused of hypocrisy. One workplace already in the firing line is the Palace of Westminster, whose loos are reportedly plastered with traces of cocaine use, prompting Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to warn that he would be contacting the police “as a priority”. Both the PM and Michael Gove have admitted taking cocaine in their youth.Loewenstein says it is time to admit that half a century of war-on-drugs announcements like yesterday’s are not working, and simply provide political cover for policy failure. “Demand has never been higher, the cost has never been cheaper, access has never been easier. The stats are clear. Drugs are a normal part of many people’s lives.”After he rings off, I try to find more details of the Government’s new plan. As if to prove his point, I am halfway through reading its policy document, setting out its priorities to intervene with young people, treat the most addicted, and stifle gangs supplying drugs. Then I realise I am reading the wrong 10-year plan. This one, near identical in many ways, dates from 1998.  More from NewsBus drivers\u0026#39 brainwaves to be monitored to prevent them falling asleep at the wheelInside Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s \u0026#39house of sin\u0026#39, where sketches of Ghislaine Maxwell and nudes adorn the wallsCoronavirus latest news: UK\u0026#39s omicron Covid cases could surpass red list countries in matter of days, warns expertNearly all children have fallen behind because of Covid, Ofsted warnsPolitics latest news: Afghanistan whistleblower may have misunderstood pressures as he was \u0026#39junior\u0026#39, says Dominic RaabWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inedible food tears 20 minute daily walks around car park","story":"It resembled a scene from Alcatraz inmates circumambulating a tarmac yard, behind a high concrete wall spaced apart to prevent any fraternisation.These were no hardened criminals, however. Their misdeeds consisted of travelling back to the UK from “red list” countries. Rather than prisoners in a high-security prison, they were involuntary guests in a London quarantine hotel, paying thousands of pounds each for the dubious privilege of an 11-night stay.Among those forced to endure the experience were Kate and Alex Freed, a recently married couple who had travelled to South Africa for their honeymoon.But the honeymoon period is well and truly over, and they are now stuck in an awful hotel overlooking Heathrow serving inedible food.Perhaps the most grim condition is that they have to request to be allowed go for a walk outside. A security guard accompanies them downstairs, and they are allowed 20 minutes in the hotel car park before being told they have to go back inside, the pair say.Speaking on the third day of their 10-day quarantine period, Mrs Freed, 29, said: We’d been planning the South Africa trip for ages … we didn’t book it until the green list changed and the foreign travel advice was that it was safe to go to.Her 30-year-old husband added: To be charged for coming back to your country when the Government’s told you it’s safe to go, I think is just wrong.The couple flew back from South Africa on Dec 2, after having their original flight home cancelled due to the travel ban.It was the trip they\u0027d dreamed of, having been forced to rearrange their wedding day four times due to Covid.They said it took almost six hours to get from the plane at Heathrow to their hotel - the Holiday Inn Express at the airport\u0027s Terminal 4 - including waiting in a bus to be taken to their rooms.They put us on to a bus for the 30-second journey, but we were on the bus for three hours, Mr Freed explained.We were on a bus full of people, (with) no ventilation. It was the most unorganised mess ever. People were crying. It just seemed like something from a film, it was a bit mad, he added.After arriving at the hotel itself, the pair said they had food and other supplies delivered by their family, because the hotel food was inedible.You’re paying serious money and … it’s not substantial meals. Half the time it’s cold, half the time it’s just inedible, Mr Freed said.Travellers returning from red list countries originally faced a cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a hotel when the scheme was first announced in February. The price has now risen to £2,285 for the 11-night stay.I’d rather pay for security outside my flat and they can watch me not leave,” Mrs Freed said.I don’t disagree with quarantine if that’s what the Government want to do… It’s just the cost that’s come with it, she added.The way it is run is awful. I just feel something needs to be done about it, Mr Freed said.The Holiday Inn Express declined to comment, but the Department of Health and Social Care spokesman told The : The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme.The majority of passengers who have used the Managed Quarantine Service have been satisfied with the service. All complaints are treated seriously and are investigated fully.Francesca Desquesnes was on holiday in South Africa, preparing for a safari, when the news came through from her sister that she needed to get home now. After trying and failing to book several flights home, she finally arrived at her accommodation for the next 10 days on Dec 2. It\u0027s inhumane. I would I would actually ask any MP to come and spend 10 days in the hotel like this and do what we do and then tell us it\u0027s humane.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Grant Shapps - all three of you.Ms Desquesnes\u0027s will be allowed to leave at one minute past midnight on Dec 15, but has to endure another nine days yet. She told The : I think if you\u0027re not a person that is a strong person, and you weren\u0027t mentally strong, this would destroy you. I honestly believe that this would destroy most people\u0027s sanity.This is not humane or a nice way to treat British citizens. It makes me not want to be British.She - and others in the hotel - have taken their daily exercise into their own hands and started to defy the security protocols. You have to request permission to exercise. You contact security or reception but they don\u0027t answer. Sunday I went out for an hour and it\u0027s like One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest. And then today, I tried doing it, and they didn\u0027t answer. So I just looked out of my room and said I\u0027m going for a walk. And that\u0027s what a lot of people are having to do. We\u0027re just defying them.I think people are wearing masks and we\u0027re following the rules. But if we want to go out for exercise, then people walk.Ms Desquesnes said the food she\u0027s been served is worse than she ate at a HIV project in Africa where she lived with 30 people in a four-bed house. It feels like a prison, she said. It really does. It feels like I\u0027m in Guantanamo Bay. I will never go to prison if this is what it\u0027s like.Michelle Bovey-Wood is trapped at the Holiday Inn Gatwick - the same hotel lambasted by Richard E Grant - with her wife Sharon and their six-year-old daughter Leah. They landed on Dec 2 to find a room that sleeps two people, having paid more than £7,000 for one that sleeps three. Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that the sofa doubled as a bed, even though there was no sheet, pillows or duvet. They had to construct their own bed out of the cushions for their daughter. She told The : Quite honestly, as far as hotel experience goes, I\u0027ve had better in a non-graded hotel in the third world. It\u0027s total abuse. It has abused basically every single human right that we have - freedom of movement - in every sense. People are rude, it\u0027s isolating, there is no support should you need it. It\u0027s horrific.Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that because they had a child, the hotel would accommodate more exercise time - three half-hour slots a day. But they are being allowed out once a day - on Sunday for seven minutes and Monday for 10 minutes. Their exercise space is the hotel\u0027s courtyard - a strip of walkway around a patch of grass. The view is the rooms they are confined to for the other 23 hours and 50 minutes a day. And the hotel tries to send them out alone to avoid mixing with other quarantining families.Mrs Bovey-Wood explained: We were told initially that we could have two to three times a day, as is necessary with a child, and it would be up to half an hour at a time.If you request it, then you wait for about half an hour. If you\u0027re lucky. Somebody will come get you. They usher you down the passage. It was seven minutes. And then there\u0027s a hurry upstairs again. And they said, \u0027No, no, no, it\u0027s going to get better\u0027, the next day we were informed - 10 minutes.And that\u0027s it once a day.  The food served is hot if you\u0027re lucky, and Monday morning\u0027s breakfast consisted of a dry crumpet with a bit of bacon, bread with margarine, three blueberries and a black banana. Lunch is a sandwich, a packet of crisps and a stale chocolate bar. Mrs Bovey-Wood said: You get better care in prisons. I think when we got the bread and margarine this morning, and they inform you of 10 minutes of exercise - which I believe your basic human rights in a prison is at least half an hour\u0027s exercise a day - then you know that there\u0027s a huge problem here.They are given one cold drink a day, but Sharon is a diabetic. Sunday\u0027s drink given to them in the evening was Coke, which Mrs Bovey-Wood explained wasn\u0027t the ideal choice for a six-year-old at night. The mood in the hotel is tense, and the family can hear complaints through the walls. I can hear from our rooms - we can hear everything - there\u0027s a lot of complaining. Of course we have no Wi-Fi either, so we can\u0027t work right now. And smokers aren\u0027t actually allowed to go and use their time for smoking - they have to keep moving.What are they doing to keep sane within the confines of their room? The little one is doing drawing and she\u0027s getting some screen time.The Bovey-Woods are emigrating to the UK from South Africa, and they have not yet been told when they will be free to leave.It has not been the dream start ot their life in the UK. Incredibly rude staff, she said. We got shoved in a room that wasn\u0027t prepared for three people. So you asked for duvets and incredibly rude staff say you have to make up your own beds, that kind of stuff. It\u0027s just grown progressively worse because it\u0027s very clear that they don\u0027t have enough staff to deal with everything.Lauren Hopkins, a recruitment agency boss, says she faces another 11 days stranded in South Africa because there is no quarantine hotel room available until Dec 13 in the UK. She arrived in South Africa on Nov 21 for a 10 day holiday but fears she will not be back in her home until just before Christmas Day.I run a small independent recruitment agency and having worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep it going, I was in desperate need of a break. In reality, this experience has been anything but relaxing and stress free. In all honesty I am ashamed to be British. I, and hundreds of other British citizens have been completely abandoned by our own Government. To say I feel let down is a gross understatement. It\u0027s an utter disgrace.Flights aren\u0027t an issue, it\u0027s getting a hotel quarantine booking that\u0027s keeping us all here. They haven\u0027t put nearly enough on for the amount of us. We\u0027ve been trying since Sunday November 28th to get a booking with no luck. At the moment the 13th December is the earliest availability, meaning we come out Christmas Day and have to fund an extra 11 nights in South Africa. From the communication of the quarantine decision to the lack of any help or cooperation from the Embassy officials to the cancellation of flights homeward, to the severe shortage of quarantine hotels, the acts of our Government have been shocking in their ineptitude.I will never again place faith in politicians or in Departments of State.Richard E Grant has said he was left “confounded” after being stuck in a quarantine hotel charging more than twice as much as a similar alternative nearby.The Withnail and I actor said he had been visiting his 90-year-old mother in southern Africa when he was caught out by the change in travel restrictions.Speaking in a video on Twitter, Grant said: “I went to southern Africa to visit my 90-year-old mother and got caught by the red region Covid restrictions.“It took over a week and many cancelled flights to finally get home, for which I am incredibly grateful.“I understand that there are security costs in the hotel and you’ve got to pay for two Covid tests, but £228 a day to receive 3 meals a day of this very poor standard, in a supposed 4* Holiday Inn hotel, beggars belief.”Grant said his meals, which included a pre-packaged tuna and cucumber sandwich, a sausage casserole and fish and chips, would cost less than £20 to buy elsewhere.A nearby Holiday Inn not being used as a quarantine hotel costs just £89 per night, including breakfast – more than half the cost incurred by red list travellers.More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: UK\u0026#39s omicron Covid cases could surpass red list countries in matter of days, warns expertNearly all children have fallen behind because of Covid, Ofsted warnsPolitics latest news: Afghanistan whistleblower may have misunderstood pressures as he was \u0026#39junior\u0026#39, says Dominic RaabWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?Geminid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesCold Moon 2021: what time it peaks in the UK and full moon dates for next yearMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch kamala harris became incredible disappearing vice president","story":"Kamala Harris made history as the first woman, first Black American and first Asian-American to become vice president. But after less than a year in the post, she is a historically unpopular vice president, according to The \u0027s Washington Editor Rozina Sabur. As seen in the video above, where Ms Harris was once always in the frame during Joe Biden\u0027s major addresses, she\u0027s been notably absent from the president\u0027s side of late. “For now at least, it seems she is no longer Joe Biden\u0027s heir apparent,” says Rozina Sabur.“A number of Democrats seem prepared to challenge her for the nomination should Biden not seek re-election in 2024.”More from NewsBus drivers\u0026#39 brainwaves to be monitored to prevent them falling asleep at the wheelInside Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s \u0026#39house of sin\u0026#39, where sketches of Ghislaine Maxwell and nudes adorn the wallsCoronavirus latest news: UK\u0026#39s omicron Covid cases could surpass red list countries in matter of days, warns expertNearly all children have fallen behind because of Covid, Ofsted warnsPolitics latest news: Afghanistan whistleblower may have misunderstood pressures as he was \u0026#39junior\u0026#39, says Dominic RaabWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"arthur labinjo hughes must pin ghost children have vanished","story":"We must pin down where ghost children who have disappeared from schools are, says Ofsted chief in the wake of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes\u0027s murder. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said it is really important that there is an understanding of where children are in terms of their schooling and education as the country emerges from the pandemic.Asked about so-called ghost children who have never returned to school, she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: It\u0027s a very hard number to pin down. I\u0027ve been talking about the problems of children disappearing from school rolls for some time now.We\u0027ve known about the problems of off-rolling for a couple of years, we\u0027ve been working on that. We know how hard it became during the pandemic to work out who was still in the country, who was still taking part in school at all.There\u0027s a real need now to pin down where children are. I\u0027ve been pushing for a register of home-educated children for a long time. The plans for that were put on hold due to the pandemic.It\u0027s really, really important that we understand who the children in this country are, where they\u0027re being educated, who\u0027s taking responsibility for that. We need a real effort coming out of the pandemic to make sure that we\u0027ve got that buttoned down.Ms Spielman said they will be starting work on their investigation into services involved with child protection in Solihull, where Arthur died, next week.She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: What\u0027s important is getting the right focus on how people are working.Alongside the investigation into the particular circumstances of poor Arthur\u0027s death, we\u0027ve been asked to lead a joint targeted area inspection, looking at all of the services that are involved with child protection in Solihull.So that\u0027s not just care and education, but also health, police, probation. It\u0027s not an investigation of the case itself, which is a separate piece of work, but we\u0027ll be looking at how those services jointly are dealing with child protection at the moment and what improvements can be made.Warnings about Arthur Labinjo-Hughes were ignored, his grandfather has said.Arthur\u0027s stepmother Emma Tustin, 32, was jailed for life at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, with a minimum term of 29 years, after being found guilty of the six-year-old\u0027s murder.His father, Thomas Hughes, 29, was sentenced to 21 years for manslaughter.Peter Halcrow, Arthur\u0027s maternal grandfather, said warnings were issued by the little boy\u0027s other grandparents.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: They\u0027re decent people and they were very concerned. And they issued warnings that were ignored, shall we say.As for the couple responsible for his death, Mr Halcrow said they had committed a heinous crime by killing a defenceless, innocent boy.Mr Halcrow told the broadcaster: I wouldn\u0027t give them the time of day and I wouldn\u0027t want them to see the light of day ever again.Arthur was left with an unsurvivable brain injury while in the sole care of evil Tustin.She was convicted of murder by assaulting defenceless Arthur in the hallway of her Cranmore Road home in Solihull, on June 16 2020.Arthur, whose body was covered in 130 bruises, died in hospital the next day.Mr Halcrow said he can\u0027t understand why warnings about the six-year-old\u0027s care were not heeded.He said the little boy had been well loved and well looked after by his paternal grandparents.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: They\u0027re decent people, and they were very concerned, and they issued warnings which were ignored, shall we say.He added: I can\u0027t understand why something wasn\u0027t done about it.I don\u0027t know who runs Solihull social services or who went round to the house, because they were called and they must have had a snapshot of the house, and they must have felt everything was fine.There\u0027s been phone calls made to West Midlands Police as well, which were not acted on. It\u0027s a tough one, when you hear the kind of abuse the boy was going through.Mr Halcrow said someone should have stepped in when alarm bells were ringing in the case of his grandson Arthur Labinjo-Hughes.Asked what he would like reviews into the six-year-old\u0027s death to consider, Mr Halcrow told Today: It\u0027s not as if it was a kind of \u0027passing by\u0027 thing. I mean, people were flagging up there were problems and social services got involved and said there was nothing to worry about, and then \u0027hey ho\u0027, three or four months later, the boy is dead.How can you ask me what I would like them to consider? I mean, they must have a tick-list to do, \u0027house is clean, everything\u0027s tidy, blah, blah, blah, so we\u0027ll not worry about it\u0027.If alarm bells are ringing all around, even neighbour statements, then surely, there must be someone or some kind of body that can step in and say \u0027right, we\u0027re taking that child out of that situation\u0027, you know?If the father is not man enough to do that himself then someone has to say \u0027this child is suffering and needs help\u0027 and take them out of the situation.

Inevitably, that will cause some impact on motor transport.“It’s about available road space, as well as effective use of that road space, and good information for users so they can plan about when they travel.”Mr Lees added that the trend was mostly driven by the UK’s strong post-pandemic recovery, adding: “If you’re sat in that congestion, then it’s probably not a good thing.“But actually, for the country, it’s not really reflecting a bad thing, because what this is showing is that the UK, and particularly London, has rebounded most quickly from the effects of the pandemic.”Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at the charity Cycling UK, said: “It’s incredibly simplistic for Inrix to suggest that the use of road is all about supply and demand, without considering how efficiently that road space is used.“On Blackfriars Bridge, cycle lanes take up 20 per cent of the road space but move 70 per cent of the people across it at peak times, with cycle lanes across London moving more people more efficiently in less space.“Inrix are focussed on the tarmac available for cars, when the question should be how we use and allocate that space better, changing travel behaviours and reducing congestion in the process.”Last year the traffic information supplier ranked London as only the 16th most congested city. New cycle lanes were installed in the capital in 2020 following the coronavirus outbreak, in a bid to encourage active travel.Several councils reversed the schemes following vocal opposition by motorists who claimed they caused delays, but some of the lanes remain in place.Paris was in second place in the global ranking for most congestion, followed by Brussels, Moscow and New York.Across the UK as a whole, drivers will waste an average of 73 hours in traffic this year, up 36 hours from 2020, but down 42 hours compared with pre-Covid 2019.Inrix estimated that the economic hit from drivers being stuck in traffic this year will cost an average of £595 per person, and the UK £8 billion.Trips to larger city centres still lag behind normal levels, but smaller cities are experiencing “minimal decreases in travel” which is maintaining congestion levels, according to the company.This has led to Cambridge becoming the UK’s second most congested city, followed by Bristol, Exeter and Cheltenham.More from NewsBus drivers\u0026#39 brainwaves to be monitored to prevent them falling asleep at the wheelInside Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s \u0026#39house of sin\u0026#39, where sketches of Ghislaine Maxwell and nudes adorn the wallsCoronavirus latest news: UK\u0026#39s omicron Covid cases could surpass red list countries in matter of days, warns expertNearly all children have fallen behind because of Covid, Ofsted warnsPolitics latest news: Afghanistan whistleblower may have misunderstood pressures as he was \u0026#39junior\u0026#39, says Dominic RaabWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david tennant around world 80 days shows alarming side british","story":"A new BBC One adaptation of Around the World in 80 Days will highlight the “alarming” nature of the British Empire, according to its star.David Tennant said the eight-part drama, which begins on Boxing Day and is aimed at a family audience, will explore “the racial and sexual politics” of Victorian England.He plays Phileas Fogg in the updated version of Jules Vernes’ novel. Ibrahim Koma, a French actor of Malian heritage, plays Passepartout, while the original character of Detective Fix has been replaced by Abigail Fix, an intrepid journalist.Speaking to Radio Times, Tennant said his Fogg was a “damaged” character.“In many ways, Phileas Fogg represents everything that’s alarming and peculiar about that old sense of British Empire. Potentially, it’s a story about an England that should elicit very little sympathy,” he said.“Verne chose to make Phileas Fogg a particularly stuffy Englishman. We’re showing a different type of stuffy Englishman. He’s very damaged, everything is a trauma for him.”The BBC has described the drama as “an ambitious interpretation of this classic novel for a new generation”. Other actors to have played Fogg include David Niven in 1956 and Pierce Brosnan in 1989.In a separate interview at this year\u0027s Cannes Film Festival, Tennant said the 1873 novel was “of its time” and the television series would approach things from a 21st-century perspective.“It seems almost an obvious thing to do to make one of our main characters female it seems rather regressive not to,” he said.“The sexual politics of the time are investigated, and it is also brilliant that Ibrahim, who plays Passepartout, is a black man. That’s also something that I think is right and proper about having a erse cast.“This is an unusual cast of characters travelling the world, but we use it to look at the racial and sexual politics of the time.“I think that is the right way to tell that story in the 21st century - not to pretend that the world was some sort of wonderful melting pot back in the 1870s.”In his Radio Times interview, Tennant questioned the Government’s desire to have “distinctively British” television shows, asking if what they actually desire was “programmes that have a certain political viewpoint”.“Is it just a government pleading for the artist to be more sympathetic towards it? Why would the government feel they need more sympathy directed towards them? Perhaps that’s a question they should ask themselves, rather than trying to blame it on the television industry,” he said.More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: UK\u0026#39s omicron Covid cases could surpass red list countries in matter of days, warns expertNearly all children have fallen behind because of Covid, Ofsted warnsPolitics latest news: Afghanistan whistleblower may have misunderstood pressures as he was \u0026#39junior\u0026#39, says Dominic RaabWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?Geminid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesCold Moon 2021: what time it peaks in the UK and full moon dates for next yearMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one secretly intercepted cable could have prevented pearl harbour","story":"It was 07.48am on a Sunday morning when Guy C. Avery, an engineer for the US Navy, first heard the sound of a plane with a curiously foreign-sounding engine. He was asleep in a bunk bed at the time, inside his bungalow, which he shared with his naval comrades. It was a comfortably warm morning in Honolulu, Hawaii, with a gentle breeze. Out of a mostly cloudless sky roared 350 Japanese planes, each branded with the flag of the red sun. At first, Avery assumed he was hearing the US Air Force conducting a training exercise. But after clambering out of bed to look through his window, he spotted a “Zero” – American slang for a Japanese fighter jet – firing from a machine gun down at people below. “It’s war,” he shouted across his still half-asleep dormitory.It was 7th December 1941 – famously described by President Roosevelt as a “date which will live infamy” – and America was seriously unprepared for an air attack on its Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, as the above eyewitness testimony, published in Sunday in Hell by Bill McWilliams, demonstrates. Minutes after the firing of the first torpedo, US naval officers tried to scramble fighter jets, but with dozens of bombs already falling from the sky, it was too late to make much difference. Aboard the USS Arizona battleship, a sailor recalled stepping out onto the quarterdeck into a reddish blur of flames, and seeing men “like zombies, burned completely white. Their hair was burned off their eyebrows were burned off… the insoles of their shoes was about the only thing left on their bodies.”Those events are etched into the Western consciousness. Bigger battles have happened since, with larger explosions and more gruesome death tolls. But none seem to captivate the public quite like the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, which came with no warning or formal declaration of war. Some 2,403 Americans were killed, most of whom were in their late teens and early 20s as well as 64 Japanese airmen and submariners.But the attack shouldn’t have come as such a shock. Today, on the 80th anniversary, historians say the whole affair might never have happened were it not for a handful of avoidable intelligence blunders in Washington.It’s difficult to overstate the significance of that Sunday morning in Hawaii, says Takuma Melber, historian at Germany’s Heidelberg University, and author of Pearl Harbor, a book about the atrocity released in October. It was a “decisive moment in world history”, bringing together the European and Asian theatres of the Second World War. It ended America’s two decade-long experiment in isolation, and marked the beginning of its role as an active, global superpower a mantle it still carries. Before December 1941, there was serious debate in America about whether they should join the war. A vocal minority even argued that America should join the war on the side of Hitler. Pearl Harbor put a stop to that, forcing the US Congress to declare immediate war on Japan (and, the next day, on Hitler’s Germany). Pearl Harbor was also the first time aircraft carriers were used to launch a major assault – significant, because it showed how to launch an air attack from across an ocean, thousands of miles away.But in the last few years, a number of well-researched books have shown just how easily Pearl Harbor could have been radically different. On the American side, a series of intelligence blunders left authorities blind. Key figures in Washington undervalued Japanese strength, partly due to racist ideas about Asians, and failed to heed warnings about threats to their Pacific battleships, writes Melber. In particular, US top brass failed to take seriously the threat of fighter jets armed with torpedoes - a relatively new and game-changing technology. Britain, too, was complacent a few days before the attack, Winston Churchill predicted a Japanese attack while speaking to his foreign secretary, Anthony Eden – but said it would not come until after spring 1942.For years before 1941, a code-breaking team in Washington was secretly intercepting about 90 per cent of Japan’s telegrams. If read correctly, they could have contained ample warning that Japan was about to strike. In July 1941, they learned that the Japanese navy was moving in the Ariake Sea, simulating air attacks on large ships. A few months later, in November, they intercepted a telegram from Tokyo, ordering the Japanese consulate in Hawaii to report twice a week on the position of US ships in Pearl Harbor. And in December, just a few days before attacks, the Japanese government ordered its embassies in London, Hong Kong, and Washington to destroy their codebooks and encrypting machines – a suspicious order, implying imminent war.But the 10-member team was understaffed, and under extreme pressure. The leader, Alvin D. Kramer, regularly worked 16-hour days, but it still wasn’t enough. Desks became overwhelmed by piles of unread documents. There simply weren’t enough Japanese-speakers to translate them in time. Some documents were successfully translated, but other agencies of the overstretched US government failed to heed their warning. As Melber writes: “With hindsight, it is conceivable that the Americans could have anticipated the attack on Pearl Harbor on the basis of the intercepted and decoded Japanese telegrams.”And even when crucial information did come through, the bureaucratic labyrinthe of the US government made communication difficult, leaving key decision-makers in the dark, as historian Steve Twomey writes in his 2016 book, Countdown to Pearl Harbor. Ten days before the attack, Navy top brass issued a dramatic cable, warning of “imminent war” and ordering a “defensive deployment”. But the message was frustratingly vague, with no mention of Hawaii or the Pacific. The commander of Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, did not consider a Japanese raid on his fleet to be likely, and so assumed the warning didn\u0027t apply to him. His ships couldn’t sail all the way across the Pacific to launch a surprise assault, so he thought his adversaries in Tokyo couldn’t do it either. He took no precautions. He ordered no  reconnaissance flights, no steel nets to be strung around the anchored ships, and gave little thought to anti-aircraft guns.Pearl Harbor was left a vulnerable bullseye, a “barrel crammed with fish, tied up... without room to maneuver and only one way out, a narrow channel that was susceptible to blockage”, writes Twomey. He wonders whether a more clearly worded message from Washington might have caught the commander’s attention. “How that might have changed everything,” Twomey writes.Incompetencies appear so glaring that a small number of Americans have long suspected a sinister plot. Some have suggested that President Roosevelt was fully aware of an impending attack, but allowed it to go ahead so he would have a pretext to take America into war on the Allied side - a claim advanced most forcefully by journalist and author Robert Stinnett, in his 1982 book, At Dawn We Slept. Others have claimed, controversially, that Churchill was given advance knowledge of the assault from sources across the British Empire, but stayed quiet so Britain would have an ally against Nazi Germany.But serious historians have generally given short shrift to these ideas. Melber says claims of an American or British conspiracy “lack credible evidence”. Conspiracism is a long-running feature of American politics, famously described by essayist Richard Hofstadter as the “paranoid style” it’s not surprising that such a shocking atrocity would evoke far-fetched claims. Rather than a sinister cover-up, it’s more likely that America’s pre-war military infrastructure was simply not cut-out for the level of intelligence-gathering needed to prevent such an attack.Others say military leaders have been unfairly tarnished. Intelligence is never perfect. Officers have to sift through vast quantities of largely irrelevant information - only in retrospect is it easy to identify what is truly important. “It’s always easy to criticise intelligence, and frankly I think all that is a great hue and cry about nothing,” says McWilliams.“Those kinds of criticisms are always rife, particularly when disaster strikes. Post World War Two, our armed services were reorganised, which hopefully will keep us focused on what we need to do in the future.”More from NewsInside Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s \u0026#39house of sin\u0026#39, where sketches of Ghislaine Maxwell and nudes adorn the wallsCoronavirus latest news: UK\u0026#39s omicron Covid cases could surpass red list countries in matter of days, warns expertNearly all children have fallen behind because of Covid, Ofsted warnsPolitics latest news: Afghanistan whistleblower may have misunderstood pressures as he was \u0026#39junior\u0026#39, says Dominic RaabWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?Geminid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron refuses say hed","story":"Exclusive: David Cameron refuses to sayhed attend Grenfell inquiry after ridiculing rulesEXCLUSIVE: Returning red-faced from a morning spot of tennis at a local club, Mr Cameron repeatedly said “morning” to the Mirror but would not answer our questions on the inquiryFormer PM David Cameron leaves his Notting Hill home Image: TIM ANDERSONByMatthew Young:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsDavid Cameron this morning refused to say whether he would attend the Grenfell Tower inquirycalled upon. It came after Michael Mansfield QC, a lawyer for the bereaved and survivors of the tragedy, yesterday said the former Tory PM should be called to answer questions at the probe into the June  fire, which killed  people. Mr Cameron said in  how he wanted to “scrap health and safety rules that put people off”, the inquiry heard on Monday. The following year he disparaged the “shadow” of health and safety, saying: “Britannia didn’t rule the waves with armbands on.” Mr Mansfield said Cameron ridiculed health and safety rules “relegating citizens…to effectively a bonfire”. Mr Cameron was being referred to by lawyers as they described more than  years of cover ups of the extent of the cladding crisis that led to the blaze. But the former PM, , refused to say this morning whether he would attend the inquirycalled upon. Returning red-faced from a morning spot of tennis at a local club, Mr Cameron repeatedly said “morning” to the Mirror but would not answer our questions on the inquiry or whether he would attend. He entered his plush Notting Hill home - which lies just one mile from Grenfell Tower - and slammed the door shut. In response to the claims made in the inquiry Mr Cameron’s spokesman said he was for “a sensible approach to health and safety [rules] to ensure they protected people and were applied where needed rather than unnecessarily overwhelm businesses with red tape”.Do you think David Cameron should face the inquiry  Join the debate in the comments below The previously inquiry heard how the government acknowledged that a rule against introducing new regulations for the building industry in the s put it in breach of its duty to protect the right to le. The hearing heard the government suppressed information about the combustibility of cladding used on Lakanal House after a fire killed six people in  in Camberwell, south east London. It noted the need to “avoid giving the impression that we believe all buildings of this constructioninherently unsafe”. The investigation into this fire was shut down by officials in a “grotesque abdication of responsibility” which “raises the spectre of a deliberate cover up”, the inqury was told.  After Lakanal, despite the government outwardly promising to implement the coroner’s recommendation to encourage the use of sprinklers, civil servants wrote that it was simply acting “to be able to say that DCLG is taking action”. A senior civil servant warned in May  – just a month before the Grenfell Tower fire – that “we or ministers are increasingly vulnerable to some or all of these risks becoming material andbeing held to account for being inactive”.

And revellers at an unofficial No Christmas bash on December  allegedly enjoyed food, drinks and games which went on well past midnight.

And they added: “The Prime Minister said the UK would continue to use all the economic and diplomatic tools at its disposal to prevent any Russian aggression against Ukraine.  “The leaders agreed to speak again following President Biden’s conversation with President Putin tomorrow.” The US and Russian leaders are due to speak in a video call on Tuesday amid rising tensions over a Russian troop build-up on the Ukrainian border – seen as a sign of a potential invasion. US intelligence officials have said Russia could be planning for a possible invasion as soon as early next year, while Ukrainian officials have said it could be next month. A senior Biden administration official said on Monday that Mr Biden will directly address the concerns with Mr Putin. He added the president had agreed with European counterparts that there was the option to impose “substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the United States that would impose signicant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed” with an invasion.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed plans on Saturday for the much-anticipated call and said it will take place in the evening. Russia is adamant the US should guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to the Nato military alliance. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said the number of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Russia-annexed Crimea is estimated at ,, and warned that a “large-scale escalation” is possible in January. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, recently charged that a group of Russians and Ukrainians planned to attempt a coup in his country and the plotters tried to enlist the help of Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov. Russia has denied that any plot is under way, but the Russians have become more explicit recently in their warnings to Ukraine and the United States. The Kremlin said on Friday that Mr Putin, during his call with Mr Biden, would seek binding guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine. Mr Biden tried to head off the demand in comments to reporters on Friday before leaving for a weekend stay at Camp David.

Arthuraposs stepmother Emma Tustin, , was jailed for le at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, with a minimum term of  years, after being found guilty of the six-year-oldaposs murder. His father, Thomas Hughes, , was sentenced to  years for manslaughter. Peter Halcrow, Arthuraposs maternal grandfather, said warnings were issued by the little boyaposs other grandparents as well as social services. He said the little boy had been well loved and well looked after by his paternal grandparents.Mr Halcrow told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Theyaposre decent people and they were very concerned. And they issued warnings that were ignored, shall we say. He added: Theymust have a tick list to do, aposhouse is clean, things are tidy, so weaposll not worry about itapos. If alarm bells are ringing all around, even neighbouraposs statements, surely there must be someone or some kind of body that can step in and stay right weaposre taking that child out of that situation. If the father is not man enough himself to do that himself, then someone has to say this child is suffering and needs help and takes them out of the situation. He added: I canapost understand why something wasnapost done about it. I donapost know who runs Solihull social services or who went round to the house, because they were called and they must have had a snapshot of the house, and they must have felt everything was fine.  Thereaposs been phone calls made to West Midlands Police as well, which were not acted on. Itaposs a tough one, when you hear the kind of abuse the boy was going through. When asked about Arthuraposs relationship with his mum Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow, who was jailed for killing her boyfriend Gary Cunningham, Mr Halcrow said they were bonded. The pair of them, Arthur and her, were so happy, he said. She was a great mother. She spoiled them rotten as motheraposs do. The grandad added: There was a whole le ahead of him. As for the couple responsible for his death, Mr Halcrow said they had committed a heinous crime by killing a defenceless, innocent boy. He told the broadcaster: I wouldnapost give them the time of day and I wouldnapost want them to see the light of day ever again.  Arthur was left with an un-survivable brain injury while in the sole care of evil Tustin. She was convicted of murder by assaulting defenceless Arthur in the hallway of her Cranmore Road home in Solihull, on June  . Arthur, whose body was covered in  bruises, died in hospital the next day. This weekend Mr Halcrow said he was “shocked and mystied” as to how social workers had missed signs that Arthur was being abused.He told The Sun: “They must never see the light of day again. No punishment could ever be enough for this pair.I have never favoured the death penalty because I know mistakes can be made by courts, but in my view they have forfeited their right to live.  “They should certainly never leave prison as long as they live for such cruelty and inhumanity.” Mr Halcrow, from Dunkeld, Perthshire, said that he felt physically sick while following the court case online, and added that he hadnapost realise how much his grandson had suffered until the case. I don’t think I’ll ever get over this.” On Sunday, the community gathered in Arthuraposs home town of Solihull, West Midlands, for a balloon release in his memory. Arthur’s gran Madeleine Halcrow wept as hundreds of balloons were released into the air. Meanwhile, Ofsted will hold a separate inspection focusing on the safeguarding agencies in Solihull. Arthuraposs body currently remains in a mortuary because both families are allegedly not agreeing on who is organising the funeral.

The father-of-two has now said he feels like a rug has been “pulled out” from under him after his PCR kit was lost. He is now hoping for compensation from the retailer, as well as for things to line up for him to get into Thailand before Christmas.The father-of-two has shared his disappointment withBristol Liveand said he will never use Bootsapos services ever again.The retailer has since apologised for the mishap and offered to pay for a “full refund for the price of his test”, but Nick believes he is entitled to more. On November , the -year-old visited the health retailer and pharmacyaposs Broadmead branch to take a PCR test, requiring a negative result to enable him to fly, and was told to wait up to  hours for a result.  Even when the deadline had passed two days after his test, he was convinced he would receive an email from the laboratory as Boots is a huge household name. But on the morning of his planned flight at :am on December , he still hadnapost heard back about his test, despite having attempted to find out multiple times. Unsure what to do, Nick went to the airport regardless, but his efforts were in vain. I had no choice as I had to go to the airport either way and my flight was leaving at that point,” he said. There was no way I could have got my PCR test but I thought the only way was to ring them up and seethey had my results ready. Nick added that only when there was  minutes left before check-in closed was he informed by a staff member at Boots that his test was lost in transit. Despite pleading with Boots that he hadn’t seen his children for almost two years and wanted to be with his family over the Christmas holidays, the company told him the best they could do was offer a full refund of £, the cost of the test kit. Nick said: I was absolutely fuming - I tried to ring up to look for a complaints department to speak to someone who could help and give me a bit of empathy about the situation When I had spoken to a member of staff, they said to me that they would pass on my message and get someone to call back. “Usually they said it takes them  hours for a response but also that it might take longerthey’re busy. That’s when I decided to not ring them anymore because it was a waste of time. Nick is now hoping to rebook his flight to reunite with his family, who he hasn’t seen since January last year, but fears it could be dficult. Before you travel to Thailand, you need to have a Thai pass so you can enter the country and you must have a lot of things put in place before you can get the pass such as booking for a hotel,” he said. So the knock-on effect of what Boots did is huge and I definitely feel after all the losses my family and I had suffered from, there is definitely compensation that I’m entitled to. This trip was about spending time with my family but I had to tell them over the phone that I’m not going to be there. They were so upset and so angry at Boots. They made me make my kids cry. Nick is now hoping compensation from the retailer. “I thought Boots was meant to be this big name who would never do anything like this and that’s why I went to them, but they were awful, he said. That’s why I’m doubling my efforts to fix things because they don’t seem to care every time I’ve spoken to them. Boots has since apologised for causing such distress. A spokesperson for the retailer said: At Boots we offer a range of Fit to Fly COVID- tests and the vast majority of them are processed normally within our recommended time frames. Unfortunately, in the case of Nicholas Baggs, his test went missing in transit to the laboratory – a very rare occurrence. We offer our wholehearted apology to Mr Baggs for the disruption this has caused to his travel plans and have offered a full refund for the price of his test.

But, with less than three weeks until families across the country get together for Christmas Day, experts have warned that time is running out for people to be protected on the day. The UKaposs Health Security Agencyhave said that Brits have just four days to get the extra jab. To ensure maximum protection, especially for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, they have given the deadline December  to get the booster.  This date ensures that enough time has passed for the jab to reach full affect before families mingle to enjoy the festivities.The booster jab is available on the NHS for people who are aged  and over, have certain health conditions, live or work in a care home, are pregnant or work in health and social care.In England, more than  million people are eligible for a free flu vaccine this winter. Eligible iniduals can get their flu booster at their GP surgery, at a pharmacy that offers the service, or a midwery service for those who are pregnant. The UKHSA emphasises the need for people to get the jab over winter as typically levels ramp up over the colder months. While many people aged  and over have already come forward for their flu vaccination, exceeding the WHO target of %, less than half of those with underlying health conditions have taken up the offer. The amount of pregnant women opting for the jab is also lower than other groups, with just .% vaccinated so far this season.  Flu can have particularly severe implications for those living with a long-term health condition, including respiratory and heart conditions, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease or a chronic neurological disease. The flu is highly infectious and according to UKHSA, those with health issues are  times more likely to diethey catch flu compared to healthy adults. In the UK, eligible ethnic minority groups are particularly less likely to have had the flu jab, with those from a Black Caribbean and Black African heritage making up the lowest uptake. UKHSA is urging people from these groups to come forward and book their flu jabs as soon as possible. The NHS website states that most adults can have the flu vaccine, those who have had allergic reactions to vaccines in the past should avoid it. Those who have egg allergies are particularly cautioned as some flu vaccines contain eggs, and anyone with this allergy wishing to have a jab should consult with a doctor or pharmacist first.

Harry and Meghan left the UK last year after a growing rt with other members of the Royal Family and they have been critical of The Firm in a bombshell chat with Oprah and other interviews. Now it is claimed Harryaposs recent comments have left Charles deeply shocked and hurt, and the Prince of Wales is keeping a dignied silence amid fears a public spat could damage his reign. It is alleged the father and son have had only a few fraught conversations on the phone since Harry and Meghan quit their roles as senior royals and moved to Los Angeles in .  It was reported at the weekend that Harry met with Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz in  after the Saudi tycoon gave £, to the princeaposs charity and hinted he would give millions more. Mahfouz later donated £.million to Charles’ Prince’s Foundation and received an honorary CBE months later. The Charity Commission has launched an investigation. Mr Mahfouz denies that has done anything wrong. Clarence House has previously said Charles had “no knowledge” of the alleged cash for honours scandal. Following the Timesapos report, Harry denied involvement in cash for honours claims and said he “severed ties” with the Saudi billionaire six years ago. In , Harry “expressed his concerns” about Mahfouz, a spokesperson has claimed.A friend of the Prince of Wales told the Sun: “Charles is deeply shocked and disappointed by Harry’s latest statement which effectively threw his father under the bus.“There are fears that this episode with Mahfouz could even be a chapter in Harry’s autobiography. This attack was more damaging than the swipe at Charles’s parenting skills because this was a challenge to the way he conducts his business which is far more damaging to the future king.  The friend added: “These constant barbs about his father from America could be very damaging to his reign. Attempts have been made to clear the air but they have barely spoken since the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral. Harry claimed in an interview with the actor Dax Shepard that he needed to leave the UK and “break the cycle” by bringing up his family in a dferent environment. He also claimed to Oprah in an interview last March that he had since been cut off financially. He received £ million from Charles in the   financial year.

From Covid tests to isolating, heres what you need to know before your holidayChanges to travel rules will soon be in place in a bid to stop the spread of the Omicron iant Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec | comments New changes to UK travel rules are coming into effect due to concerns over the coronavirus. Concerns have been raised over the new Omicron iant, which is beginning to sp rapidly among people in the UK. It has not yet been confirmedthe virus is more easily transmitted,symptoms are more severe orit is more resistant to vaccines, but prime minister Boris Johnson and health secretary Sajid Javid deemed the risk to be unacceptable based on scientic advice that mass transmissions could overwhelm the NHS.It caused the government to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport as well as other outlets and now travel rule changes are being put in place too. So what are the new rules  Do I need a PCR test to travel   You need to take a PCR test or a lateral flow test when travelling back to the UK and then a PCR test upon arrival.These tests need to be purchased from a government-approved retailer, which you can find on the government website. They will make your holiday pricier, and you will need to isolate at home for two days, or until your PCR test results come back as negative. If you have a positive test, the NHS website states you must self-isolate: The self-isolation period includes the day your symptoms startedand the next  full days.The rules come into effect at am on Tuesday, December , and require that everyone over the age of  take a pre-departure test a maximum of  hours before leaving. Each country has its own set of rules for travel and you should not make the mistake of assuming the UKaposs rules apply abroad.  You should check the requirements for the country youaposre travelling to before booking this test, which you can check on the government website here. France, for example, requires people to show proof of a negative Covid- test resultbefore departure. This applies to all travellers whether they are fully vaccinated or not. How long does a PCR test take to come back   PCR tests are required upon arrival into the UK and you must isolate until receiving a negative result. According to the NHS: Most people get their result the next day, but it may take up to three days. If you do not receive any word of your result by day six, you should call , where lines are open from am until pm.  It is unlikely that a PCR test will take this long to come back, however. You will usually receive word of your test result through either a text message or via email. Some people can also view their test result through the NHS COVID- app. How much do PCR tests cost  The price of a PCR test ies by a large amount. Some, according to the government website, can be bought for as little as £, while others may set you back by as much as £.Some airlines offer discounts on tests and the government PCR tests do not have this option, so check before booking one provided by the authorities.  Travel companies are worried that passengers will be put off by the extra costs of travelling to a particular country. The industry was hit particularly hard by the pandemic.British Airways CEO Sean Doyle said to the BBC : Our customers will now be faced with uncertainty and chaos and yet again this a devastating blow for everyone who works in the travel industry.What are the UKaposs new travel rules   The government has now said that travellers heading into the UK will need to take a Covid test before their departure to try and limit the spread of the virus upon peopleaposs arrival into the country. This can be either a lateral flow or PCR test.  Travel from so-called aposred listapos countries where Covid rates are high require people to isolate for  days. Nigeria is the most recent addition to this list. Rules dfer for fully vaccinated people and the non-vaccinated. Travel rules for the fully vaccinated When you have arrived in the UK, you must take a PCR test before your second day in the country and isolate until receiving a negative result.You also need to complete a passenger locator form, which must be shown as you check in to travel on any form of transport to the UK from abroad. Government guidance says: You’ll need to show your form when you check in to travel or board your plane, train or ferry to the UK. You can submit the form any time in the  hours before you arrive in the UK. Travel rules for the non-vaccinated If you have not been vaccinated or are not fully vaccinated and you are travelling to the UK, then you will need to abide by the following rules:take a Covid- test – to be taken in the  days before you travel to England book and pay for day  and day  Covid- PCR tests – to be taken after arrival in England complete a passenger locator form – to be completed in the  hours before you arrive in EnglandRead MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonCoronavirusSajid Javid MPOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Grace Westwood had a party in the playroom in the only home she has ever known months after surviving a stroke. The youngster from Birmingham made history when she was fitted with the Berlin Heart machine in May. Her parents Becci and Darren told the Mirror how they cannot give her the one gt she desperately needs – the gt of le in the form of a donated heart.Without that operation she will never be able to leave Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital to enjoy her childhood at home with big brother Josh. Mum Becci said: “We are so glad we can make these memories, because we didn’t knowGrace would reach her birthday. “But milestones like these are a painful reminder how long we have been here.” Being reliant on a mechanical heart carries signicant risks and last month Grace suffered a stroke that left her temporarily paralysed down the right side of her body. She appears to have made a full recovery the paralysis but now her parents are desperate for a transplant to take place in case it happens again.  Before receiving her heart machine, Grace had spent  months in hospital after developing cardiomyopathy in March . Darren said: “It has made a huge dference. We can go outside, as long as we stay on the hospital grounds. So Grace can experience some of the simple things she missed out on, like touching the grass and listening to the birds sing.” Becci said: “We have no idea how long it will take to find a suitable heart for Grace. We don’t know how much longer she can wait.” Organ donation is now an opt out system in the UK after The Mirror’s Change The Law For Le campaign led to the introduction of Max and Keira’s Law in May last year.

Paige Bliss, , spent five days in intensive care but her condition worsened and she was told she could die as her daughter Miley was taking all her nutrients and extra oxygen. The beautician, from Birmingham, West Midlands, underwent an emergency C-section in August but was unable to meet her newborn until she recovered from the highly infectious virus. After spending nine weeks in the newborn intensive care unit , -week-old Miley is set to celebrate her first Christmas at home. Paige said: “I have no idea how I caught the virus but I suddenly had a runny nose and flu-like symptoms. “After five days, I was breathless so I rang  who called me an ambulance. My oxygen was low and I began to get worse.  “Within two days, I was in intensive care and the doctors began to question what to do with the baby. Paige was given a c-pap mask but her condition did not improve.Doctors saidshe did not deliver her baby, she could die as she was not able to take any medication due to her pregnancy.I was reluctant at first and more worried about my unborn baby than myself but I had no choice, she said. Paige agreed to an emergency C-section after five days in ICU and her daughter was born on August  weighing the same as a carton of milk at lb oz.  She added: “I was so scared in case something bad happened to her. “I was put to sleep for the C-section so I didn’t even see her nor meet her for a whole week after. I was put on a ventilator straight after her birth then I had to wait until I recovered from the virus. “It was the worst thing ever.” Her partner Mason Taylor, , was at Miley’s side who was in and out of critical care.  He printed off pictures for the first time mum but she admitted fearing they may not bond. “I was worried in case I wouldn’t be able to bond with her but thankfully we bonded straight away, Paige said. “My heart was so full from the moment I held her. She was so poorly and there were machines everywhere.” Miley was on a ventilator from birth as she had sticky lungs. She underwent two blood transfusions during her nine-week stay at Heartlands and Good Hope hospital in Birmingham.  Paige said: “I feel lucky that Miley and I are both alive. She frightened us a few times as she was so small and fragile. “She had some breathing problems but she was determined to get better.” Miley’s due date was November  and she was the same size as a coke bottle when she was born. “She is still tiny and weighs lb oz but she is doing fine, she added. “She wears tiny baby clothes and there is a chance she may develop a little slower, but she is here and that is all that matters. “Mason and I are so excited for our first Christmas as a three.  After the traumatic experience, Paige praised the aposamazingapos staff at the hospitals for their care.

She died just six weeks after receiving a terminal cancer diagnosisLisa Harrison, , from Willington, lost her mother to an aggressive brain tumour in November this year Image: Lisa HarrisonByFaith PringLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Dec A mum who thought her medication was making her unwell died just six weeks after receiving a terminal cancer diagnosis. Marion Greenwood, , was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in September after complaining of dizziness and feeling generally unwell.Her daughter Lisa Harrison, , from Willington in Derbyshire, said the family thought her dizzy spells were due to her medication, DerbyshireLive reports.Lisa said: “You know, we thought it was down to high blood pressure tablets, you don’t think when you feel dizzy that it’s a brain tumour, so it’s just a matter of going through the motions with it.“Things started to happen quite quickly with the small droop of the mouth and then we thought she’d had a stroke.  Then it wasn’t until she went into the hospital, you know my dad rang for  after the paramedics had been there the night before and then a scan showed a mass on the brain. “Every week we lost some more of mum, it went from there to losing one side of her mobility, so every weekend there was something dferent that had happened.” On September , Marion was referred to the neurology unit at Queen’s Medical Centrein Nottingham and had another MRI scan. She underwent a biopsy a few days later but by then, Marion was unable to move on her own and she lost her peripheral vision. On October , she received the results of a biopsy which showed she had a grade  glioblastoma multorme . Marion passed away on November , peacefully at home. Her daughter said she would be greatly missed by their entire family, particularly for her brother Jason, , who was suffering from Covid- while his mother was in hospital. He was prevented from seeing her while she was able to communicate properly, Lisa said.  She said: “My brother had Covid while she was in hospital so he couldn’t go and see her which was really hard because he wanted to see her obviously. We knew time was ticking on, but he never really got to see her when she was actually in a better state of mind and being able to talk and stuff. “He managed to see her towards the end of her losing her speech, which was a bit upsetting really, and that he didn’t get to spend those vital days with her because he got Covid. “But every day was a special day, you know. We had to take it all as it came and be thankful for that day, that we had her for another day extra.” Lisa has now turned her attention to fundraising for brain tumour research. She claims that only one percent of funds for cancer research are targeted at finding a cure for brain tumours. She said: “ is going to be a very busy year. “We need to get the awareness out there to help others because it needs to be brought to the forefront and to help other people. “It’s not just the elderly that get brain tumours, it’s little children, it can happen to everybody, it’s indiscriminate. “The tumour that mum had started in the brain, and stayed in the brain, but the rest of her body was cancer-free.”You can access Lisaaposs fundraiser forbrain tumour research here.Matthew Price, community development manager for Brain Tumour Research, said: “Our sincere condolences go to Lisa, Jason and Peter, and to all those who knew and loved Marion. “Less than % of those diagnosed with a brain tumour survive beyond five years compared with an average of % across all cancers. Unlike most other cancers, incidences of and deaths from brain tumours are rising. “We are very grateful for Lisa’s support and are thinking of her and all of Marion’s loved ones at this very dficult time.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Willington PLCMarion GreenwoodLisa HarrisonHospitalsBlood pressure\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A large number of children were admitted with coronavirus last month in Tshwane, the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria, raising concerns that the newly identied Omicron could pose greater risks for young children than other iants.  This could, in part, be because children have not been offered the Covid vaccine as much as adults,at all.Children  years and under were not yet eligible for a jab in South Africa. But mathematician and professor of operational research Prof Christina Pagel, who works at University College London, did not think the trend was a result of the vaccine programme. Vaccination rates were low across all age bands in South Africa, she said. But it is worrying. Something has changed about the virus that is now affecting children under five, and we donapost know what it is,” she added.Downing Street has said there is “no hard evidence” to suggest children are worse affected by the Omicron iant, according toSun Online reports.It was not clear how the iant would behave and spread from country to country. Up until now, children have been largely unaffected by the virus, only suffering mildly from the virus in the majority of cases. It was not clear at this stage how the emergence of Omicron could change this. Scientists are yet to determine what severity of illness is caused by the Omicron iant, first detected in southern Africa last month and since seen in more than  countries, and whether it may be more resistant to existing vaccines. But an article by the South African Medical Research Council based on early observations at the Steve Biko Tshwane District Hospital Complex in Pretoria over the last two weeks contained reassuring signs. The common symptoms of Covid have altered slightly through the pandemic in response to new emerging iants as well as the vaccines. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association who first sounded the alarm about the Omicron iant, has claimed it causes dferent symptoms. The main Omicron symptoms she had seen in young men, she said, were:Fatigue Body aches HeadacheAccording to Dr Coetzee, who is also on the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccines, patients so far had not reported loss of smell or taste. Meanwhile, public health specialist Ntsakisi Maluleke, who works in the Gauteng province, told Reuters that many patients were reporting “non-specic” flu-like symptoms such as a scratchy throat. Ms Maluleke urged adults not to take flu-like symptoms lightly and to get tested with haste. While she reassured children were more likely to suffer only “mild disease”, there has been mixed reporting around whether the new iant was causing mild or serious illness in children in South Africa. Dr Rudo Mathivha, of Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, said children were becoming more ill as a result of the virus than before. We are now seeing them [children] coming in with moderate to severe symptoms needing supplemental oxygen, needing supportive therapy, needing to stay in hospital for quite a number of days,” she said. The NHS lists the three main symptoms of Covid in children and adults as:a high temperature a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot, for more than an hour, or  or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to sense of smell or taste Experts on the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app have urged parents tolook for other common signsin children including: fatigue headache fever sore throat loss of appetiteRead MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSReuters AGUniversity College LondonSteve BikoAppsHospitalsTherapyFluCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByMya BollanTrainee Trends WriterDiana Buntajova:,  Dec Those who regularly reach for the box of paracetamol to keep an ache or pain at bay should be aware of what the warning signs of the possible side effects look like. From reducing a fever to keeping that hangover at bay, the painkiller can be taken in the form on tablets, capsules, syrup or as a dissolvable tab. It is also an ingredient of many other types of medication. However, much like any other medicine, paracetamol has a list of possible side effects. These warning signs can be a range of things, including something you might notice when using the loo. The NHS reports that paracetamol “rarely” causes side effectsyou stick to the right dosage.The usual recommended dose is one or two  milligram tablets taken up to four times in a -hour period, according to the health body.However, like any drug, paracetamol also has possible side effects some people can experience, reports The Express.One side effect, which warrants medical help and ceasing its use, is dark pee, as reported by Drugs.Dark pee is associated with another side effect of the drug - jaundice. Jaundice describes your skin and the whites of your eyes turning yellow.  The health portal Patient.Info explains that jaundice can occur because of paracetamol poisoning. This can cause acute liver failure, which may turn your skin and eyes yellow. Jaundice is triggered by high blood levels of the bile pigment called bilirubin in your body. This bile can turn your pee dark. Apart from dark urine, jaundice can also be spotted when you have a poo as it can colour your stool clay.If you experience any symptoms linked to jaundice you need to get “urgent medical help”, the NHS warns.Drugs also advises stopping taking paracetamolyou’re doing so. However, jaundice and toilet signs are not common paracetamol side effects. To see a full list of possible side effects, refer to the patient information leaflet that came with your medicine. To avoid any unwanted problems caused by the drug, the NHS stresses the importance of sticking to the right dose. Another “serious” side effect that can happen in some cases is an allergic reaction to the medicine. The warning signs to spot include: Skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin Wheezing Tightness in the chest or throat Trouble breathing or talking Swelling of mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat. It’s important to go to AE or call you experience symptoms like these.

A month after the -year-old dog passed away, Andrea McNally has now created a beautul festive tribute for her beloved Staffordshire bull terrier, Boycie. The -year-old saved the stick from Boycie’s final walk before he fell ill, and has adorned it with fairy lights, baubles and decorations, now proudly hanging in her home in Maidstone, Kent. She said: “Boycie was a good boy and a really lovely dog. Whenever we went out we would bring him a stick back, and when we found out he wasn’t very well, we started saving a couple because I’d seen an idea on Pinterest that I wanted to do - and I knew just the right dog to find me one.”  Boycie was known to keep the family’s garden fire-pit well stocked with wood, but there was one stick he brought home on his final walk that Andrea knew would be perfect for her tribute. The mum-of-three added: “I got some lights and decorations that I liked and decided to get crafty with it, because I like to do stuff like that. “It’s not been a great year, so I wanted to get the Christmas decorations up to feel a bit festive, and this is definitely one I’ll be getting out every year now.” The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter. Boycie had to be put to sleep four weeks ago after vets discovered a tumour on his heart that would be dficult to operate on. Andrea said: “Over the last year he started having infections, sore paws and then his breathing was getting a bit laboured. We took him to the vets and they said he had a tumour on his heart, but because of his age it wasn’t worth putting him through the surgery, so we had to say goodbye to him about four weeks ago. But now Andrea, who is married with three children, has five-year-old Staffy, Boe, and new French bulldog puppy, Bobby, to keep her busy over the festive season. The -year-old shared her Christmas decoration on a Facebook group dedicated to Staffordshire bull terriers, and wrote: “Lost my best boy recently and he loved to collect big sticks out on walks. He would often bring them home.He picked up a stick on his last walk and I decided to make a Xmas decoration from it. Thought I would share it because they turned out well. Great way to remember a great friend.” Other dog owners fell in love with the idea, with one writing: “Oh my this made me cry losing your dog is so heartbreaking this is a really lovely reminder.” Another added: “What a great tribute to a great friend. It looks absolutely beautul. And makes him part of your Christmas celebrations.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsIce creamChristmas decorations\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He maintained he was simply leaving the sauna in facilities that were often shared with female riders. Frost alleged Dunne had called her a “f****** whore” and a “dangerous ****” after a race last year. He categorically denies using such language. A witness claimed he’d called her “a f****** slut”.  Other jockeys maintain they’d heard “nothing out of the ordinary.” Several female jockeys gave evidence that while he was “not to everyone’s taste”, they did not find him “inappropriate” or “bullying”. Make up your own mind. Frost wept last week as she spoke of the way she said been ostracised by her colleagues for even raising her claims with the authorities. But she insisted the other female jockeys were terried of talking for fear of being exiled from racing’s equivalent of the dressing room – the weighing room. “Personally speaking,” she said, “the isolation I have found from speaking out, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I feel they are protecting themselves and staying neutral.”  Whatever the verdict in this week’s case, you wouldn’t blame Frostshe were to quit British racing. It would ­represent a huge blow for a sport desperately trying to attract younger audiences and participants. But to read last week’s evidence, you might interpret a toxic climateyou are dferent.The British Horseracing Authority, the sport’s rulers, has concluded the culture of the weighing room “condones threatening behaviour and frowns upon the reporting of it”.Another female jockey, Hannah Welch, gave evidence at last week’s hearing and spoke of an incident in her early s when she claimed she was shouted and sworn at by Dunne and left in tears. The other jockeys looked on. No one, she said, stood up for her. She has since quit. Another female jockey, Leonna Mayor, claimed on TV at the weekend that she’d been bullied by a trainer she wouldn’t name. The sport has serious questions to answer. Frost is entirely right to stand up for what she believes in.

She and her aunt are now fighting in court over a £, homeAnabel Mattingley outside High Court during hearing in battle over her mums will Image: Champion NewsByLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Dec A university student who says her dying mum’s sister betrayed a “promise to look after her” is embroiled in a bitter family row over a £, house. Anabel Mattingley, , says before her mother Kim died in  she trusted her sister Karen Bugeja would care for her daughter emotionally and financially after she was gone. Anabel told Londonaposs High Court that Kim Mattingley, a former JP Morgan banker, did not leave her £, house directly to her daughter in her will because she was worried that her ex-husband would lay claim to it. Instead, she left the property to her sister but set up a secret trust verbally, ensuring that Karen knew a share of the property was to be owned by Anabel. Anabel and her aunt are now fighting in court.  Karen has insisted that her promise to her sister created only a moral obligation and not a legal route for Anabel to claim ownersapos rights over the property. The court heard that Kim Mattingley died after having been diagnosed with skin cancer which later spread. She had enjoyed a successful career in banking, before becoming an alternative therapist and moving from her £, house in Kings Hill, Kent, to Switzerland, where she died in . Kim and Karen’s mother, Joan White, moved into Kimaposs house, having paid off the mortgage for her. The home remained under Kim’s name but she signed over a -year lease allowing her mum to live there, as well as giving her sister a % share of the value to reflect the cash their mum had poured in. Anabel is now demanding that her aunt sign over a .% share of the house to her, claiming she has betrayed a promise she made to her dying sister by hanging onto the ownership Kim handed her in her will. Speaking in the witness box, the student told Judge Malcolm Davis-White QC that her mum had expected her sister to care for her daughter after her death and had even looked into making her Anabelaposs legal . She added that Karen had understood that she was meant to pass a .% share of the house legally to Anabel. She told the judge: ”My mother told me it would be enough for me to put down for a house. She told me Karen would look after it and provide to me what was necessary. She tried very hard to make me understand and listen. I didnapost want to have the conversation because I didnapost want to contemplate the fact that she was going to die.”  Explaining why her share of the property was not just left to her in the will, she added: She didnapost want my father to get any of it. She thought she was doing the right thing in getting my aunt to look after it and that she would provide for me.” Representing Karen, barrister Adrian Carr told Anabel: The only instructions were that the property would go to your aunt and be held for the benefit of your grandmother. Thataposs what your mother said in her will. Thereaposs nothing to suggest that there was a secret trust. There is no specic mention of a binding obligation on your aunt. This is a straightforward simple will, where your mother directed that your aunt should have the house to look after your grandmother. Anabel denied the lawyer’s claim, saying that her mum had told Karen during a crucial conversation that she wanted the share of the house to pass legally to her daughter and Karen had “agreed. I think the instructions have created a trust, she told the judge, adding that after her mumaposs death her aunt had told her she didnapost deserve to have any of it and that it was our grandmotheraposs house”. Karen told the judge she wants to protect Joan, her and Kim’s mother, who still lives in the house, and has a lease which is coming towards its end. In the will she left me the house, she said. Both my sister and I considered it to be our motheraposs house. Anabel was telling me it was her house. Iaposm fighting this because I didnapost believe my sister would have told me that I was obliged legally to give Anabel a share of a property my mother lives in. Mum paid the mortgage off. She was entitled to have the house. It was her home for  years. In my opinion she is morally entitled to it. She told the barrister that once her mum has moved out of the home and has her care costs covered, she would consider passing some of the value on to Anabel, but that this would be a discretionary choice on her part, rather than Anabelaposs legal right. Anabel has been left the remainder of her mumaposs estate under the will including assets in Switzerland and Spain. The judge has now reserved his decision in the case to be delivered at a later date.

All travellers will be required to take a Covid- pre-departure test, amid warnings that the time between infection and infectiousness could be shorter with the new strain.It comes as Professor Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app, said that in around  daysapos time the UK could have more cases of Omicron than some countries it had put on the travel red list.The professor of genetic epidemiology at Kingaposs College London told BBC Breakfast: The official estimates are about -odd Omicron cases, and because the current testing is missing a lot of those, itaposs probably at least , to , I would guess at the moment.And we are expecting this to be doubling about every two days at the moment, soyou do your maths - say assumed itaposs , at the moment, and you think itaposs going to be doubling every two days, you can see that those numbers are going to be prettycertainly in about  days time. By that time, weaposll probably have more cases than they will in some of those African countries.  So I think these travel restrictions do perhaps have their place initially, when cases are really low here and really high in the other country, but when we reach that equilibrium, thereaposs very little point in having them in my opinion. He said that data from the Zoe symptom study app suggests that about half of all cases at the moment of Delta are being missed because they are not presenting with classic Covid symptoms of fever, new and persistent cough and a loss or change of smell or taste. Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild iants weaposre seeing in people who have been vaccinated with Delta than anything , he said. And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people wonapost recognise as Covidthey just believe the official Government advice.Health Secretary Sajid Javid cautioned the iant was spreading within communities, rather than just being linked to international travel. And the decision on pre-departure tests followed calls from Labour to implement the process. It will mean anyone travelling to the UK from countries not on the red list will be required to take a pre-departure test a maximum of  hours before leaving, regardless of their vaccination status. Andthey test positive, they will not be allowed to travel. Scotland and Wales have said they will implement similar measures. However, the requirement was greeted with anger and dismay across the travel sector. On Monday, Mr Javid said: “The Omicron iant is continuing to spread here and around the world. “According to the latest data there are now  confirmed cases in England,  in Scotland and four in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases across the UK to .  “This includes cases with no links to international travel. So, we can conclude that there is now community transmission across multiple regions of England.” He said the Government cannot “say for certain” whether Omicron will escape Covid vaccines, or how severe a disease it will cause. He told MPs: “We are learning more about this new iant all the time. “Recent analysis from the UK Health Security Agency suggests that the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron iant than for the Delta iant, but we don’t yet have a complete picture of whether Omicron causes more severe disease or indeed how it interacts with the vaccines. “We can’t say for certain at this point whether Omicron has the potential to knock us off our road to recovery.” He added: “We are leaving nothing to chance. Our strategy is to buy ourselves times and to strengthen our defences while our world-leading scientists assess this new iant and what it means for our fight against Covid-.”  But he said of the cases identied so far, none had resulted in hospital admission. Mr Javid said the measures were temporary, and acknowledged they would cause disruption. He said: “We’re taking this early action now so we don’t have to take tougher action later on, and so that we can take every opportunity to prevent more cases from arriving in our country.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Government must now do “whatever it can” to lower the price of Covid- pre-departure tests. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Vina Shaddick paid just £ for the lights during a shopping trip to Woolworths in . When she died in  they were inherited by her son Ross Farr-Semmens, . Ross hopes to pass the lights onto his daughter Ronnie, currently eight months old. He said: “It is literally magic that they can still be part of all the Christmas festivities. It’s an important new year for the lights and my family. “There’s been lots of additions this year. I got married to my amazing we Ruth, and we’ve also had a newborn baby who’s now eight months old. “With mum buying them in  it really is just amazing to be part of their continuing success and special place in the household helping us all to celebrate Christmas in style.” The lights, which are attached to a s plastic Christmas tree, were turned on today. Last year there was a brief moment of concern when the bulbs took several seconds to light up.  But music teacher Ross, of Plymouth, Devon, has consulted an electrician to check they are still safe. He said: “We’ve never needed to change a bulb, which is good because I’ve lost track of where the spares were.” Ross even considered paying to have all the wiring updated.

Every evening, the colossal inflatable - which is joined by an equally impressive Santa - have led to crowds of people stopping for selfies. The pair are so big, reaching up to the eaves and roof, they actually mask half the property from their street in Letchworth, Herts. George White, , who persuaded his parents to put up the mammoth decorations at their -year-old home, said he thought everyone “could do with cheering up”.

After the icy temperatures and disruption caused by Storm Arwen the mercury will drop again going into Tuesday bringing snow in parts of the country and heavy rain in other areas. Wind really picking up in the west and around some exposed southern coasts with  to mph wind gusts on the more exposed spots and mph inland, said a Met Office forecaster. Follow our live blog here for the latest updates on Storm Barra.  “It is going to feel cold wherever you are with the wind picking up during the day, especially cold in the north and the east and as a result when the rain arrives in the north we are likely to see a spell of snow. I think rain around the coasts but around northern England, central, southern Scotland, snow falling even to lower levels with the snow really building up on the higher ground, m about two to five centimetres of snow and over some of the higher parts of northern England and Scotland  to cm of snow. That of course accompanied by gale force winds will lead to blizzards and drting so some really treacherous conditions for northern England, central and southern Scotland during the second half of Tuesday likely to affect the higher roads like the M and M in places. The Royal National Leboat Institutionhas urged people to stay well back from the water’s edge and to dial  for the coastguard in any coastal emergency.  The Environment Agency has issued three flood warnings for England’s south coast, as well as  flood alerts.

Boris Johnson said he had spoken to the chief executive of Northern Powergrid and had been “assured they would be reconnected tomorrow at the latest”.Later on Monday evening, the electricity supplier said it had reduced the number of homes and businesses affected to .  There are fears now of more power cuts and damage to buildings from Storm Barra. There is worry that gale-force winds could also make it more dficult for engineers to reconnect homes, though spokesman Stephen Dixon said winds would “gradually weaken” as they move east and should have petered out by Thursday. Following a call with the boss of Northern Powergrid, Phil Jones, the prime minister tweeted he had “asked for assurances that the energy supply companies were putting in place measures to limit any potential further disruption to households as a result of Storm Barra”. The energy minister, Greg Hands, said on Monday it was “completely unacceptable” that around , households were still without power. Labour has accused the government of treating people in Scotland and the north of England as “second-class citizens”. Residents in the affected areas have said they were losing hope and feeling “fed up and angry” as they faced an th night without electricity. A deadline set last Wednesday to restore power supply to all properties by the end of the week was missed.

A rare red alert has been issued in the Republic of Ireland, while disruptive wind and some snow are expected to hit parts of northern England and Scotland, the Met Office said. Power giants promised to get , homes still without electricity reconnected before it blew in from the Atlantic. But experts warned electricity lines could again be felled by aposStorm Barraapos.A low-pressure system qualies as a weather ‘bomb’its centre deepens by  millibars in  hours.It is expected the one behind the latest extreme conditions will deepen even further than that before it lands on our shores.Frank Saunders, Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “Gusts of - mph are expected widely, with - mph in exposed coastal locations.”There could be cm of snow in the Scottish Highlands.  In Ireland, health officials warned people to expect disruptions to services – including Covid- testing and vaccination centres – while the Department of Education recommended all schools in areas covered by red and orange weather warnings should not open on Tuesday. According the Irish Meteorological Service, Met Éireann, the red weather warning is a rare caution - used only under circumstances of “extremely dangerous destructive” weather. Irish PM Micheal Martin said Storm Barra would be “very, very serious” and advised people to “avoid the coast at all costs”. The latest storm could not have come at a worst time for those who faced an th night with no heating - and aposno hopeapos. Stewart Sexton, of Alnwick, Northumberland, said Northern Powergrid had promised their power would be restored within  hours every day since it was cut off on Nov  by the  mph winds of Storm Arwen. Itaposs exhausting, itaposs wearing us down, and itaposs a constant worry. Every day seems to bring a new problem, he said. We have not got any hope at all. Itaposs awful, the futility of it. Northern Powergrid has handed out survival packs of a small blanket, hot water bottle, mug, pair of socks, glove and hat - but no logs, candles or batteries, he added.Anna Elson, , also of Alnwick, headed for a relativeaposs home with her son, , who also has rheumatoid arthritis, to avoid an th night without heating.Locals had aposcome togetherapos. But she said: We are fed up and angry at the lack of response.  The majority without power were in the north east of England where there are still , homes without electricity. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networkssaid power had been restored to all , affected customers on Sunday. The Irish weather service, Met Eireann, named “Storm Barra” as it hit their west coast at the week-end. Now it is heading our way.“It is not good news,” said Dan Stroud, of the Met Office. “There is a low pressure out in the Atlantic. As it approaches, it deepensexplosively.It is going to bring in a wide band of rain, bumping into cold air over Scotland and turning readily to snow. The first met Office yellow warning comes into force at am on Tuesday. The Energy Network Association said that operators were working together to prepare for the storm. Elsewhere, a cabinet minister has come under fire for taking a trip to the US while hundreds of her constituents were still without power. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has said there are “huge opportunities to deepen trading links ahead of a three-day visit to the US.

They are his words. Arenapost people in the North entitled to think he is right  They have been treated as second-class citizens. Mr Miliband also said lessons had not been learned from past storms, telling MPs the Tories had failed to identy problems of communication, the vulnerability of the network, and the complacency of the companies. The costs of paying for temporary accommodation will make for a very expensive Christmas, North West Durham MP Richard Holden said. He added: Many of them will have spent a huge amount of money, of their own cash, going into hotels or in other accommodation and on extra food. Business minister Greg Hands admitted people who experienced a power cut during Storm Arwen may have to wait three months for compensation. Anne Marieaposs office was approached for a comment.

Mandy Seager, from Blackley, Manchester, said she has had “constant problems” with her boiler for more than a month and was left without any central heating at all, for more than a week. The -year-old said her flat became like an “iceberg” when a cold snap hit the UK at the end of November. She said she had no option but to cocoon herself in blankets, but was still “absolutely freezing as the coldest night of the year gripped the UK on November . Mandy rents her council home from Northwards Housing, who manage properties on behalf of Manchester City Council. She told theManchester Evening Newsshe had experienced problems with her heating since the beginning of November.This was the longest time it has ever not been working for and it was unbearable,” she said. I had to just sit in my lounge wrapped up in blankets or just stay in bed under the covers. It was actually warmer in the corridor outside my flat. It was like an iceberg. Nobody should have to be that cold in their own home.” After a journalist contacted Manchester City Council, who manages Northwards Housing, Mandyaposs central heating was fixed for the third time on December . The council had also been called out on November  and November , but Mandy claimed she had tried to make contact with the housing provider for a week before. Although the heating has now been repaired, Northwards Housing acknowledged there is a recurring issue with the heating system in the apartment. Mandy claims she was previously told the system needed flushing before it then broke again and left her in the freezing cold for “almost two weeks”. She says she was given a small fan heater in the meantime, which she says was eating up her electric bill. She wrapped herself in bed sheets and throws on the coldest night of the year, where temperatures in Manchester plummeted as low as C. Storm Arwen battered most of the country, bringing freezing temperatures and strong winds. Mandy added: I had to sit in front of the fan heater and then run straight to bed and get under the duvet to keep warm. It had been eating away at my electric bill. It costs a fortune. It was absolutely horrendous. It has just been so cold, it is just like sitting outside.It is the worst thing to be sat in the cold, especially with how bad the weather has been recently.It is fixed again now but I will have problems with it again soon and I will be left in the same situation. She added that she became desperate to get out the house when she rises for work at  am. Manchester City Council has since responded to Mandyaposs claims, saying that on both occasions she complained, engineers attended the property to repair the heating. A spokesperson said: Northwards Housing received a repair request from Mandy on  November and  November. Both requests were regarding the heating system and contractor Equans attended the property on the same day on both occasions. Their heating was reported as working following each visit. Equans have now attended the property againand the system has been left fully operational. Unfortunately, the issue with the heating system seems to be recurring and requires air to be vented periodically. We understand that this is really frustrating - especially at this time of year - and investigations will continue until the cause of the problem is identied and resolved.

The revelation comes after weekend reports that investigators found evidence of Class A drug abuse in the corridors of power. The Prime Minister joined a drugs raid on Merseyside today, to highlight the Government’s week-long drive on crime. The Tory leader, who signalled middle-class drug users could be stripped of their passports, has previously bragged about snorting cocaine at university. He told GQ magazine in : “I tried it at university and I remember it vividly, and it achieved no pharmacological, psychotropical or any other effect on me whatsoever.”  He had claimed he sneezed it out, but askedsome “did creep in to your big hooter”, he admitted: “It must have done, yes, but it didn’t do much for me, I can tell you.”Asked about weekend claims that newspaper investigators found evidence of cocaine use in Palace of Westminster toilets, a top Government minister today admitted he would be surprisedpeople were not taking narcotics in Parliament.Policing Minister Kit Malthouse told Sky News: “There are obviously several thousand people who work on the estate and I would be surprisedthere weren’t some lestyle users of drugs amongst them.” The Mirror spoke to Westminster insiders about drugs being taken on the parliamentary estate. One adviser said: “There’s a culture of work hard, play hard. “There’s also a culture of people who don’t really live by the rules that other people live by. “There’s lots of affairs, lots of MPs live a certain way during the week and a completely dferent way at the weekend - they live dferent lives.” The adviser recalled one booze-fuelled evening in Parliament’s Strangers’ Bar. She told how one Tory ed from the toilet where she had obviously been snorting cocaine. “She was clearly out of it, I looked at her face and I could see a globule of cocaine hanging out of her nostril,” said the insider. “I was like, ‘Is that what I think it is  Oh, yes it is’.” Another Westminster source told how they suspected some young researchers - many of them in their first paid job and straight out of university, where they may have been exposed to narcotics for the first time - often added something “harder” to their nights out. “You can see people getting p****d and that’s fair enough as we all work long hours,” said the source. “But sometimes people disappear to the loos for a while and they come back and you can tell from their eyes they’re off their face. “It’s either really brave or really stupid to do it in Parliament, given how many cops there are everywhere.” Another source told how they had on several occasions been to the lavatories and spotted white powder which they assumed to be cocaine. The Sunday Times reported this week that evidence of cocaine use was found in the toilets close to the Commons offices of PM Mr Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel. It was also discovered in the disabled lavatory on the Shadow Cabinet corridor. The PM’s spokesman said today: “Those reports are concerning and I know the Speaker has already talked about taking action on that.” He added: “We do know that drugs are prevalent in society and that’s why we are focused on tackling this issue.” Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has previously admitted Parliament has a “drug problem”. Speaking in autumn , when he was the senior deputy Speaker, he said: “It’s not just drink we’ve got to catch out, there is a drug problem.” Police snfer dogs could be deployed under plans for a crackdown. Tory MP Charles Walker, who chairs the Administration Committee and sits on the House of Commons Commission, said: “The House of Commons has a long history of using snfer dogs to detect explosives. “It may be that we now need to broaden the range of snfer dogs ... to include those which can detect drugs.” A Parliamentary spokeswoman said: “Parliament takes the issue of substance misuse very seriously, and should drug use be identied in Parliament, appropriate action would be taken. “Any allegation of criminal behaviour would be a matter for the politan Police. “It is important to stress that Parliament is a public place with facilities accessed by Members, staff, contractors, press, and members of the public.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative Partypolitan PoliceHouse of CommonsPriti PatelKit MalthouseBoris JohnsonCharles WalkerLindsay HoyleDrugsPoliticsCocaine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Candice said: “In September  I had the fillers that were in my lips, cheeks and jawline all removed. “I realised that it wasn’t enhancing my beauty to continue to get this kind of work, it was making me look older having so much in my face. “A lot of young women get filler to look younger but we don’t realise when it’s gone too far. aposI spent years looking fake but now I want to be a natural beauty.  “Now that Iaposve got rid of it I feel so much better. “I had forgotten what my face looked like without filler!” Candiceaposs family and friends were used to her Barbie-like appearance but when she first started transforming into a doll, the modelaposs parents were a bit shocked.

The dad-of-four, who currently has more than , followers, created his first Yorkie pie by filling a pudding with mash potato and smoothing it out with a spoon. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. He then added pulled pork, before adding a perfectly round slice of cheese on top, before repeating both steps again. Roland then placed a pastry lid on top of the creation and topped it with egg wash, before placing it in the oven for  minutes. At the end of the clip, the project manager can be seen revealing the golden brown result, before slicing right into the middle of it, to reveal a gooey cross section. Roland then reveals the golden-brown result and slices his concoction in half to show the gooey, delicious cross-section. It tasted seriously good. I went for pulled pork as I had some leftover. I did a Yorkshire toastie video, then suddenly thought that a Yorkie would make a perfect pie base, the dad explained. Fill it and stick a pastry lid on it. The kids loved it. I checked through TikTok and couldn’t see that anybody  had done it. It got a really good response. The clip received more than . million views and after collecting so many positive comments, Roland decided to create a number of dferent iations of the dish, including one which featured a filling of KFC popcorn chicken. Yes mate that looks incredible, while another suggested: You need to make your own puds mate you can’t use ant Bessie’s up here. Nah thataposs a Yorkshire lasagne pal, a third commented, while another said he deserved to go straight to jail for creating the concoction.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Both the teenager and his mother have been arrested by police after the barbaric attack on the -year-old sister. It is alleged her family members murdered her because they did not approve of her marriage.Kirti Thore was killed in the Ladgaon village of Aurangabad when her brother and mother, Shobhabai Mote, went to visit her, reported the Daily Star.She lived with her husbandaposs family in a room next to their farm, reports One India.The brother, believed to be aged  or , carried out the sickening attack when his sisteraposs back was turned.  Assistant Police Commissioner Kailash Prajapati said Kirtiaposs brother attacked her from behind with a sickle while her mother held her legs. He then beheaded her before taking her head outside.“[Kirti] was working in the field with her mother-in-law,” said Prajapati, according to NDTV.“Seeing mother and brother, she left her work in the field and rushed to greet them. She gave water to both of them and went to the kitchen to make tea. This is when her brother came from behind and beheaded her.” He added: “Her husband, who was ill, was lying in the house. He woke up hearing the sound of falling utensils and rushed to the kitchen. The womanaposs brother tried to kill him too but he escaped. “Later, the brother came out of the house with his head in his hand. He then came to the police station and surrendered.” Kirtiaposs father Sanjay is said to have felt insulted after her marriage against his wishes and he left home before ing several days later. Police have found nothing to link him to the crime, it is reported.

If he could travel at the speed of light, well, then his job would be a lot easier. But,we take a look at Einstein’s formula, EMC², this lets us know that anything with mass simply cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Of course, Santa has massand with the weight of all of those presents on top, well, it’s impossible. Once you add all of the nine reindeers, things start getting really heavy. Travelling faster than the speed of light is certainly out of reach now.  As pointed out by The Conversation, luckily there are still other options available to Santa that boost his chances at delivering all of the presents on time for the big day. They relate to what is known in maths as The Travelling Salesman Problem. As detailed by this problem, the example surrounds a salesman who needs to plan a route through dferent cities, having to commence and end his journey in the same city and visit every other city in between just once, all while minimising the distance that he travels. If we take this example and apply it to Santaaposs journey, this is just a festive iant of the Travelling Salesman Problem. The problem with this problem is that it is NP-Complete. Essentially, there is no known efficient algorithm that reliably s the optimal solution in reasonable time. So much so, that some mathematicians and computer scientists believe that no such algorithm exists . If someone proves that it does, or doesn’t exist, they stand a chance of winning  million for winning one of the famed Millennium Problemsthey discover that PNP or not.  With this unsolved problem not exactly helping Santa on his quest, it becomes clear that we don’t currently know of an algorithm that would provide Santa with the best route to take. In this absence, there are however algorithms that attempt to solve this issue in reasonable time. Route Santa from Edinburgh Napier University is one that is striving to solve this problem and crack the code. The interactive map is an example of the algorithm solving the problem. Users are encouraged to contribute to the map and the understanding of Santa’s route by simply adding their address to its list.The list in turn marks the home on the map and Route Santa updates to conceive the best route timing wise for Santa, updating the distance he needs to cover, as well as the speed he would need to be travelling in miles per hour. The more users that sign up, the more efficient Santa’s journey will work out to be and a better understanding weaposll have of the most efficient version of this journey.  That said, many maths whizzes have taken the basic numbers of houses Old St Nick visits, the land mass that needs to be covered, along with the  hour window he has to deliver them to get a rough idea. Science Focus came to the conclusion that Santa must need to travel at a speed of .million kilometres per hour to ensure every child woke up on Christmas morning with a present under the tree.While this is considerably slower than the speed of light it would still mean that he and all the presents would arrive a little worse for wear. Thankfully heaposs magical.So, while the speed at which Santa would have to travel is currently unknown, not to mentionit’d be physically possible, it poses a really important question because the Travelling Salesman Problem affects all of our daily lives. We’re talking about our access to food, everything that we buy and deliveries straight to our door. If the most efficient route for Santa can be solved, then we can apply this finding to ious other aspects of le, something which could revolutionise delivery services going forward.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Father ChristmasMaths-Whizz\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mount Semeru began spewing out hot clouds of ash in Java on Saturday, killing at least  people. Thousands of people have fled their homes and dozens remain missing after the volcano, the tallest mountain on the island, shot a towering ash column into the sky. Military officers, police and residents dug through mud with their hands to pull out victims from the ashen landscape. Indonesiaaposs disaster mitigation agency confirmed the latest death toll along with  people still missing. Mount Semeru is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia and experts have warned of ongoing seismic activity after its second eruption. Liswanto, the head of the Semeru Volcano Observatory, said: Before and after the December  eruption, it will continue to be active.  People need to be more vigilant because the potential threat is still there. Some residents ed to their homes to check on belongings and livestock, but Liswanto urged people to keep a safe distance.Farmers are struggling to feed their animals with food such as grass covered in ash. In the Sumberwuluh area, rescue teams battled poor weather to retrieve victims from the rubble. The weather is the main obstacle, according to the national search and rescue agency Basarnas. Operations director Wuryanto added: Hopefully the weather going forward will be good enough to make it easier for us to search.People have posted photos of missing loved ones on Facebook, with pleas for any information about their whereabouts. Complicating logistics and rescue efforts, lava flows from Saturdayaposs eruption destroyed a bridge connecting two areas in the district of Lumajang with the city of Malang. Public kitchens and health facilities have been set up for more than , people who have been displaced.  Semeru is one of more than  active volcanoes in Indonesia, a country that straddles the Pacic Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity that rests atop multiple tectonic plates.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

of his handling of the evacuation of Afghanistan after a whistleblower alleged he led a ldquodysal and ldquochaotic operation while foreign secretary.Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during the effort, claimed that just % of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help.Some were murdered after being left behind in Kabul after the Taliban swept to power in August, he alleged in devastating written evidence to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.He alleged that Mr Raab ldquodid not fully understand the situation, was slow to rule on cases and requested they were reformatted ldquoin a well-presented table before making a decision.Mr Raab, who was moved to become Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister after his handling of the crisis, sought to defend his record, having already been heavily criticised for holidaying in Crete as the Taliban were storming back to power in Afghanistan.ldquoItrsquos inaccurate in certain respects, the suggestion that junior desk officers were making decisions is just not correct, he told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.ldquoTherersquos a dference between processing and deciding, so Irsquom afraid I donrsquot accept that characterisation.ldquoOn the charge it took several hours to make decisions, wersquore not talking about days, itrsquos not been suggested weeks, but several hours to make sure we had the facts, and that, as between myself, the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary, decisions were made and actually I would suggest thatrsquos a reasonably swt turnaround.One of Mr Marshallrsquos allegations was that at one point the Cabinet minister ldquodeclined to make a decision on whether to admit a group of womenrsquos rights activists ldquowithout a properly formatted submission with a table setting out multiple cases.It would have been reasonable for Mr Raab to defer to the crisis centrersquos judgment but ldquoin the circumstances it is hard to explain why he

the clear facts that each case presented precisely so we can make swt decisions.ldquoSome of the criticism seems rather dislocated from the facts on the ground, the operational pressures that with the takeover of the Taliban, unexpected around the worldhellip I do think that not enough recognition has been given to quite how dficult it was.Among the flaws alleged by Mr Marshall was that the process of selecting who could be airlted out was ldquoarbitrary and dysal and that thousands of emails were going unread.He said that Foreign Office colleagues were ldquovisibly appalled by our chaotic system which was put in place as foreign forces withdrew after a -year occupation of Afghanistan.Tom Tugendhat, the senior Tory MP who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the ldquoserious

personnel from Kabul airport He added that the ldquofailures betrayed our friends and allies and squandered decades of British and Nato effort while he described the evacuation effort as ldquoone of lack of interest, and bureaucracy over humanity.Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said Mr Raab should consider his position in the Cabinet in light of the testimony, which she said she was ldquodisgusted and ldquotruly shocked to hear.ldquoThere is plenty of evidence that Dominic Raab is not capable of making the sort of decisions that our country deserves in any way, the Labour MP told Sky News.Mr Marshall, who worked in the Afghan Special Cases team handling the cases of Afghans who were at risk because of their links with the UK, estimated ldquobetween , and , people including dependents applied for evacuation under the ldquoleave outside the rules category.But he calculated that ldquofewer than % of these people have received any assistance and stated that ldquoit is clear

But what is certainly true is that we had a lot of people rushing to get out of Afghanistan for all sorts of reasons.Mr Marshall also alleged that colleagues lacked knowledge of Afghanistan and that junior officials were ldquoscared by being asked to make hundreds of le-and-death decisions about which they knew nothing.ldquoDesperate and urgent emails, including those with titles such as ldquoPlease save my children, were also being opened but not actioned, he said.ldquoI believe the purpose of this system was to allow the Prime Minister and the then foreign secretary to inform MPs that there were no unread emails, Mr Marshall wrote.He also claimed that at one point he was the only person monitoring an inbox where pleas for help were directed.Foreign Office officials and Britainrsquos ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, are due to give evidence to the select committee on Tuesday afternoon..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Dominic Raab defends Kabul airlts after whistleblower us damning claims"},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-negative-lateral-flow-accepted-place-vaccine-passport-today","story":"Negative lateral flow test resultswill be accepted in venues that require vaccine passports from today, after changes were made to the scheme by the Scottish government.Currently in Scotlandyou are required to show proof that you are fully vaccinatedfor entry intonightclubs, indoor live events with + people unseated, outdoor live events with + peopleunseated and any event with ,+ people.But from today a negative lateral flow test result at these venues will also be accepted.Heres everything you need to know...Can I use a lateral flow test to enter venues requiring a vaccine passport Yes, from Monday December , you can use proof of a negative lateral flow testto enter venues on the vaccine passport scheme in Scotland.Proof of vaccination will also still be accepted for these venues.If using a lateral flow test, it must have been taken within -hours prior to entry.You must report your lateral flow test result on the government website.How do I report my lateral flow test When you take your lateral flow test, you must report it on the Government website, which can be found here.You will then be sent a text or email confirming your result which can be used -negative - for entry to events requiring vaccine certication.Where can I get lateral flow tests Lateral flow tests are available for free from pharmacies and to order from the Scottish government website.Nicola Sturgeon also said that lateral flow tests would become available to collect in more venues in Scotland, including Christmas marketsand sport centres.How can I download proof of vaccination You can download your vaccine passporton your smartphonevia theNHS Scotland Covid Status App.Alternatively, you can order a paper copyof your vaccine passport via yourvaccine portalor phoningthe specially designated Covid status helpline on  , open from am-pm every day..removeWill my booster jab show on my vaccine passport At the moment in Scotland, your booster vaccine will not show on your vaccine passport.However, the Scottish government has said it is working to change this as soon as possible to ensure the booster does appear on your vaccination certication."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-booster-jabs-appear-vaccine-passports-december-9","story":"Scotlands deputy first minister confirmed this morning that the Covid booster jab will appear on Scottish vaccine passports for internationaltravel from December .Speaking on Good Morning Scotland, John Swinney said that proof of the booster jab would appear on vaccine passports for international travel from Thursday this week.He added that this would be extended to the domestic vaccine certicationscheme, however this would take slightly longer to implement.When asked whether booster jabs would be included in the vaccine passport scheme, the deputy first minister said: \"For international travelit will from  December.\"And we will expand that for domestic certication but that will take us a little more time to do that.

Early religious writings tell the story that Thenew was a victim of her fatherrsquos cruel vengeance for what he believed to be her disobedience and wrongful behaviour.One early medieval account by Jocelinus, a monk from Furness, tells us: ldquoBy the kingrsquos command, she was led to the top of a very high hill called Dunpelder, that, cast down from thence, she might be broken limb by limb, or dashed to pieces.But that didnrsquot work, so she was instead taken to the shore of Aberlady and put into the small hide vessel, pulled from the shore and set adrt.Magsrsquo art captures the terror and desperation of Thenewrsquos situation, as her tiny boat is taken by the tide out to the open sea. It is rocked by waves and she clings on for le, the freezing water lapping over her.But thankfully, there is a happy ending to this story. Her small boat begins to drt inland, across the Firth of Forth, away from the kingdom of her abuser and towards the opposite shore, where she lands just in time. There, on the beach by Culross in Fe, she finds a fire with embers still giving warmth.Jocelinus tells us: ldquoThere were, in the neighbourhood, shepherds keeping watch over the flocks. And they beheld a fire lighted close at hand, and coming with haste found the young woman with her childbirth completed, and the child wrapped in rags, lying in the open air. They, moved by pity, took care of them by increasing the fire and supplying food, and procuring other necessarieshellipSt Serf took them in and cared for them, and Thenewrsquos child would become Saint Kentigern.This story is not provable history, of course, more likely itrsquos mostly legend making. Yet unknown truths often lie under the surface of legends and I for one have always seen the universal truths in this story.When I look into the faces of my children, I hope and pray they will never feel the fear and desperation that is on the face of Thenew of being cast at sea with the desperate hope of finding a safe place.And , God forbid, they ever do, I hope they will be met by people like those shepherds.Andever they, or I, were to meet someone in such a desperate situation, then I hope we would be like those shepherds and respond with kindness, understanding and compassion.That, for

around  times higher than those seen in people recovered from Covid - and the Phase Three stage also showed protection of around % against infections caused by the Gamma iant common in Brazil.No serious adverse events were reported and mild side effects were also rare, with fewer than % of participants experiencing fever after the second dose.Medicago, which previously developed a plant-based swine flu vaccine, is now seeking immediate approval from Canadian regulators and is also filing applications for use with UK and US regulators and the World Health Organisation.The vaccine does not have to be frozen and can be kept refrigerated at -degC, making a potential candidate for use in the developing world.Takashi Nagao, CEO and President of Medicago, said: ldquoThis is an incredible moment for Medicago and for novel vaccine s.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney. Casey Construction Ltd. was awarded the contract to carry out the essential maintenance work and improvements.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what is certainly true is that we had a lot of people rushing to get out of Afghanistan for all sorts of reasons.Mr Marshall also alleged that colleagues lacked knowledge of Afghanistan and that junior officials were ldquoscared by being asked to make hundreds of le-and-death decisions about which they knew nothing.ldquoDesperate and urgent emails, including those with titles such as ldquoPlease save my children, were also being opened but not actioned, he said.ldquoI believe the purpose of this system was to allow the Prime Minister and the then foreign secretary to inform MPs that there were no unread emails, Mr Marshall wrote.He also claimed that at one point he was the only person monitoring an inbox where pleas for help were directed.Foreign Office officials and Britainrsquos ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, are due to give evidence to the select committee on Tuesday afternoon.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4289803.jpg--.jpg?1638799790000\n","title":"ballymena boy s artwork brings christmas card cheer","story":"THE festive artwork of  year old Adrian McVey from Castle Tower School in Ballymena has been chosen as Radius Housing’s  Christmas Card.

Castle Tower School is adjacent to a new  home development on the site of the former St Patrick’s Barracks in Ballymena. Radius will begin construction on the site in Spring .

Over the Christmas period Radius will send hundreds of these cards to our partners and friends in Northern Ireland. The children from Tower Castle who painted and drew Christmas images have brought a wonderful festive feeling to Radius.” Alick Ford, teacher at Castle Tower, added: “Castle Tower School was delighted to be asked to be part of Radius Housing’s  Christmas Card competition.

Water does not observe borders. If fracking pollutes the water supply in [Northern] Ireland it will travel south.” Ruffalo encouraged the -plus environmentalists logged on to the meeting to call on Sinn Fein and its MLAs to make sure the Executive votes to ban the licences and “stop fracking once and for all on your beautul island”.Speaking in the Assembly on Monday, Mr Lyons said he had not granted any petroleum licences and planned on bringing forward research carried out by Hatch Regeneris, which studied the implications of both fracking and conventional oil and gas exploration in Northern Ireland, before the end of the year.Friends of the Earth’s Oisin Coghlan said Sinn Fein had been “conspicuously silent” on the proposed petroleum licensing policy despite promising a “total ban on fracking across the island of Ireland, including exploratory drilling” in its manesto before last year’s Dail election.Mr Coghlan added that Mr Lyons’ application would pave the way for fracking.Ruffalo previously used his Twitter account to call on Ms McDonald and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill to wield the party’s votes in the Assembly and ban fracking.Sinn Fein MLA Aine Murphy introduced a Bill to ban fracking last month. But it was branded a “meaningless gesture” by Friends of the Earththe party failed to block petroleum prospecting licences.Related topicsSinn FéinGordon LyonsDepartment for the EconomyMichelle O#NeillEmma RoganMore On Sinn Féin PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionIt’s Sinn Fein who are in denial about republican violence PremiumSale of fake vaccination cards #beneath contempt#: Man based in Republic claims fake certicate would be accepted in NI‘I’d give anything to have you back’: mum posts emotional tribute to tragic Tierna Campbell found dead in Ballynahinch PremiumJon TongeOpinionCitizens’ assemblies are a guide to change, not a cure for all our ills PremiumSam McBrideOpinionSome politicians have used media as an ATM for secret, easy cash for yearsMost ReadBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax billStorm Barra named after BBC NI weather presenterCaravanners take holiday parks battle to StormontFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’Neill‘I’d give anything to have you back’: mum posts emotional tribute to tragic Tierna Campbell found dead in BallynahinchTop VideosPlayWatch: Storm Barra predicted route across UK and Ireland from Met OfficePlayWatch: Storm Barra live tracker mapPlayFountain proposal goes horribly wrongLatest Northern IrelandStorm Barra not expected to cause chaos of Arwen, forecasters predictKirk Millar: Why David Healy doesn’t like to substitute ‘reliable’ Linfield starRobbie Weir has red card rescinded following case of mistaken identity during Crusaders’ loss to GlenavonDungannon Swts vs Warrenpoint Town: Pitch inspection called at Stangmore Park as Storm Barra hits Northern IrelandStorm Barra blasts Ireland with strong winds and heavy rainLatestRoutines revealed for double dance Strictly semi-finalDemarai Gray savours ‘crazy moment’ after scoring Everton winner against ArsenalStorm Barra not expected to cause chaos of Arwen, forecasters predictEngland hoping to avoid another ghastly Gabba start in AshesCovid- weekly deaths among over-s lowest for nearly two months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The industry is seeing Christmas disappear before our eyes.”Janice Gault of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation told the BBC: “In reality, this was a scheme that would have come in at a good time. The idea was it would have acted as a stimulus for the last quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year — a time when we’re traditionally very quiet. It would applied across all sectors of the accommodation industry.“We understand the sensitivities around it, but I think when we have a had a very rough year of trading, it would have been nice to see the scheme go ahead.”Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyGordon LyonsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeDepartment of Finance More On Northern Ireland Assembly PremiumJon TongeOpinionCitizens’ assemblies are a guide to change, not a cure for all our illsWhat are the key points from the  recommendations included in the flags and culture reportFlags report: Paramilitary flags and murals should not be displayed in Northern IrelandNew flag for Northern Ireland and bonfire enforcement among FICT report recommendationsCalls for Stormont’s Communities Department to set up support scheme for those impacted by rising energy costsMost ReadBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax billStorm Barra named after BBC NI weather presenterCaravanners take holiday parks battle to StormontFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’Neill‘I’d give anything to have you back’: mum posts emotional tribute to tragic Tierna Campbell found dead in BallynahinchTop VideosPlayWatch: Storm Barra predicted route across UK and Ireland from Met OfficePlayWatch: Storm Barra live tracker mapPlayFountain proposal goes horribly wrongLatest Northern IrelandRobbie Weir has red card rescinded following case of mistaken identity during Crusaders’ loss to GlenavonStorm Barra blasts Ireland with strong winds and heavy rainStorm Barra arrives, bringing rain, mph winds, and threat of disruptionStorm Barra: Snowfall arrives in Northern Ireland as ‘weather bomb’ sweeps in and batters coastlineIan WoodsOpinionNorthern Ireland and Windsor Park have come a long way but now National Anthem is up for debate againLatestEngland hoping to avoid another ghastly Gabba start in AshesCovid- weekly deaths among over-s lowest for nearly two monthsBooster jabs will be offered to all adults in Wales by end of January – ministerThomas Tuchel runs ‘well-oiled’ system at Cha – Zenit boss Sergei SemakChristopher Eccleston in Big Issue Christmas appeal as temperatures fall,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby.

Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics.

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Almost two-thirdsof internet users aged  to  years refused use of their personal data for advertising purposes, compared with % of persons in the  to  years age group Only % of people said they read a website’s privacy policy statement before providing personal information online.  Ms Delamere said: “As our internet usage continues to increase, so too does the amount of personal information and data which is made available online. “In , almost six in internet users restricted access to their geographical location when using online s, while nearly six in internet users refused allowing the use of personal data for advertising purposes. “Internet users were less likely, however, to limit access to their profile or content on social networking sites or shared online storage, with just under halfof internet users limiting such access.” She added: “Websites that collect personal information require a privacy policy statement, but only % of internet users read them before providing personal information online. “Similarly, even though everyone has the right to access the digital personal data collected by websites or search engines administrator or providers, just % of internet users requested access to their online personal data to update or delete it.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The National Archiveswill present an exhibition thatmarks itsrole as the official repository of the recordsof the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, : Records fromthe Archivesopens up signicant historical records, official documents, and private papers for the first time, includingthe first public presentation of both the Irish and British copies of the Treaty document. The exhibition locatesthe Treaty negotiations in the political context of the Irish revolution beginning with the exploratorytalks betweenEacuteamon de Valera and David Lloyd George during the summer of , itdetailsthe work of the Irish plenipotentiaries and their secretariat, by presenting the documentary record that they left behind.  The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era. Admission to the exhibition is free. Book online at here. This exhibition is presented as part of the Government of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries - National Programme. It runs from December ,  - March ,  from am-pm daily.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The National Archiveswill present an exhibition thatmarks itsrole as the official repository of the recordsof the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, : Records fromthe Archivesopens up signicant historical records, official documents, and private papers for the first time, includingthe first public presentation of both the Irish and British copies of the Treaty document. The exhibition locatesthe Treaty negotiations in the political context of the Irish revolution beginning with the exploratorytalks betweenEacuteamon de Valera and David Lloyd George during the summer of , itdetailsthe work of the Irish plenipotentiaries and their secretariat, by presenting the documentary record that they left behind.  The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,. A crowdfunding page has brought in poundK so far and Ballinderry are aiming to help raise the remainder. On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Steelstown - Donaghmoyne -                                  googletag.cmd.push  Steelstown overcame a three-point half-time deficit to race to a -point victory in their Ulster Championship quarter-final tie against Donaghmoyne at Celtic Park. Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Steelstown - Donaghmoyne -                                  googletag.cmd.push  Steelstown overcame a three-point half-time deficit to race to a -point victory in their Ulster Championship quarter-final tie against Donaghmoyne at Celtic Park. Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Spring: Sunday, The Horror Channel @ pm A disastrous personal le has Evan in a tizzy so he does a legger from the United States to Italy and its here he meets an unusual woman called Louise and a dalliance with her makes his existence back in America look rather normal. A film you want to watch knowing as little about it as possible. Its fun, atmospheric and it will lurk in your head for a while. The fact that its on the horror channel will clue you in. Lou Taylor Pucci andNadia Hilker work well together. Last Orders: Sunday, Film @ pm Jack has passed away and his friends are in mourning. He went out with a smile and one final wish - that his friends get together once more to reminisce and scatter his ashes over the beach he loved so well. An elegant, touching and humane look at the pleasures and hardships of lelong friendships told wonderfully by director Fred Schepisi and a stunner of a cast that includes Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Ray Winston, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay. Brighton Rock: Monday, Talking PicturesTV@ pm Pinkys the leader of a gang in pre-war Brighton. Hes a nasty piece of work and a run-in with a journalist causes big problems for him and for a naive young waitress named Rose whos witness to what he has done. This  adaption of Graham Greens celebrated novel is still a tense, nerve wracking and affecting watch  years later. A baby faced Richard Attenborough does memorable work in the lead role. Topsy Turvy: Monday, Film @ .pm Gilbert and Sullivan. A partnership for the ages. The men behind so many famous operas of the th century. Their work didnt always come easy to them though and Topsy Turvy gives us a peek behind their stage curtains. Mike Leighs  musical drama might be almost  hours long but its very entertaining and satisfying and in the company of actors like Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, Lesley Manville and Shirley Henderson the time flies Farming: Tuesday, Channel  @ .am A young Nigerian boy is sent by his family to England in the s to be raised in a white household. It was a practice known as farming, an attempt to give poor African children a better chance at le. It left some of them with a very confused look at their own racial identity. Based on directorAdewale Akinnuoye-Agbajes own le, its a raw and disturbing coming of age story and a damning indictment of the British governments warped policies. Damson Idris is an excellent lead. Tully: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Marlos struggling. Three kids are taking their toll on her and her marriage. A nanny is hired. An unusual nanny named Tully. A strange bond forms between the two women. Tully comes from the pen of Diablo Cody so its no surprise that it delves into myriad aspects of womanhood rarely seen on screen and that paired with fine turns from Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis makes it really worth a watch Catch And Release: Wednesday, Great! Movies @ .am On the day she was supposed to get married Gray finds herself at the funeral of the man she loved. She has no money and nowhere to live and has to move in with his room mates and soon finds out she didnt know him as well as she thought. This  romcom is enjoyableyou can zone out Kevin Smith as one of the room mates. Jenner Garner and Timothy Olyphant do good enough work together to help you ignore the eejit in the corner. Free State Of Jones: Wednesday, BBC two @ .pm Alienated by the confederation, a soldier deserts his post during the American civil war and together with farmers and freed slaves creates a new state. Things do not go smoothly. Gary Rosss  film is a vivid recreation of an era of American history that rarely gets mentioned. Its as brutal and ugly as youd expect but superb acting from Matthew McConnaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw  Mahershala Ali eases the pain. Another Year: Thursday, Channel  @ am Gerri and Tom are living a quiet, contented le and looking forward to the freedom that comes with retirement but their orced and unhappy friend Mary is becoming an increasingly large presence in their lives. The second Mike Leigh film of the week is too no big surprise another cracker, a deep e into the minutiae of everyday lives and loves that doesnt need fake drama to make its point. Ruth Sheen, Jim Broadbent and Lesley Manville are all impeccable. The Manchurian Candidate: Thursday, BBC @ pm Prisoners of warfrom capture in the Korean War to America. But all is not well. To say anymore might spoil a magnicent piece of neo-noir. A truly suspenseful film, intelligent, inventive, paranoid, complex and deeply layered. Fabulous acting abounds. Frank Sinatra gives one of his best performances but the star of the show is Angela Lansbury. Her character is quite the creation, you wont be able to look away from her. Lawman: Friday, TG @ .pm A marshal arrives into a town to arrest the troublemakers who caused the death of an old man in his town. The townsfolk arent going to make things easy for him though. A hoary old revenge story is the basis of this blistering western and its one that effortlessly bridges the gap between the old fashioned westerns of the s and the dark and violent ones of the s. Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan and Robert Duvall, all old hands at this genre, are all in fine form here. Wild Nights With Emily: Friday, Film @ .pm Not much is known about the personal le of Emily Dickinson, the th century American poet. She was long considered an eccentric loner by her neighbours inMassachusetts but Madeleine Olneks  romcom tells us a dferent version of her story. A surprisingly touching and warm look at how secrets are kept and how legends are created powered by strong turns from Molly Shannon, Amy Seimetz and Susan Zeigler. The Leisure Seeker: Friday RTEacute One @ .pm The Leisure Seeker is the name of Ella and Johns RV and it becomes their home when they decide to drive from Boston to Key West in an attempt to revisit older, better times. A poignant watch that doesnt skimp on the realities of growing old while at the same time shows us a type of love and understanding that only exists after decades of being together. Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland work very well together as the leads.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13260721.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

It is our job to question and to debate and to argue issues out, and given the fundamentally dferent nature of this proposal from that which went before in terms of combating the threat of Covid-, a threat that we all recognise, a threat that we all want to see tackled, I think it is essential that we, the members of this Assembly, whether we’re for them or against them, we should be allowed the opportunity to debate this out and to have the arguments thrashed out here on the floor of the House.“I recognise that the Minister for Health has a very dficult job, and is facing a very dficult time over the coming months, but it is our job to support the minister when he is right but also to question, and to debate and to tease out the evidence, and that’s why I am very disappointed that I don’t see any reference in the business diary to such a debate taking place. It absolutely should take place.”A department of health spokesperson said: “The regulations are currently being scrutinised by the Examiner for Statutory Rules.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him.

Why not name it after yourself, your business, or a loved one \"Oryou really want, you can call our stadium The my mate Dave is a k**b Arena - knock yourself out!\"The lucky competition winner was named as Katie Louise Williams - the girlfriend of the clubs star striker Thomas Walters.Beautician Katie decided to rename Frampton Lane after her pet dog Moomin and chose the title Prince Moomins Palace.Ms Williams, , is planning to take four-year-old Moomin down to the next match to show him around his own stadium.She said: \"Im sure he will be very excited. We cant wait to take him.\"Ive been following the team for years and it was great to win the prize. Moomins name will be known to everyone around her now.\"The club confirmed Ms Williams - who is also the long-term partner of star striker Thomas Walters - won the prize.The club said: \"The stadium was named after her dog Moomin, who we are reliably informed is treated like a Prince.\"The competition raised vital funds in the quest for the club achieving a FAW Tier  License, with proceeds raised going towards much needed ground improvements such as floodlights.\"Reaction from fans has been positive, although much confusion on the stands last Saturday as to whether were still the Windmill Army or now the Moomin Army.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But what is certainly true is that we had a lot of people rushing to get out of Afghanistan for all sorts of reasons.Mr Marshall also alleged that colleagues lacked knowledge of Afghanistan and that junior officials were ldquoscared by being asked to make hundreds of le-and-death decisions about which they knew nothing.ldquoDesperate and urgent emails, including those with titles such as ldquoPlease save my children, were also being opened but not actioned, he said.ldquoI believe the purpose of this system was to allow the Prime Minister and the then foreign secretary to inform MPs that there were no unread emails, Mr Marshall wrote.He also claimed that at one point he was the only person monitoring an inbox where pleas for help were directed.Foreign Office officials and Britainrsquos ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, are due to give evidence to the select committee on Tuesday afternoon..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Dominic Raab defends Kabul airlts after whistleblower us damning claims article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
