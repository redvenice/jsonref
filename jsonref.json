By this point in the month the number is lower than hoped for.\u0027She added that the tussle between the warm air from the South and the wet weather in the West - which will bring rain to most places on Sunday - will finally be won by the continental influence on Monday.Ms Kent said temperatures in the south-east could hit 59F (15C) or 61F (16C) at the start of the working week.She said: \u0027By Tuesday across London we could see 18C (64F), maybe 19C (66F). By Wednesday, there\u0027s still going to be some patchy rain in parts of the north-west but England and Wales will have this continental air coming in.\u0027So, dry weather for them, plenty of sunshine again. Temperatures on Wednesday will again be highest in the South East. London could see between 20C and 23C.             \u0027And in fact, going further north, places like York could see 18C to 20c. And, even for Glasgow, it could be 17C or 18C on Wednesday.\u0027Ms Kent said: \u0027The trend into the end of the week is to continue this feed of warmer continental air across England and Wales. \u0027Those frontal systems are always trying to battle into the north-west, so it could be cloudier there with some more mixed weather at times.\u0027But, by the end of the week, in the that far south-eastern corner we could see temperatures into the low to mid-20s.\u0027Ms Kent said that these temperatures will be above the average for mid April. She said London will normally expect to see levels of 55F (13C) to 57F (14C) at this time of year with an average of 54F (12C) to 55F (13C) normal for southern England.The Met Office said Saturday is likely to be the best day of the coming weekend, with temperatures reaching the mid to high teens in some places.But Sunday will see rain at times across much of Britain as the country braces itself for the sun to come. European forecasters are predicting temperatures around the 70F (21C) mark for Malaga, Rome and Athens next week."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/04/09/4ACF475B00000578-0-image-m-39_1522830633728.jpg","title":"Lawyer worshipped father 75 realised sleeping au pair 28","story":"    Paul David was aged 70 when he married Jobeth Daguio (both are pictured at their wedding) to the outrage of his daughter A millionaire lawyer is locked in a legal battle with her elderly father over her dead mother\u0027s assets after she found the pensioner was sleeping with his daughter\u0027s au-pair.City solicitor Audra Wamsteker, 49, had enjoyed a \u0027close bond\u0027 with father Paul David, \u0027promised to look after him until his dying day\u0027 and \u0027thought of him like a god\u0027, a court was told. But that was before she discovered the 75-year-old had been sleeping with her au-pair since she was 28, branding the relationship with the nanny to her two children \u0027unthinkably repugnant\u0027.The pensioner was 70 when he married \u0027live-in nanny\u0027 Jobeth Daguio, who was aged 28 at the time, five years after the death of Mrs Wamsteker\u0027s mother. They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her  nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him. I don’t deny it, I don’t like him.\u0027I realised what he was when he married my daughter in 2004. She’s got a very greedy husband,\u0027 he told the judge.Alvin David, Mrs Wamsteker’s brother and Mr David’s son, who lives in New Maldon with his family, outside court valued the property, jewellery and money claims being brought by his father against his sister at around £1m. The hearing continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/08/04D7E4AB000007D0-0-image-m-5_1523518559531.jpg","title":"Horrific moment female worker","story":"\u0027Guardian angel\u0027: Alexander Vysotsky is being hailed as a hero in Russia after he stepped in to save 28-year-old Ekaterina, right, from an \u0027attempted rape\u0027 The footage shows the victim bravely resisting, backing away towards the door and even grabbing the blade of the knife.He is seen forcing her  to the ground and pulling at her skirt. We\u0027ve got a dossier too!

Fortunately the guides had drilled it into our heads that if anything happens, don\u0027t run, don\u0027t run!\u0027After about an hour-and-a-half we came out of forest and looked up and about 100 metres away saw an elephant at the top of a little hill. \u0027We stopped immediately admired it and then suddenly it charged us.\u0027Mr Larsen continued: \u0027Dean our lead guide said, \u0027Don\u0027t move!\u0027, so we stood there frozen in terror as the elephant charged down the hill at us.\u0027 I\u0027m a pretty calm person.

He put his arm up and yelled \u0027Whoooa!\u0027 and about 10 metres away the elephant stopped dead in its tracks. \u0027It was unbelievable. It looked like something out of a cartoon. His front feet dug into the ground in a cloud of dust. I could not believe what I was seeing.\u0027With his right arm raised Dean was loudly commanding the elephant and it backed off. It was surreal.

You could see it was angry and meant business.\u0027After the third time the elephant moved off and all I could think of then was get us out of here.\u0027I watched it, relieved, and thought I looked like a child stomping off because Dean hadn\u0027t let it get its own way. \u0027It was flapping its ears and throwing sand over its back.

There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

It was my daughter who suggested I sign her up to a modelling agency. She’s done a variety of campaigns for brands such as Cath Kidston, Sainbury’s and McDonald’s. Photographers tell us that her contrasting markings make her very attractive: she’s not too black and not too white.The Cath Kidston shoot was particularly crazy because it involved more than 30 dogs recreating a scene from 101 Dalmations to promote a range of black and white clothes. Funnily enough, Roo’s grandmother actually starred as one of the 101 dogs in the 1996 version of the film.Roo took it all in her stride and we even bumped into her brother, which was a rather sweet moment.We don’t treat her as any kind of superstar: she’s simply our family pet who we treat occasionally to the odd grooming session at the vet.

I was appearing in panto with him and it was around the time that Pudsey the dog had won Britain’s Got Talent. Shane thought it would be funny to ‘do a Pudsey’ and get Archie to perform ‘tricks’ with him. Shane would then swap him for a toy dog and pretend that Archie was flying across the stage.

He did a huge campaign for the pet charity PDSA last Christmas and his face was plastered all over the Tube and railway stations, and he was on television, too.We get around six jobs a year and every time we are booked for a shoot I ask if the client wants his fur long or short. Some people like them to look a bit fluffier.We give him a bath before each shoot, which he enjoys, and use a lovely coconut shampoo on him so his fur comes out ice-white.Once, when we did a shoot for Boden, we had to travel to London in the pouring rain and arrived with Archie looking like a drowned rat. The styling team thought it was hilarious that he sat there, quite happily, while I used a hairdryer on him and he fluffed up in no time.Terriers are often quite excitable but Archie’s a professional and he’ll often fall asleep while waiting to be called. I keep bits of chicken with me to encourage him to behave.If I use the word ‘Walk’, he will tilt his head in a very cute way. Sometimes he’s booked for jobs simply for that tilt of the head.  \u0027It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star.

He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’. There are not many red poodles in the UK, particularly in this apricot shade, so it’s no wonder he feels special.He’s a stud dog from the Czech Republic and originally belonged to my friend. One of her other poodles didn’t get on with Edward, so I asked if I could have him. He’s loving, intelligent and likes to be the centre of attention.Someone at ITV needed a red poodle for a show and got in touch after seeing Edward’s picture on Instagram. I then contacted the Urban Paws agency.          Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’Edward loved modelling from the very start. He’s appeared in various fashion campaigns, but the most high-profile is Stella McCartney.It was the Chinese Year of the Dog and her team wanted beautiful dogs to model her clothes. I’d never dressed Edward up in any outfits, but I said we’d give it a go.Edward couldn’t get enough of the fuss and attention. At one stage, he had two stylists preening and primping him and was wearing a gold dress that was easily worth more than £1,000.Then something caught his eye and he started racing around the studio. My heart stopped. I thought he’d ruin the dress — but he soon calmed down and we got some gorgeous shots.Once a week, I will shampoo and condition him, then dry him and make sure there are no knots. It takes around 45 minutes each time and he loves being brushed. He stands still like a statue.The money he earns varies, but usually it’s around £400 a day. I’m not allowed to say how much we were paid for the Stella job but I used £200 of it to treat Edward to a teeth-cleaning session at the vet.  Edward is a four-year-old miniature ‘red’ poodle.

To keep him in one place, I had to hide behind the sofa, holding my hand out and saying: ‘Stay, Humphrey, stay.’ Thankfully, he did.At one point, he had to follow the model to the door when the doorbell rang. I didn’t think he’d do it, but he did — and got a round of applause from the team.Dogs are supposed to know their place, but now that he’s a high-end fashion model, I think Humphrey may get ideas above his station.Archie, Roo and Iraida provided by PetLondon – www.petlondonmodels.com   \u0027Ever since Humphrey was a puppy we’ve been stopped in the street by strangers asking if they can take his photograph.

This means that immigration accounts for 21 per cent of the population-related increase on house prices.Rises in average incomes were responsible for a 150 per cent increase in house prices.The Ministry of Housing was forced to publish the figures to back up its claim that immigration had driven up house prices after the UK statistics watchdog demanded to see its modelling.

At the same time you can’t just airbrush the costs and the impact it has on housing.’But Mr Portes, a professor of economics at King’s College London, said the model was not reliable. He added: ‘This is worse than amateurback of envelope – I’m genuinely shocked the ministry would publish this.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/00/44F5977900000578-0-image-m-20_1523662699341.jpg","title":"NINE Cabinet ministers making 10 000 year renting properties","story":"    Jeremy Hunt was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interestsNine cabinet ministers including Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are making a fortune renting out properties, it was revealed. The Secretary of State for Housing, Sajid Javid, is also among the group of politicians raking in more than £10,000 from flats and houses they own. It comes after Mr Hunt failed to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he later rented out.  He was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interests. A spokesman for No 10 said: \u0027Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the Ministerial Code. We consider the matter closed.\u0027Mr Hunt amended the register to show he has half a share of a holiday home in Italy and half a share in an office building in Hammersmith, West London, according to The Guardian. They are in addition to the seven apartments he acquired recently in Southampton. Other ministers who are landlords are Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who rents two properties. Prime Minister Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who both live in Downing Street, both rent out the Central London homes. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, International Trade Minister Liam Fox, the Minister without portfolio Brandon Lewis and the Secretary of State for Wales also rent out properties.           Prime Minister Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who both live in Downing Street, both rent out the Central London homesJeremy Hunt established Mare Pond Properties Ltd with his wife, Lucia Guo, and has purchased seven flats in the £40m Alexandra Wharf development.Flats in the Southampton waterfront go for £450,000 - £1m. But when Mr Hunt filed the registration documents in September last year, only his wife was named which constituted a breach of regulations.   Secretary of State for Housing Sajid Javid (right) and Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairnes (left) both rent out propertiesJeremy Hunt is referred to the standards commissioner and...A ten-day stay in hospital can make elderly patients age a...Share this articleBrandon Lewis, the Minister without Portfolio (left) and International Trade Minister Liam Fox (right) also rent out propertiesIt was also a breach of the Companies Act, which requires anyone with mroe than 25 per cent control of a firm to be declared as a \u0027person with significant control\u0027. A spokesman said that Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, had received a complaint about Mr Hunt yesterday and would consider it next week. MPs with a holding larger than 15 per cent are required to register them within 28 days. Mr Hunt failed to register his for five months - which he attributed to an honest error by his accountant.   Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson (left) and Transport Secretary Chris Graying rent out properties But Labour said the Health Secretary\u0027s actions were a \u0027serious breach\u0027, and shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett added: \u0027This is simply unacceptable and especially so given the secretary of state\u0027s position at the heart of Theresa May\u0027s Government.\u0027The flat, located in an luxury block, was developed by Nicholas James Group, which has donated more than £50,000 to Mr Hunt\u0027s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, largely in complimentary venue hire. The Health Secretary and Mr Roach were pictured together in 2011 at the launch of a £60m hotel, which was partly developed by Roach\u0027s company in Guildford. A spokeswoman for Hunt said: \u0027Jeremy\u0027s accountant made an error in the Companies House fi ling, which was a genuine oversight.

This image made from video shows a fighter jet taking off from Akrotiri military British Royal Air Force Base, Cyprus, Saturday          The Ministry of Defence confirmed they fired Storm Shadow cruise missiles at a military facility – a former missile base – some fifteen miles west of HomsThe attack was focused on regime facilities linked to the production and use of chemical weapons. Declaring his support, French President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the United States and Britain have launched a military operation against the Syrian government\u0027s \u0027clandestine chemical arsenal.\u0027Macron said in a statement on Saturday that France\u0027s \u0027red line has been crossed\u0027 after a suspected chemical attack last week in the Syrian town of Douma.He says there is \u0027no doubt\u0027 that the Syrian government is responsible.          Smoke rises after airstrikes targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, Syria          British Royal Air Force (RAF) Akrotiri base, near Limassol, CyprusMacron added the operation is limited to Syria\u0027s abilities to produce chemical weapons, and would not give details about what equipment is involved in the operation or what sites it is targeting.   Despite the ferocity of the Allied strikes, Syrian air defences claim to have shot down 13 missiles fired in the attack, Syrian state TV said. The missiles had been shot down in the Kiswah area south of Damascus.Shortly after the strike, the MOD released a statement, stating: \u0027The UK element of the carefully coordinated joint action was contributed by four Royal Air Force Tornado GR4s. \u0027They launched Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility – a former missile base – some fifteen miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to keep chemical weapon precursors stockpiled in breach of Syria\u0027s obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. \u0027Very careful scientific analysis was applied to determine where best to target the Storm Shadows to maximise the destruction of the stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area. The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk.          French President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the United States and Britain have launched a military operation against the Syrian government\u0027s \u0027clandestine chemical arsenal\u0027\u0027Detailed analysis of the effectiveness of the strike is currently underway, but initial indications are that the precision of the Storm Shadow weapons and meticulous target planning have resulted in a successful attack.\u0027Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \u0027The reprehensible use of chemical weapons in Douma is further evidence of the Syrian regime\u0027s appalling cruelty against its own people. \u0027We will not stand by whilst innocent civilians, including women and children, are killed and made to suffer.\u0027The international community has responded decisively with legal and proportionate military force. Let these united actions send a clear message to the regime – the use of chemical weapons is categorically unacceptable and you will be held to account.\u0027    US Defense Secretary James Mattis says the U.S. and its allies have taken ‘decisive action’ against Syrian chemical weapons infrastructure.Mattis briefed reporters at the Pentagon Friday an hour after President Donald Trump announced the strike.Mattis said the United States, along with France and the United Kingdom, struck because Syrian President Bashar Assad ‘did not get the message’ when the U.S. launched airstrikes after a chemical attack in 2017.The defense secretary said Friday\u0027s strikes have ‘sent a clear message’ to Assad and his ‘murderous lieutenants.’Mattis said the strikes are ‘directed at the Syrian regime’ and they have ‘gone to great lengths to avoid civilians and foreign casualties.’Mattis said the U.S. has no reports of suffering any losses during the initial airstrikes on Syria Friday. Mattis said ‘right now this is a one-time shot’ but is not ruling out further attacks. President Donald Trump had said earlier that the campaign against the regime of Bashar Assad could be \u0027sustained.’The defense secretary says the airstrikes were launched against several sites that he says helped provide Assad\u0027s ability to create chemical weapons.Mattis said he is ‘absolutely confident’ that Syrian President Bashar Assad is behind the alleged chemical attack on his people that the U.S. and allies retaliated against Friday night.He says the U.S. is ‘very much aware of one of the chemical agents used.’ And he says there may have been a second.        Yesterday details emerged of a Cabinet meeting the PM held on Thursday where she won the backing of her ministers to proceed without a parliamentary vote.She told Cabinet: ‘Since 1918 we have worked to uphold the international norm that chemical weapons are abhorrent and must never be used. In recent years that international norm has been eroded and that should be a matter of deep concern to us all. The use of chemical weapons should not go unchallenged.’The Prime Minister said Britain had to act in order to restore that norm, because the weapons inflict human misery. Downing Street sources said she made the point that these weapons had been used a number of times in Syria – and also in Salisbury.          \u0027These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster instead,\u0027 Trump said referring to Assad (pictured)The need to restore international norms was shared by the whole Cabinet, Downing Street sources said. They said: ‘Cabinet have been impressed that from the off she has been very robust and very clear. She was the most hawkish.’Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, held a press conference at his residence accusing Britain of peddling myths about Russia’s activities.At one point he compared allegations that the Syrian government had gassed its own people to Tony Blair’s claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.He also suggested the alleged use of chemical weapons was a hoax and may have been used to discredit Assad. The Russian embassy in the UK said: ‘Military strikes may be used to cover up all the evidence, or lack thereof, on the ground.’Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the military had ‘proof that testifies to the direct participation of Britain in the organising of this provocation in eastern Ghouta’.          Theresa May\u0027s statement in full \u0027This evening I have authorised British armed forces to conduct co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian Regime\u0027s chemical weapons capability and deter their use.\u0027We are acting together with our American and French allies.\u0027In Douma, last Saturday a chemical weapons attack killed up to 75 people, including young children, in circumstances of pure horror.\u0027The fact of this attack should surprise no-one.\u0027The Syrian Regime has a history of using chemical weapons against its own people in the most cruel and abhorrent way.\u0027And a significant body of information including intelligence indicates the Syrian Regime is responsible for this latest attack.\u0027This persistent pattern of behaviour must be stopped – not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons.\u0027We have sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to achieve this.\u0027But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted. Even this week the Russians vetoed a Resolution at the UN Security Council which would have established an independent investigation into the Douma attack.\u0027So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Regime.\u0027This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.\u0027It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties.\u0027And while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian Regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity.\u0027At this time, my thoughts are with our brave British servicemen and women – and our French and American partners – who are carrying out their duty with the greatest professionalism.\u0027The speed with which we are acting is essential in co-operating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations.\u0027This is the first time as Prime Minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat – and it is not a decision I have taken lightly.\u0027I have done so because I judge this action to be in Britain\u0027s national interest.\u0027We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.\u0027We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.\u0027History teaches us that the international community must defend the global rules and standards that keep us all safe.\u0027That is what our country has always done. And what we will continue to do. \u0027                                                          President Trump\u0027s Friday night address My fellow Americans: a short time ago I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both. Tonight I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of the Syrian air force.Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians, this time in the town of Douma near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by the very terrible regime. the evil and despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster, instead. Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power -- military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran and to Russia I ask, what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants and murderous dictators. In 2013 President Putin and his government promised the world they would guarantee the elimination of Syria\u0027s chemical weapons. Assad\u0027s recent attack and today\u0027s response are the direct result of Russia\u0027s failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully some day we\u0027ll get along with Russia and maybe even Uran, but maybe not. I will say this, the United States has a lot to offer with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria the United States with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS.America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria. Under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home and great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It\u0027s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of World War I, more than 1 million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly specter return. So today, the nations of Britain, France and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God there guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace. And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America. Thank you, and good night. Thank you. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/01/4B1F781C00000578-0-image-a-2_1523665988465.jpg","title":"Family 14 living four bedroom house mother claims evicted","story":"    Patricia Newman, 33, and her six children have moved into her mother\u0027s home - already occupied by seven other members of her familyDorothy, of Mersey Road in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, also shares her home with her two adult sons and their collective four children, over whom she has guardianship.The grandmother-of-ten said: \u0027Patricia and the children really need rehousing - the children need their own home with their mother.\u0027I have guardianship of four kids and it is hard work having that many children here.\u0027I am out looking after my mother who is seriously ill with heart problems among other illnesses.

Gavin Cox, left, who was injured during an illusion by David Copperfield at the MGM Grand, is overcome with emotion during opening statementsAttorneys on Friday described how Cox sat on a platform on stage and later followed a route that took him through hallways and an outdoor area near a door that would have led him back inside.

It makes sense: more than four in five Australians live within easy walking or driving distance of the sea. As writer Anna Funder recently said of those who call the driest continent on Earth home: “We cling to the edge of the continent, and we swim from a very early age.”Growing up, I hated swimming – which was awful, because I didn’t just grow up in Australia, I grew up in Queensland: the sun-saturated state that gifted us Olympic gods like Kieran Perkins, Susie O’Neill, Grant Hackett and Stephanie Rice, a state where the main trade seemed to be sugar, coal and championship swimmers.You weren’t just expected to know how to swim you were expected to be good at it, too.My parents were Cantonese migrants from Hong Kong who, in the 1970s, moved to Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, home to some of the country’s most beautiful beaches. It still strikes me as a slightly baffling decision, given neither of them could swim. Water compelled and terrified them and their five Australian-born kids.While other people saw stunning coastlines, we just saw a picturesque way to die. Rips could kill you, people said. Sharks could kill you. Skin cancer could kill you. Weirdly, it was always white people who told us these things, the same white people who seemed to keep going to the beach. Were we missing something? Did they want to die?A safer option was the public pool. Years of TV safety campaigns had convinced Mum we needed to know how to swim, because she sure as hell couldn’t save us if we were drowning. Throughout summer, we’d wail as Mum drove us to the nearest suburban leisure centre for lessons. I suspect we dreaded those lessons as much as our instructors dreaded teaching us, those hopeless Asian kids spluttering with anxiety inside the enclosed training pool, those stinking hothouses of chemicals, piss and wet togs (or cossies, or bathers, or swimmers – depending on your state).After the nightmare was over, we’d be sedated with a treat – a Redskin (Australians veer towards racism even with our confectionary), an ice block or a packet of frogs – before falling asleep in the stuffy Ford Cortina, hair matted to our temples, seat belts twisted into our skin and fingers dusted orange from the Twisties we stole from each other.The horror didn’t end there. At school, not only were swimming lessons mandatory, carnivals were too – annual, school-run swim meets, ostensibly fun but deeply competitive. We even had togs in school colours that we had to buy from the uniform shop.During the lessons, I’d watch fit white kids e in and carve through water with graceful limbs that seemed custom-built for the job. Meanwhile, in Lane 1 or 6 – where I could still hold onto the wall – I’d windmill uselessly, my hands banging into the water like saucepans. There was a direct, inverse correlation between the amount of splashing I made and the distance I travelled. At swimming carnivals, all the outcasts were bunched together: the ethnic kid with no body fat (me) pale kids with lots of body fat. We had to swim in an event – any event – so we’d do the novelty race, paddling together on inflatable rafts, damp with chlorine and shame, as everyone cheered and jeered us on. But then, weirdly, I fell in love with swimming. I left home for university, moved to Brisbane and into a rambling architectural mess of a shared house. Its design was … incorrect. It attracted the heat in summer, then trapped it. During heatwaves, my flatmates and I would emerge from our rooms having barely slept and looking boiled. I took refuge from the heat at the Olympic-sized council pool at the bottom of our hill. It didn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it was pure and clean, with a panoramic view of the city skyline. I didn’t have proper togs so I swam in black boxer briefs, hoping no one would notice. After a while, I tried swimming laps.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Alan, the pool manager, took pity on me. “Instead of bashing into the water with your arms like that,” he said, “stretch out like this and twist your entire torso. Instead of exhaling like that, hum and you won’t lose your breath so quickly.” It was homework, and I’d always liked homework. Slowly, I got faster.By the time I moved to Sydney, I owned proper Speedos, goggles and a kickboard. I signed myself up for a 1km charity ocean swim. From some angles it seemed as though I had pecs. Who was this person?I’ve been helped by the fact Sydney has – hands down – the best lap pools in the world. Every inner-city public pool is a wonder in some way. My local, the Prince Alfred Park Pool, is an award-winning architectural miracle built into a hill – like a swimming oasis for hobbits. It’s impossible to take a bad photo of North Sydney Olympic Pool, where the reward for finishing laps is endless Instagram-ready photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which towers above the pool like a CGI hallucination. On the other side of the harbour, Andrew “Boy” Charlton Pool is plonked right in the middle of the botanical gardens, decked out like a resort and boasting so many toned men in Speedos, it feels like you’re in the video for Kylie Minogue’s Slow.Even Sydney’s indoor pools – which I usually avoid because of the claustrophobic chlorine pong – are impressive. Ultimo’s dreamy, wave-walled Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (the first Sydney pool I ever swam in) is a Harry Seidler original, a modernist wave of concrete and steel rising from Darling Harbour. In the Cook + Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are giant paintings by the Archibald winner Wendy Sharpe, making it one of the few places where you can do laps in an art gallery.For a spiritual experience, it’s all about the ocean baths. On good days, you can swim alongside schools of fish in Wylie’s Baths in Coogee. There’s a reason people rave about Bondi Icebergs, with its sauna overlooking the violent churn of the surf below. And though I’ll never get to visit, I love the idea of Coogee’s McIver’s Ladies Baths, the last remaining women’s-only seawater pool in Australia. Apparently it’s particularly popular with nuns, Muslim women and lesbians I like thinking about the unexpected friendships that have been made there.Is it too far to say swimming is the Australian version of baptism? To me, these places feel sacred to swim in them veers towards sacrament. When I get writer’s block, I swim. When I need space, I swim. When I need company, I swim. When I’m depressed, I swim. When I’m happy, I swim.Last Christmas, my siblings and I – all comically terrible swimmers as kids – laughed at the fact that our eldest sister was now a regular surfer. The remaining four of us now swim regularly in lap pools. Those Asian kids at school, so bad at swimming carnivals that they were constantly disqualified? Well, some of them grew up and now swim  kilometres for leisure. It shouldn’t be surprising – we’re also Australian, after all.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

The\u0026nbspburglar’s friends and relatives have made a little shrine from flowers and balloons above the pavement where he collapsed and died. Residents have repeatedly removed and trampled it. The police have appealed for calm and respect on both sides, and been roundly abused for it. That’s because this is a essentially religious skirmish, one in which symbolism brings up profound questions about the worth of an apparently worthless life. Flower power was not meant to work like this.Henry Vincent was a career criminal who preyed on old people, sometimes using force. On 4 April he was stabbed in the kitchen of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks, who found him there going equipped with a screwdriver. An accomplice fled and is still wanted by the police. Osborn-Brooks will not be charged and public sentiment, as well as the law, is overwhelmingly on his side. Since Vincent’s death many accounts have surfaced of his earlier crimes. Yet he left a family and friends. There are those who mourn him, and they come from a Traveller community where ostentatious public displays of grief and respect are essential funeral rites.Nothing more clearly demonstrates your position\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspsociety than your treatment after death. Today this is a matter of respect, like granting Stephen\u0026nbspHawking a grave in Westminster Abbey. But historically it has often been the opposite. Denying recognition to a corpse was a way of demonstrating exclusion. People who took their own lives were denied Christian burial the corpse of Oliver Cromwell was dug up when the monarchy was restored so that it could be mutilated and publicly displayed in the Iliad, Achilles drags the naked corpse of Hector behind his chariot around the walls of Troy until old king Priam comes to beg for the corpse of his son to give it a decent burial.It would be an exaggeration to say that the supporters of Osborn-Brooks want these things done to the corpse of Henry Vincent, but they want him away, they want him forgotten, and they want his memory out of their neighbourhood. Funerals and graves are ways of manipulating the sacred, but they also make territorial claims. “There is some corner of a foreign field,” wrote Rupert Brooke, foreseeing his own unglamorous death from dysentery, “that is forever England.”To place a memorial to Vincent on the spot where he died suggests that he had a right to be there, as well as a\u0026nbspright to live, and this is something that seems\u0026nbspviscerally\u0026nbspwrong to anyone who felt threatened by\u0026nbspthe activities of his gang.For both sides, then, this unassuming wooden fence has become a shrine. It is a symbol whose meaning can neither be avoided nor agreed. To one side it is a tribute to the other, a deliberate provocation. This row is playing on the roots of religion.The anthropologist Scott Atran talks about sacred values as being those symbols which seem so important that people are prepared to die or kill for them. This is related to the claim of one of the founders of modern sociology, Émile Durkheim, that soldiers in wartime fight, quite literally, for their flag. The thing about sacred objects, Atran says, is that they cannot be exchanged for worldly advantages. Conflicts over shrines, or sacred objects, can only be settled when both sides acknowledge the symbolic claims of the other.In that light, it is obvious how this conflict might have been resolved: by the relatives of Henry Vincent acknowledging the pain and distress he had caused, and apologising for it before they mourned his good qualities. What actually happened was almost the opposite. Possibly angered by widely reported comments from earlier victims that the dead man had\u0026nbspbeen no loss to the world, supporters of Vincent mocked Osborn-Brooks and rejoiced on social media at\u0026nbspthe way that he has been driven from his home by the\u0026nbsppressure and media attention. It’s tempting to ask who needs religion when you’ve got social media to do\u0026nbspthe work of stirring hatred.But in fact this is a moment when only some kind of\u0026nbspsymbolic, religious ceremony could possibly settle the dispute. Legally, a public street is public. The family and friends of Henry Vincent have a perfect right to be there, just as he did. But emotionally it’s a neighbourhood. The police cannot resolve the dispute by keeping one side or the other away. They cannot enforce one vision over another, nor should they. But neither is there any longer any recognised religious authority which could reconcile these two visions.Perhaps the funeral of Henry Vincent will\u0026nbspoffer a remembrance of his life reflecting his family’s conviction that he did not deserve to die. Perhaps that is\u0026nbspthe underlying message of every funeral:\u0026nbspthat the dead do not deserve to die, however bad their lives. But\u0026nbspno one should be forced to remember them who doesn’t want to.• Andrew Brown writes on religion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ec96ba6d2f37a20014902059cd40681ea3a0b0/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2c0a92cc90ca9ee9a12542e7c954fa9b 1720w","title":"trinidad homphobic laws win case commonwealth","story":"I am a gay Trinidadian. Until three days ago, making that statement could have landed me in prison. Before Thursday, it was a crime for adults of the same gender to have sex. Our “buggery” law imposed 25 years’ imprisonment. All other intimacy between two women or two men risked five years’ imprisonment under the demeaningly named offence of “serious indecency”.Last year I said enough is enough and sued my country to change the law. My legal team, led by Richard Drabble QC, argued that these laws violate the right to privacy, family life, equality before the law and freedom of expression.On Thursday we won the case – and resoundingly so. Mr Justice Rampersad in the high court of Port of Spain, our capital, handed down judgment agreeing that each of these rights was violated. On a rough count, there are about 100,000 LGBTQ+ people in Trinidad and Tobago. Finally, each of us is free from the fear of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment simply for living our lives.Listening to the judgment, I broke down in tears as I realised that I had won, that my country – for the first time – had accepted me for who I am. I can’t describe how it feels to hear a judge say that as a gay man I have an inherent human dignity with which the state must not interfere. His firmness on this point was commendable – laws that criminalise homosexuality, he ruled, are as heinous as those that allowed apartheid, segregation and the Holocaust. I agree.The judge recognised that when human dignity is stripped away, so as to render one characteristic “superior” to another, society goes awry. After the judgment, as I stood outside the Hall of Justice wrapped in a rainbow flag, I had finally been clothed in dignity.This judgment was the culmination of my 30 years of human rights’ activism. I was born in the 1960s, the decade that Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain. Like other former colonies, we inherited Britain’s anti-gay laws. But our Spanish, French and Dutch-speaking neighbours do not criminalise homosexuality, and never did.As a teenager, it was obvious to others that I was gay. The bullying was incessant and cruel. In the 1980s I left Trinidad for London, unable to cope with the daily homophobia. In 1992 I returned home but the persecution had not changed. In 1996 I was forced away again. I came back between 2011 and 2014 to try to progress this issue through engagement and advocacy but the homophobia remained intolerable. In the end, this saga of suffering won me my case. My having to leave – effectively forced into exile – was submitted as evidence to the court of how vile these laws are.Litigation was a last resort for me, so that I could return home. That is all I have ever wanted to do. It has been the most humbling of experiences, with challenges that I could not have imagined. The religious groups who supported the retention of the laws were polite opponents, as much as we disagreed. The shock to me was that those who should most support decriminalisation most disrupted my challenge. My only support from any NGO – in Trinidad, the UK or internationally – was some funding from an HIV-prevention charity.In December 2015 I approached the Human Dignity Trust, a London-based charity whose sole purpose is to bring about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It said it would help. I was overjoyed, but then it dropped me without explanation, blocking my remaining routes to funding in the process. Just as upsetting was how my country’s Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) reacted to my challenge. It submitted a document to court supporting the retention of the criminal laws. At that stage, I almost gave up.I ran my case on a shoestring of around £20,000 over two-and-a-half years. That’s a mere 20p per LGBTQ+ person no longer a criminal. I now hope that my lean model becomes the norm, whereby activists are in control, unbeholden to global organisations that often only profit from our suffering.It was only the support of my legal team that kept me going – Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel in Trinidad, and Peter Laverack in London, who in particular has been my rock, and was the architect of the legal arguments that won the day.At the EOC, it turned out that a junior member of staff submitted the document without authority. The day before the trial, thankfully, it was withdrawn.After the many bumps in the road, it was the rule of law that prevailed. For that, all Trinbagonians can rejoice. My dignity is their dignity is our dignity. The words of my country’s national anthem say that its citizens of every kind “find an equal place”. Now, finally, I have.With the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in London from Monday, I am hopeful that our victory offers pause to the 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries that still criminalise homosexuality. Nine are in the Caribbean.The right to dignity that Trinidad and Tobago’s court recognised in me is universal – in lesbians criminalised in Uganda and Tanzania, and in gay men criminalised in India and Singapore.It is imperative that LGBTQ+ is on the agenda in London. The event offers both a safe space for this discussion and an opportunity for the capital of the former empire that bequeathed us these heinous laws to help rid us of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c20108c284dcb186f1b10457a289aa3705b6e84b/0_63_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f44ad441bdc275d22a69ec0c3de24616 1240w","title":"schools education pupils families home","story":"TV shows recognise how vital home input is to education. So why doesn’t the government do more to support families?This is a tale of two boys. Jack is 15, casually racking up detentions and in danger of flunking his GCSEs. Tharush is the same age, but sits conscientiously doing extra maths on a Friday night while his classmates are out partying. But it’s also, at least in part, a tale of two parenting styles. Jack’s mum seems lovely but works long hours, and can’t face a long row over the homework he doesn’t do when she gets home. Tharush’s mum escaped civil war in Sri Lanka by stowing away in a container for 18 hours, afraid she would die, and is now determined her boy should make the most of chances she didn’t have. For BBC2’s fly-on-the-wall experiment, Living with the Brainy Bunch, Jack moved in with Tharush’s stricter parents while his equally disengaged classmate Hollie M went to live with the school’s head girl and her family, who enjoy challenging each other to name Shakespeare plays over supper.Spoiler alert: after six weeks of early bedtimes, beadily supervised homework and other wholesome activities, both guinea pigs’ scores on a maths GCSE paper improved. Bonus question, for an extra five marks: discuss what, if anything, that proves.Strictly speaking, of course, it wasn’t meant to prove anything but merely to dramatise what decades of rather more rigorous research shows, namely the extraordinarily powerful influence of parental involvement on children’s attainment. It’s debatable how much is nature or nurture, and which precise bits of parenting make a difference. But there’s a broad consensus around the usefulness of things such as reading to small children, setting routines and boundaries, ensuring teenagers get enough sleep, eating dinner together, and showing you take schoolwork seriously.Obviously, that’s infinitely easier if a parent’s own life is comfortable and unstressed you try emulating the Waltons while simultaneously being evicted from a rented flat, or hiding from a violent ex, or even being too exhausted by your newborn to prise the iPad from its older sibling’s hands.But beyond the extremes are plenty of children like Jack and Hollie who aren’t traumatised or on the breadline but hover on the borderline of a GCSE pass or fail, and could be doing better. That’s the territory explored by a new wave of education telly that also includes Channel 4’s Class of Mum and Dad – about a group of parents sent back to primary school – and Indian Summer School, following five struggling British boys packed off to a strict overseas boarding school. All three are a reminder that home environments, and what they mean for expectations of schools, are curiously under-discussed.On the right of politics, any suggestion that teachers can’t be expected both to teach and simultaneously compensate for anything missing at home is rejected as the bigotry of soft expectations. Liberals meanwhile worry about sounding judgmental or snobby, even though self-indulgent parenting transcends class ides: think of the pushy private school parent who can’t believe their little darling’s D-grade might be his own fault for not revising, and blames the teachers instead of pondering his work ethic.But talk to teachers, and you hear about the endless time spent parenting the parents, never mind the kids: breaking up fights between grown adults in the playground, explaining that it’s probably best not to let kids stay up till 3am playing Xbox or instantly take their side in every dispute. We are expecting schools to solve problems created at home while simultaneously cutting the very things – from early intervention projects to children’s mental health services – that might help. If politicians want educational standards to keep rising inexorably that means investing in family life, too.State intervention in parenting has an admittedly chequered history. Sure Start is the standout example of focusing on children’s early development while tacitly recognising how much of that flows from helping parents parent but in some neighbourhoods it was colonised by parents who didn’t need it, and results could be patchy. David Cameron’s troubled families programme was overhyped, underfunded and presented unnecessarily confrontationally by politicians as punishment for “bad” parents, although on the ground it did some decent work in places. The longer school days introduced by inner-city academies, so pupils could do homework in school supervised by teachers, were a practical recognition that for some school is the only relatively quiet, safe place they know, but there’s a limit to how long they can be on the premises.There’s no silver bullet. In some cases it will be about lifting financial stress on families, in others about changing behaviour – including supporting those parents who are doing their best who desperately want to help their kids, but struggle with the legacy of their own schooldays. Class of Mum and Dad was full of them, from the dad who kicked instantly against the rules to the woman who fled a maths test designed for 11-year-olds in tears because she couldn’t do it, and turned out to have been bullied as a child. It left you wondering why routes back into adult education aren’t better linked with schools when wanting to be able to help with your own child’s homework is such a powerful motivator. Could schools become gateways to lifelong learning, offering refresher sessions after hours to parents unfamiliar with the bus-stop method for ision (ask an eight-year-old) or even night classes leading to qualifications?The surprisingly good-natured exchanges between Jack and Hollie’s parents and their host families, and the friendships forged between the kids, hint meanwhile at the importance of peer mentoring. Advice is easier to swallow from someone in the same boat than from an official lecture.But the final step in other cases is parents ourselves taking responsibility for what we do or don’t do: recognising that schools can’t work miracles, that blaming teachers for things beyond their control is unfair and demoralising. It’s time this debate moved off the telly and into real life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51bb3c7bbeeb9686e8c187845226de381ae5058c/447_442_6024_3614/master/6024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74d40fd8cea88f19e524a6c7687ec155 1240w","title":"british museum director hartwig fischer there are no foreigners here the museum is a world country","story":"The German art historian reveals plans for an extensive revamp at Britain’s most visited attraction, but won’t be drawn on calls to return plundered worksHartwig Fischer, who took over the directorship of the British Museum from Neil MacGregor two years ago, has no decoration on the plain blue walls of his office. There are glass-fronted bookshelves. There ia a desk and chairs and two enormous sash windows looking out on to the great forecourt. (Or, more immediately, on to what some staff call the “Bake Off tent” – the ugly temporary structure through which visitors must currently pass for security checks.) But there is nothing to signal Fischer’s taste – nothing like the glimmering wall sculpture by El Anatsui that MacGregor had nothing like the array of Staffordshire pottery that Tristram Hunt displays in his office at the V\u0026ampA no equivalent to the Paula Rego that Maria Balshaw favours in her lair at Tate. There is only a reproduction of a Cycladic figure on the fireplace, a leftover from the MacGregor years, and, on his desk lamp, a tiny figurine of Sai Baba, a spiritual master revered as a saint, which Indian friends gave him.Instead, he says, he prefers to concentrate on the people who come through his doors – and the great treasure house of the museum. But the blankness of his working space radiates through his personal manner: he is warm and friendly, but oddly remote. His employees contrast the charismatic immediacy of MacGregor, who had the disconcerting habit of plonking himself down by random staffers in the canteen and interrogating them about their work, with this more distant figure, who speaks softly and carefully, who glides modestly around the galleries, who is sphinx-like in his statements. But for all that, he is quietly formidable, and has vast ambitions for the museum – plans that will, if they see the light of day, transform the museum for generations to come.Fischer, 56, who came to London after running the state museums in Dresden, is aiming to put the museum, in all its shopworn grandeur, through a major renovation project that will culminate in a complete redisplay of its galleries. That doesn’t sound so remarkable until you begin to absorb the scale of the job. When I joke that it can’t be as big as the Palace of Westminster’s renovation, which will cost at least £3.5bn, he tells me that the museum has more rooms than parliament – 3,000 versus 1,100 – and that the state of the essential services, such as electricity, gas and water are in dire need of repair, just as they are at Westminster. He has in mind something as grand and decisive as the “projet grand” Louvre, which saw the building of IM Pei’s dramatic pyramids and cost between F6bn and F7bn (around £780m at 1993 prices). Or the recent renovation of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which saw the institution closed for a decade and a bill of €375m.Unlike Amsterdam, though, Fischer says: “We cannot close the museum. It’s entirely out of the question.” The British Museum is the most visited attraction in Britain, with 5.9m visitors last year. Work will have to be phased. It will take years. As for even a vague price tag, he is not to be drawn: assessments are still being carried out. And who will pay? Clearly, there will have to be the mother of all fundraising campaigns. But Fischer carefully notes that the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum were renewed “with the support of their governments”. What Fischer hopes to achieve by the end of all this is a display that is more coherent – and more interconnected. That means reshuffling the Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections so that they are not scattered between two floors as they are at present, and also finding ways to show that, as Fischer puts it, “human history was driven and has always been driven by exchange, by cultures communicating”. The interconnectedness he is keen to demonstrate might also be across time: towards the end of our interview we go over to the museum’s big exhibition space, where a stunning show on Rodin and ancient Greek sculpture is being installed. It’s the first exhibition to have been largely developed under his leadership, and its approach – looking at how an artist was shaped by his understanding of the past – might prove a hint at the shape of the programme to come.It’s an intriguing time to be considering the renewal of the British Museum – one of the world’s few so-called “encyclopedic museums” – as Fischer puts it, “a museum of the world for the world”. But Britain is on the brink of Brexit, turning its face away from Europe. When I ask Fischer if he would have taken the job had it been offered on 24 June 2016, he says: “Yes, without any hesitation whatsoever.” This contrasts to the view taken by the late Martin Roth, his predecessor at Dresden, whose resignation from the V\u0026ampA in September 2016 was said to have been hastened by disillusion at the referendum.The museum’s job, Fischer says, is to take the long view, to confront the whole of human history, to understand that Brexit is a moment in the turbulent story of the world. But at the same time: “Everyone who knows me knows I come from a European background and that Europe, as it developed after the catastrophe of the wars is something very important and precious to me. The museum has a lot to offer to help people to contemplate and reflect on what the right decisions should be without taking a direct political stance. It’s there as a space to think, reflect, debate.” It is true that Fischer could hardly be more European. He was raised in Hamburg, studied in Italy and France, and has worked in Switzerland as well as Germany his wife is a psychotherapist in Paris. It’s easy to imagine what his personal views might be, even if for now, they are cloaked in civil service neutrality. He simply says: “Whoever comes in here and crosses the threshold is not a foreigner. There are no foreigners here. This is a world country, this museum. While at the same time we recognise that this is a British creation, to which the cultures of all the world have contributed.”Contributed, yes – but not always willingly. The museum’s collection is inextricably entwined with Britain’s dark imperial past. Increasingly, nations want their objects back: not just the Greeks and the Parthenon sculptures, but others – there is a longstanding claim from Ethiopia, for example, about works of art plundered from Maqdala after its capture by the British in 1868.It’s all very well, I suggest, talking of the museum as an international project, and even as a space where international co-operation between colleagues can continue when formal diplomatic ties are strained. (Fischer made a visit to Iran in December when we meet, he has just returned from Egypt.) But the buck stops for many with the objects themselves, with the fact of possession and ownership. “When you go to see the Parthenon sculptures,” he says, “you can read about the different views, the conflicting views, and we respect different views.” Respecting views is one thing, but keeping the objects is another – that’s the line drawn right there, isn’t it? “It is a line. But what’s been created here is a major contribution to humanity. So while I respect these views, I always say what has been created here, which is open to everybody, creates an extraordinary opportunity to see cultural heritage in a context you have in only a very few places. That is the museum’s major value and it is very precious.”Fischer has come into this environment from the relatively easier circumstances of Germany, where government support for culture, though under recent pressure, is understood as a given, not fought over tooth and nail every step of the way. One of the things he is really passionate about is a music festival he has organised it will see everything from Ligeti and Nono to Japanese temple music performed in the museum’s galleries. “I’ve always worked with musicians in museums,” he says. “When you look at things listening, you look at things differently. The ears make you see more, and the eyes make you hear more.” Ironically, the festival, which is organised in partnership with the Dresden museums, is being paid for by the German foreign ministry. Still, what impresses him in London, he says, is his staff’s passionate sense of public mission. “You would never think about doing something in this place before asking who it is for. You would never get lost in an intricate scholarly debate without coming back to that question: ‘How is our public going to profit from this?’ And I cherish every day working in this environment.”The music festival Europe and the World: a Symphony of Cultures, runs from 16 to 29 April. Rodin and the art of Ancient Greece runs from 26 April to 29 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21652220c12e4a62c5360786df0c1f2077c63afc/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a09b7e20b1f8199ca8594d62834d6468 1240w","title":"uk university strike action to end after staff vote to accept offer","story":"Ballot finds significant majority in favour of accepting offer to reopen talks over pensionsThe strike action that hit 65 universities across the UK this year is to end after staff voted to accept an offer to reopen negotiations with employers over their pensions.The ballot of 50,000 University and College Union members in higher education found a substantial majority in favour of accepting the offer, which establishes a joint committee of experts to evaluate pensions provided through the University Superannuation Scheme (USS).There was a high turnout of nearly two-thirds of eligible members, with more than 21,000 voting to accept the offer from Universities UK, and 12,000 voting to reject it. A further wave of strikes due to begin next week has been suspended.Fourteen days of teaching were lost to strikes on 65 campuses last term, with fears that further action in summer would disrupt final examinations and mean that students on some courses might be unable to graduate.The strike centred on a radical overhaul of the USS – the country’s largest private sector pension scheme with 400,000 members at 67 universities and colleges, as well as 300 specialist institutions such as the Royal Society and Cancer Research UK. Staff anger was triggered by a decision in January in favour of the employers that would have ended the scheme’s defined benefits – guaranteed levels of payment to members upon retirement.Instead, the fixed benefits would be replaced by defined contributions, in which members would pay in but their eventual pension payments would be dictated by their level of payment and the state of financial markets at retirement.Sally Hunt, the UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.“We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.”Universities UK said the decision to appoint an expert panel and suspend industrial action would reassure students that their exams would not be affected. “It is important that interested parties engage with the panel and remain open-minded about its possible findings,” a UUK spokesperson said.“Working in partnership with UCU, we will now appoint a jointly agreed chair for the panel as soon as possible before developing its terms of reference, order of work and timescales.”The Office for Students – the universities regulator in England – has told universities to make clear to students what the impact of the industrial action will be and how any related disruption will be handled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/147df4507932fe4c6843b395b9454f1390d9f86f/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0acabcb934e215d9b83b2fe15212e89","title":"champions league draw liverpool real madrid roma bayern munich semi finals","story":"Comparisons with Liverpool’s illustrious past have often irked Jürgen Klopp as he endeavours to illuminate the future and demands that his players write their own history.He will make an exception for a showpiece European occasion with Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. Tommy Smith’s bullet-header, Bruce Grobbelaar’s spaghetti legs and Alan Kennedy’s penalty will all form part of the Liverpool manager’s revision for what he hopes will be a Champions League semi-final shaped by destiny.Liverpool’s visit to the Italian capital for the semi-final second leg on 2 May will be Klopp’s first appearance at Stadio Olimpico. His club and their supporters will require no introduction. Two of Liverpool’s five European Cup triumphs were secured in Rome, against Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1977 and Roma in 1984, and Klopp will revisit both finals before meeting Eusebio Di Francesco’s team. The football fan in the German came to the fore as, for once, he looked back.Klopp is not averse to Liverpool history lessons it is the weight he feels it places on the club’s current players that he does not like. Having defeated Manchester City 5-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals he senses that weight may be lifting.“I love our history but it is not allowed to compare us constantly,” he says. “You can do whatever you want but it is not allowed for us. Those teams were great but they became great in these situations and now people say, ‘They did it like this.’1977:\u0026nbspLiverpool’s first European Cup final had Bob Paisley’s side take on Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Eternal City, with goals from Terry McDermott, Tommy Smith and Phil Neal’s penalty sealing a 3-1 victory. \u0027This is the second time I’ve beaten the Germans here,\u0027 said Paisley, who had been part of the Allied invasion of Italy in the second world war.\u0026nbsp1984:\u0026nbspVictories over Benfica and Dinamo Bucharest set up Liverpool’s fourth final in eight years. Their opponents were conquerors of Dundee United in the semi-finals and playing at their home stadium, but after Roberto Pruzzo cancelled out Neal’s opener, Bruce Grobbelaar’s wobbly legs helped secure a 4-2 victory in the penalty shootout.“I had a very famous German national player who was the coach of a second ision team when I was in the second ision. He did a shooting session and the boys were kind of my level so not too good. This guy took the ball and scored five times and said: ‘Look it is not that difficult.’ The boys were standing around and thinking now we know you can do it but we still have no clue. It is good to have role models but in the end you have to do it your own way.”Liverpool are gathering momentum as the season enters its defining period. Klopp, who insists victory over Bournemouth on Saturday should be the club’s sole focus when seeking a top-four finish, claims belief is also soaring among players, fans and Anfield legends, having reached the last four of the Champions League.He added: “It’s nice being in the semi-finals. Like I said before Manchester City, write our own history. You only judge history when you watch it back and I am really happy we are in a situation where we are focused on this group. The legends we all love are around and they are clapping because they like this. Kenny Dalglish is over the moon and completely on fire. Steven Gerrard and all the other guys in between, you can feel it and see it. That’s cool.“It’s normal when you go to a semi-final, especially after a long time and you hear the numbers – Bayern six times in a row, semi-final Madrid eight. Then Roma and us. That’s nice but in the end it’s a nice sign that we are so far so good.“The City game showed it but we have space to improve. Yes, in a few moments we can be at a really high level and we have a few things that make us an uncomfortable opponent and the other team has to think: ‘We better not do that’.“When they work they get more confident and now it’s a case of attitude, character, staying greedy and wanting to do the next step. That’s why it is important we are now fully focused on Bournemouth. Everything is positive, talk so much about positive things and as human beings when you constantly hear you are fantastic it is the first step to not being fantastic any more. We have to stay this kind of angry.“We have so much to go for and it will never stop because even if the season finishes there will be space for improvement and working from that is the plan. The relationship between us and the supporters, in terms of the sense of belief from both sides, has reached the next level and that’s all credit to the boys.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b45b517e79a7650467ab1c5a6e82d3425d586ecf/0_538_3698_2219/master/3698.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1b467493493806046059aa8d01c4ab14 1240w","title":"manchester city tottenham pep guardiola sergio aguero","story":"• City manager says team affected by three consecutive defeats• Argentina striker will miss trip to Tottenham with knee injuryPep Guardiola has said Manchester City could blow their 13-point lead over Manchester United and fail to be crowned champions.Guardiola’s team are clear favourites to win a third Premier League title, with City and United each having only six matches left. Yet having seen his team lose their previous three games – away and home to Liverpool in the Champions League, and in the league to United – the manager cited the example of Real Madrid in 2003‑04, when they led Valencia by a point but suffered six defeats in the final seven matches to finish fourth in La Liga, behind Rafael Benítez’s then side.City are at Tottenham Hotspur for Saturday’s late fixture. A victory, combined with a United defeat against West Brom on Sunday would secure the title but it was put to Guardiola that if City lose and United beat West Bromwich Albion and Bournemouth before his side play again they may start to feel the pressure.In this scenario United would have cut the deficit to seven points having played a match more. Guardiola said: “It can happen. Football is full of emotions but what we have to try to do is focus and win our games against Tottenham, Swansea and after that the other ones. So we know that.Regarding how pressure is more intense when trying to seal the title, Guardiola said: “That will be good for our future, you have to handle that. You have to learn that because, at the end, if we were not able to do it and United win the league, all we can say is ‘congratulations’ to United, reflect on what we have done badly in the last month and move forward. But in football it can happen.”Guardiola countered any notion that such a scenario is unlikely. “Of course it can happen, I assure you. Real Madrid, years ago, lost six games and didn’t win the league. So of course it can happen, no doubts about that.”“When the opponent is good, we will congratulate our opponents on beating us, and after learn from that for the next game.”While Guardiola admitted Sergio Agüero’s ability to play again this season is in the balance because of a knee problem, the Spaniard said the 32-year-old David Silva may appear less next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e0504ff0d1aed4350ac68d43917ac0f3cb213e/399_143_744_744/master/744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=464ec7869477c0b45511177fefb51395 1240w","title":"thomasina miers recipe for pickled herring beetroot and horseradish salad","story":" The sharpness of cured fish is a delight against tender and earthy beets, making a wonderful light lunchAt weekends I like to go to my local farmers’ market and head straight to the fish stand.

I started going to gigs at 16. Now I’m 47, and maybe I’m someone who hasn’t grown up because I typically go to between 40 and 50 gigs a year, all over the UK. It usually costs me about £500 a month, including travel.I’m a big fan of singer-songwriters, and old-school indie bands. My favourite artists are Morrissey, Adam Ant and Robert Forster, former member of the Go-Betweens. I’ve seen Forster 50 times in the last 30 years. He once did three UK gigs on consecutive nights in Glasgow, Manchester and London. I went to all three.I will also spend up to £20 on merchandise at each gig. But often I’ve already got all the stuff they’re selling – I spend £80 to £100 on CDs, books, DVDs and vinyl each month. It varies, depending on what has been released and whether I can resist the temptation.I don’t just listen to music – I play it, too. I own 25 guitars but they weren’t very expensive. The most I’ve ever spent on a guitar is £500.I don’t buy MP3s or subscribe to Spotify and I’ll always pay £1 extra for a ticket to be posted. I like owning a product. I’ve probably got over 1,000 vinyl records and maybe 2,000 CDs. Many are autographed or limited editions. I’ve got singles I paid £1.99 for that are worth £150, but I’d never sell them. They are for my kids.Songs come to life when you hear them performed live. There are subtle differences, you can hear the artist at work. I also love discovering the support acts. I once saw The Killers supporting British Sea Power at Colchester Arts Centre.Each music venue affects the character of the gig in different ways and changes how I experience the music. Life is about experiences, after all. You can’t take your money with you. All you have on your deathbed is what you’ve done with your life and the places you’ve been.I recently bought a folding bike for £100 so I could explore all the music venues in the cities I visit for gigs. I’m curious about venues whose names I know well from tour itineraries, and towns I wouldn’t normally go to. I find I often have great conversations with like-minded people I don’t know in the crowd. I’ve written a book, London Gig Venues, which covers 600 music venues in the city.Quite often, I’ll work out a route round the UK that enables me to combine our family holidays with a gig I want to go to.My very understanding wife will stay in, looking after our three children. We used to go together, before babysitters. Her favourite band is the Pet Shop Boys. Once we got tickets to see them, but my wife went into labour late. A day or two after the child was born, I went off with her sister to the gig. It’s unfortunate they were her favourite band but it didn’t make sense to waste the tickets.My daughter Ciara, who is 11, has been to about 20 gigs with me over the past two years. Often, when the band sees a little girl in the audience, they point her out. So she thinks every gig you go to, the artist makes a reference to it or you get to meet him or her afterwards.My wife has her own lifestyle PR agency and I work for her. We split the household bills. I pay £200 for council tax, £230 for gas and electricity, and £400 on food each month. My wife pays the mortgage and the broadband and mobile phone bills. She knew I was obsessed with music when we married but I have promised her I’ll cut down on gigs this year.Sometimes the children roll their eyes and say: “Daddy’s off to a gig again.” But I’m not someone who goes off to the pub or watches football. Music is my passion.As told to Donna Ferguson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff00af5ea36a10b9d75dd7cb6ab9ce08fbe89034/0_107_3520_2113/master/3520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ff613e521ab6953ed12232939ee58b3 1240w","title":"dua lipa review pop hydro glasgow","story":"SSE Hydro, GlasgowThe industrious singer’s giant arena show s futuristic disco hits and spine-tingling torch songs, performed with winningly jazzercise-style dance routines Can anything stop Dua Lipa? After a patient build-up, 2017 was such a breakthrough year for the bewitching London-born singer – selling over a million copies of her self-titled debut album and cruising past some of the world’s biggest pop stars to be crowned the most-streamed female artist in the UK – that she could probably take a few months off. But Lipa has continued her vertiginous career ascent in 2018, claiming two Brit awards in February, teaming up with dancefloor genie Calvin Harris for sleek new club banger One Kiss and insouciantly cracking a billion YouTube views for New Rules, her signature hit that warns against backsliding into a lousy relationship with a stern but moreish checklist-style mantra.While impressive on paper, racking up record-breaking streaming stats can sometimes feel like an intangible, almost passive form of success. But Lipa’s industrious workrate and gruelling tour schedule (including a stint supporting Coldplay) have clearly brought palpable real-world benefits. When she last played Glasgow six months ago it was in a crammed 2,500-capacity venue. Now she is packing them to the rafters in a giant arena bowl made for 13,000. Her core fanbase skews young and female but while the screams are as loud and piercing as at any Bieber show, the crowd seem keen to reflect back some of Lipa’s worldly sophistication. Compared to most full-bore pop gigs at the Hydro, there is a distinct lack of strobing deely boppers.On magazine covers and in impeccably styled promo shots, Lipa often looks aloof or simply nonplussed. But the 22-year-old kicks off by imploring fans to “be your most unapologetic you” and “dance the night away”, and promptly leads by example through Blow Your Mind (Mwah), a slice of futuristic disco that slyly incorporates an actual kiss-off into its chorus. For sustained stretches of her 90-minute show, Lipa is in perpetual motion, bouncing and reeling round the stage in billowing black joggers, springy trainers and aquamarine bra. She is flanked by four equally tireless dancers while her long-serving backing trio of a drummer and two multitasking keyboardguitarists jam away atop oversized stage cubes.A massive projection screen showing artfully stylised visuals and pulsing hyperspace starfields is arena-show standard but otherwise there is a distinct lack of large-scale staging gimmicks. It makes it all the more impressive that Lipa is able to sustain so many winningly jazzercise-style dance routines without missing a note.There are moments of delirious communion, as when Lipa hoists herself up on the front-row stage barrier to conduct a singalong to the yearning Be the One. But there are also moments of spine-tingling spotlight: the stripped-down obsessional ballad Thinking ’Bout You, with just her and guitar, showcases her voice at its smokiest. Strip away the headstrong beats and synthy stabs of her biggest hits and Lipa would remain a potent, intuitive torch singer.The biggest laugh of the night comes toward the end when a title card pops up dedicating IDGAF to “all the fuckboys who have done you wrong”. While this playground-chant anthem to empowerment doesn’t yet match the climactic New Rules in terms of streams and views, it is – perhaps tellingly – the song fans are raucously singing a capella as they spill out of the venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23ddeb1c231125bb3a2b5cff4777fedb30e5c83c/0_1290_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4e7e2c4048124a5a5c1a13f3ada06623 1240w","title":"tinashe people are past point they think im a mindless puppet","story":"The R\u0026ampB star has defied bullies, the wrath of Wendy Williams and the insidious music industry. With her new album Joyride, has her moment finally arrived?Halfway through school at California’s Crescenta Valley High, budding actor Tinashe Jorgensen Kachingwe made a new best friend. She was delighted to have found this new acquaintance, and sad when she had to leave school for two months to shoot a TV movie, Cora Unashamed. On her return to Crescenta, she discovered her BFF didn’t like her any more. No one did. Her friend turned into a bully and created a We Hate Tinashe group of which she was leader. She would ring Kachingwe at home to describe exactly how she was going to “fuck her up” at school the next day. She, like everyone else, didn’t like the fact Kachingwe was on TV. “There were groups of girls who would throw food at me in the hallways,” she remembers. “Like, cereal. And milk. Gross stuff like that. People were pretty mean.” Despite such torrential tormenting, the 25-year-old – now the singer who goes simply by Tinashe – is remarkably sanguine about these experiences. “It led me to be hyper-focused on what I wanted from life and that was how I was able to stay happy and not get depressive as a kid,” she says in the cafe of New York’s New Museum, where we meet to discuss her long-overdue second album proper, Joyride. “It’s easy to feel like the whole world is against you as a kid, but the world is bigger than school.” It’s a lesson Tinashe has retained, applying the same sage standards to “what people are saying online” about her life and music. “Everything will get better. You just have to keep focusing on what makes you happy and what fulfils you. For me that’s making music and performing.” Does she still see those girls? “Fuckin’ bitches,” she grins. “Where are they now?”Although people no longer chuck food at Tinashe’s head, they do throw a lot of shade her way. They question why her records don’t sell. With her catalogue a combination of subtle, silky trap and rap-infused tracks and glossy hits (Player the DJ Mustard co-produced 2 On her collaboration with Snakehips on All My Friends) critics say she’s either too pop or too R\u0026ampB – or not enough of either. “I think genres should just die,” she says. “As a human being, you don’t limit yourself to being one thing or other I don’t think people think of themselves in that way. It’s the same for how I present my music, how I listen to music, how I dress, how I live my life. It’s not black and white. Who you are is actually much more complex.”The last time she spoke to the Guardian the internet disseminated Tinashe’s thoughts on colourism and sexism (“Sometimes I feel like I don’t fully fit into the black community they don’t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman,” being one quote). Television host Wendy Williams delivered a snippy three-minute bit about the interview. “She’s blaming Rihanna and Beyoncé for her lack of success?” Williams asked. “You have no one to blame but yourself, Tinashe. You gotta make your own path. Mariah, Drake and Alicia Keys are all biracial, so what’s your next excuse?”Meanwhile, fans and trolls lined up to wonder where the album was and whether it might sell more than her “critically acclaimed” (translation: didn’t sell well) debut, 2014’s Aquarius. This is another aspect of “the business” that Tinashe has little time for. “You’re either at this super-high level of fame and dominating the whole world or you’re a failure, which is just not accurate,” she insists. “My definition of success has changed over the course of this album. I’ve learned that making the music and art and videos I want to make, that’s enough for me. I don’t feel like I need all the accolades.”It has taken Tinashe time to reach such a place of self-satisfaction, however. With more than 200 tracks recorded and “numerous” iterations of Joyride in the vault, the album seemed destined never to see the light of day. Finally, last summer, Tinashe let go a little. She moved into a new home in the Hollywood Hills with sweeping views of LA and turned the guesthouse into a studio. She invited friends, producers, writers, graphic designers and artists over and together they zeroed in on the music, artwork and videos.“It was a really big turning point for me because I was able to focus creatively and get all my thoughts in one place. It really gave me perspective on what I’d already created and what I still needed to work on. It was more focused, more purposeful.”Joyride is a delightfully sleazy bop, full of red-light R\u0026ampB, woozy hip-hop and lyrics that linger on hook-ups and getting high. “It’s a snapshot of when I wasn’t in a relationship and I was trying to find myself,” she says. “That sense of confidence and almost braggadociousness was something that I wanted to express on the album – ‘I don’t need anybody, I’m good.’” She is now in a relationship with the basketball player Ben Simmons, another reason she’s living life a little lighter. “Ben has been an important part of being able to let go of the album creatively. Because you can get crazy,” she says.Funnily enough, it looks as if Joyride could just be a hit the Offset-featuring single No Drama clocked up a million views in one day, while the delightfully tactile Me So Bad and title track Joyride are streaming at rapid rates. The album is self-assured, a bit frivolous but occasionally weighty – such as on Easy on Me, which voices her frustrations with politics in the United States. The track, an interlude, is one of two Tinashe has produced on Joyride, having taught herself Pro Tools when she was 17. “When I first got on the scene I was honestly shocked that I could work for a whole year with hundreds of engineers and producers and not one would be another woman. We need to see more representation.”Having been in the entertainment industry for so much of her life – as both an actor (including her role as Celeste Burnett on Charlie Sheen’s Two and a Half Men) and a singer (who could forget her stint in the Stunners, a shortlived girlband signed to Columbia in 2007) – Tinashe has a deep understanding of the seismic shifts occurring at the moment. She believes, however, that the music business has a long way to go in order to catch up with the rest of the entertainment industry when it comes to the #MeToo movement.“Mostly it’s people’s perceptions of what it means to be a female artist and how you deal with your sexuality and people respecting your creative opinion. I haven’t had any straight-up, very outwardly sexist experiences in the music industry I’ve been very lucky. Maybe one session where I had to walk out where I was uncomfortable. But for the most part I’ve worked with really great people. The issue is really a systemic, cultural one that impacts across the board.”It’s time to leave the New Museum – Tinashe has a stack of CDs to sign before getting up at 4am to do Good Morning America. Before she goes, however, I wonder if she is really as happy, as calm, as sorted as she appears?“Honestly, yes. I think people respect me as an artist now. I’ve been making art for a good number of years. People have got past the point where they think I’m just a cute girl or a mindless puppet of a record label.” She may not yet be a superstar, but actually Tinashe is really very successful. And that’s more than enough. “However this album does, I’ve come to realise that I’m not going to stop making music if it isn’t a hit. I can say the same for the next album and the next album. So be it. I’m going to continue to make art and everything’s gonna be OK. I’m happy and confident and excited and proud of what I’ve done. Life is all right!”You believe her, you really do.Joyride is out now on RCA Records"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd46d18282e53e786314bf62f159e644e1204ee/0_167_2439_1463/master/2439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82cac3cca467042bde4ed1cc74637e93 1240w","title":"pm among cabinet members earning money as a landlord","story":"Exclusive: senior politicians such as Theresa May and Boris Johnson make thousands of pounds a year renting propertyNine cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, are making more than £10,000 a year by acting as landlords, a Guardian analysis has found.Following Jeremy Hunt’s failure to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he subsequently rented out, an analysis of the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests shows eight other members of the cabinet own property that is rented out for a five-figure annual sum.The health secretary was forced to make an embarrassing apology on Friday after it emerged that he had failed to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests.Hunt has amended the register, which now shows that he has a half share of a holiday home in Italy, a half share in an office building in Hammersmith and seven recently acquired apartments in Southampton.Theresa May and Philip Hammond, who both live in Downing Street, rent out their personal homes in central London. Communities and housing secretary Sajid Javid also rents out property, while Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, rents out two properties, according to the registerThe foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the international trade secretary Liam Fox, the minister without portfolio Brandon Lewis – who is also the Conservative party chairman – and the Welsh minister Alun Cairns also own and rent out a property, according to the register.There is no suggestion that the ministers are in breach of the ministerial code.Hunt’s declared property interests are comfortably larger than any of the other ministers listed. He set up Mare Pond Properties Ltd with his wife, Lucia Guo which have since bought seven flats in Alexandra Wharf, a redevelopment project on the Southampton waterfront worth £40m.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only his wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.Kathryn Hudson, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday and will consider it early next week, a spokesperson said. Labour said Hunt’s actions represented a “serious breach”. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: “This is simply unacceptable and especially so given the secretary of state’s position at the heart of Theresa May’s government.”Guardian inquiries have established that the flats were developed by a property company owned by a Conservative donor.The 82-flat luxury block was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property company owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of the complimentary venue hire.Hunt and Roach were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel partly developed by Roachs’ company in Guildford, which is in Hunt’s Surrey constituency.A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase”.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m. The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House’ documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the ministerial code. “We consider the matter closed.” Dr Alex May, the academic who spotted Hunt’s omissions and whose email on 28 March prompted a change to Hunt’s Companies House filing, told the Guardian that the health secretary’s office only admitted wrongdoing after he went public with the information on Friday. “There is a lack of scrutiny from Companies House,” he said. “It allows people to break the law, sometimes unwittingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b22c13d0e561594d85eac3b51f3e47e80fb8a63/0_318_5254_3154/master/5254.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7dc885aee12ad3190fd1c08ea6cfac3c 2600w","title":"jeremy thorpe the charismatic liberal leader who hid dark secrets","story":"A BBC drama recounts the old Etonian’s bizarre story at the heart of a corrupt British establishmentIt’s a long time since the second week of May in 1979 when Jeremy Thorpe arrived in his lawyer’s brown Rolls Royce for the start of the trial that was billed as “the greatest show on earth”.Few people under 40 know who Thorpe even was, let alone the scandal that enthralled the country for more than a month as it unfolded at the Old Bailey. Yet the tale is so bizarre, so improbable and at the same time so revealing of the profound corruption of the British establishment that it seems wilfully irresponsible not to make its study a compulsory part of the national curriculum.Next month might change that. That’s when the BBC airs its star-studded account of the fantastical story of how Thorpe, the old Etonian who had led the Liberal party for a decade from the mid 1960s, faced trial on the charge of conspiracy to murder his former lover.The three-part drama, A Very English Scandal, written by Russell T Davies – responsible for acclaimed hits including Queer as Folk, Casanova and Cucumber – and directed by Stephen Frears, is based on the book of the same name by John Preston. It stars Hugh Grant as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott, the young riding instructor with whom Thorpe conducted an on-off affair.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, remembers Thorpe even before he became party leader. He came to speak to the Liberal club when he was at Cambridge in the mid 1960s. “Jo Grimond was party leader, Thorpe was the entertainment.” Thorpe’s charm didn’t work on Cable, who joined the Labour party.Thorpe was also gay. Early in the 1960s, when he had the affair with Scott, he was the newly elected Liberal MP for North Devon and homosexuality was still illegal. For more than 10 years, the paths of the two men crossed and recrossed, Thorpe’s career advancing as Scott, suffering from recurring mental illness, struggled.Thorpe and his small gang of cronies concluded Scott was a threat to Thorpe and the party. After repeated attempts to silence him, an inner circle began to consider a permanent solution. One of the more arresting claims at the trial was that Thorpe had suggested: “It would be no worse than shooting a sick dog.” How else is it possible to explain the two central questions of the Thorpe affair: why did Thorpe, , an iconoclastic campaigner for human rights and colonial freedom, think it was a sound idea to deal with a perceived threat by arranging the death of the person he feared?Why did it take so long to challenge him? And how, when finally brought to justice, did he get away with it? Thirty-one enthralling days after the trial at the Old Bailey began, Thorpe emerged triumphant, exonerated in law if not in the public esteem.Maybe his bisexuality – he was married, happily, twice and once told a crowd of Oxford undergraduates that he wasn’t married because “why buy a car when you can hire a taxi” – shaped an outlook that instinctively chose secrecy over transparency.Or perhaps the establishment simply preferred not to know. Maybe that curious mix of Whitehall with traditional political allegiances and deep social conservatism that revealed nothing of the dry rot eating its supporting joists, dealt with challenge by ignoring it.Most of the participants are dead. Thorpe himself, cruelly wracked by Parkinsons and still aggrieved never to have been rehabilitated with a seat in the Lords, died in 2014. Only Scott lives on in Devon, not far from the scene of the alleged attempt on his life.It is ancient history. Yet aspects of the trial feel uncomfortably fresh. The leading defence witness, Peter Bessell, was discredited mainly because before the trial he had unwisely flogged a story to the Daily Telegraph detailing what he had been prepared to do for Thorpe before they fell out. Cheque book journalism has never quite gone away.The judge, Sir Joseph Cantley, was a shameless social sycophant whose summing up to the jury, almost indistinguishable from a speech for the defence, dishonoured the reputation of British justice. That might not happen now, but the sense of a system where the avenues to the top are open almost exclusively to a narrow ethnic and social group that is also largely male is still all too familiar.And then there’s the politics.Thorpe was elected leader of his tiny party in 1967, the party’s 12 MPs were the only voters. Thorpe went further and faster than his predecessor, Grimond, developing a radical foreign policy fit for a post-colonial era. And he did it at a time when the plodding conservatism of both the main parties and the renewed radicalism of young voters dramatically magnified the effect.His wit and charm worked as well at a fundraising dinner as in the TV studios or, in the ultimate piece of 1970s symbolism, out wooing seaside holidaymakers from a hovercraft. (“What are you going to say to them?” asked his campaign manager, the MP John Pardoe. “Oh that’s for you to decide,” Thorpe loftily replied.)His alchemist’s touch with money helped to dispel doubts among party members becoming increasingly frustrated by his gang of chums and secretive manner. They didn’t know then how much of the cash he persuaded generous donors, like Jack Hayward, to part with was being erted to deal with his obsessive fear of Scott.And Thorpe was often a lucky politician. Events favoured him. Take Europe it was his tiny party’s votes that allowed the Tory government to steer European legislation through parliament in the early 70s.On the surface, Thorpe continued untarnished – the beguiling, charismatic leader of a minority party that was developing interesting, radical ideas about what politics was for.It was despite rather than because of Thorpe that Liberals discovered pavement politics and began to rebuild their party from the ground up. Yet at least some of this generation of young liberals had been drawn in by Thorpe’s radical energy.Ming Campbell, a former Lib Dem leader, thinks Thorpe’s successor, David Steel, was his real legacy. “What did we get? A son of the manse who shared his radicalism but none of his reputation.” Duncan Brack, a party historian, accepts that Thorpe trashed the brand. Yet, “he propelled the party into people’s consciousness. He got a lot of attention. His success in the two 1974 elections was the basis for the Alliance of the 1980s.”The Lib Dem blogger Mark Pack agrees: “The base that grew in the Alliance days began in his time. When Labour split, the Liberals were a more credible party than they might have been.”This is the Thorpe legacy: a disfigured memorial to the way the establishment could still look after its own even as the forces of modernity slowly washed away at its foundations. Some claim that the scandal changed the establishment for ever. If only.

The Leicester and England prop does not care for statistics but one in particular has caught his eye. Genge often treads the line between confrontational and combustible – “He’s more bark than bite,” said his head coach, Matt O’Connor, recently – but the 23-year-old feels his reputation for losing his temper on the field is unjustified.“I’ve given away one penalty for ill-discipline all season and that was last weekend,” he says. “For some reason I’m carrying around this dark cloud that means I’m Mr Angry but if you’re a prop and you haven’t got a bit of a temper you’re playing the wrong position. Everyone thinks I am a raving lunatic but it is not the case at all. It is just how I play – I am not frustrated in any way, shape or form. I just enjoy doing what I do.”Genge’s difficult upbringing on the West Knowle estate in Bristol is well documented. He was a latecomer to rugby – taking up the sport as a means to channel his aggression – and by his own admission, his rapid emergence into the Leicester first team last season meant for a steep learning curve. “I was a lot angrier when I was 18 than I am now. Now it’s channelled more so into rugby than in everyday life. I’ve seen a lot of sports psychologists, done a bit of therapy, stuff like that,” he says. “Everyone has a different story to tell and you have just got to work it out yourself, it’s part of the process of growing up. Luckily, I’ve done quite a lot of that, quite quickly.”Leicester and England are thankful that he has. Genge has recently recovered from a shoulder injury – a torn labrum that meant three months out – but before and after that he has been one of the Tigers’ best performers. He carries with unbridled aggression – he was described as a “baby rhino with a dart up its backside” earlier this season – but in the two matches since his return from injury it is his scrummaging that has stood out. In his comeback match against Wasps last month, Genge’s emergence from the bench turned the game in Leicester’s favour and he marmalised Bath’s Shaun Knight at Twickenham last Saturday. “With scrums I used to get built up too much around frustration and wound up so that I forgot about set-up and technique,” he says. “I’ve dialled that down now so when I’m in the scrum I can apply myself.”Genge’s improvement at the scrum is down to a number of factors. He was a late convert to the front row, having previously played No 8, and he played through the pain of his injury, including his most recent England appearance against Samoa in November, before finally going under the knife. When fit and firing though, O’Connor believes Genge is the prototype for modern props and, while he missed the Six Nations, he seems a certainty for the summer tour of South Africa irrespective of England’s riches at loosehead.“I’m feeling very strong. I am like a bull, the rehab was quite a long and daunting process because I have never had a long-term injury,” says Genge. “But everyone plays international rugby when they’re hurt.Genge clearly enjoys being typecast as the hard man. Asked if he relishes confrontation he fixes his stare before simply replying with “I love it” so his passion of fine-dining may seem incongruous. It does, however, extend to an appearance as a guest judge in a rugby-themed episode of Masterchef. “They needed my culinary expertise,” he says. “Being a prop I’m allowed to eat a lot of food. I love the show as well, my agent knew that, the opportunity arose and I got the chance to go on there and pretend I knew what I was talking about.”He does not pretend to when it comes to the east Midlands rivalry with Northampton – who visit Welford Road on Saturday – but with Leicester closing on their perennial play-off place, Genge is relishing the end-of-season run-in. “I’m not a Leicester lad but I feel like I’ve been adopted by the fans, which is lovely,” he says. “I like the vibe I get from the boys and I feed off that but it’s not my city so I can’t preach on that too much.• Land Rover, the official vehicle partner of Premiership Rugby, is celebrating 10 seasons of supporting grassroots rugby in the UK.

A bit of a girl clutching the neck of a bandy-legged outsider streaked across the line to win the greatest race in turfdom! A girl wins the Grand National!”Thus gabbles the radio commentator in the 1944 film National Velvet, heralding the success of a character played by Elizabeth Taylor. Three parts of a century have since rolled by and horse racing reporters are still waiting for their chance to trumpet such a line for real, hopefully without the patronising diminutive. But perhaps the moment is finally at hand because Saturday’s race will feature an almost unprecedented three female jockeys.They have not been booked for outsiders, bandy-legged or otherwise their horses feature in the top half of the betting. Nor are they unknown teenagers, like Taylor’s character, but established riders of proven talent. On his way to Aintree on Thursday, the Telegraph’s man tweeted a picture of Enid Bagnold’s novel that was the source for National Velvet and asked: “Is this the most relevant form book for this year’s race?”Bagnold’s heroine, the strong-willed Velvet Brown with her uncanny empathy for a horse, is arguably a pallid creation by comparison with the effervescent Bryony Frost, who will take her first tilt at the National aboard Milansbar. Frost, a self-described “Devon dumpling” and the daughter of a National-winning rider, had a donkey for a babysitter from the age of two and used to fall asleep on his back. She was in pony races from the age of nine. If ever a person was born and raised to be a steeplechase jockey, she was.She will be joined in Saturday’s lineup by Rachael Blackmore, only the second female professional jockey in the history of Irish jump racing, and Katie Walsh, whose third place in the 2012 National is the best result achieved by a woman. Those coincidence backers annually drawn to the National may like to know that Walsh’s mount, Baie Des Iles, will carry the same saddle-cloth number (28) as did Taylor’s in the movie.The no-nonsense Walsh will surely take no interest in such a detail. Asked if this is a significant moment, she underlines the importance of opportunity. “The reality of it is that I’m riding for my husband. And Rachael has an association with Gigginstown, owners of her horse. And Bryony is riding a horse she won on last time.“Next year, that might not be the case. I wouldn’t be riding in the National, if I wasn’t riding one for Ross.”Walsh was born into a racing family, which opened doors. She is well aware other talented jockeys, male and female, are less fortunate. “It’s just so competitive. It’s a very small, condensed sport and there’s only room for a handful of people at the top.”Only once before have three women ridden in the National, 30 years ago. Penny Ffitch-Heyes and Venetia Williams were thrilled to be in the lineup but both were on no-hopers, at odds of 100-1 and 200-1 respectively, and neither got beyond the sixth fence. Gee Armytage fared better on Gee-A, leading the field on the run down to the second Becher’s before her horse tired.Female participation in the National had become the norm, soon after Charlotte Brew was the trailblazer in 1977. Over the next 12 years, 11 different women had rides in the race. Since then, only four new names have been added to the list. While Walsh and her sister-in-law Nina Carberry have had 11 rides between them, no other woman has lined up since 2005. Where did all the female jump jockeys go?Some, including Armytage, have suggested trainers and owners were put off using women by a series of shocking injuries, including the death of Jayne Thompson at Catterick and the paralysis suffered by Sharron Murgatroyd and Jessica Charles-Jones in incidents at other tracks. Such things also happened to men, but female pain, according to the theory, was harder for some people to contemplate.That is not how Williams sees it, having had a long and successful career as a trainer. “I don’t think injuries are what put people off, really. Maybe that was the party line but we weren’t very good. End of. These girls are a hell of a lot better than we were in my day.“Gee Armytage might get a bit cross with me for saying that,” she adds, laughing, “but they’re streets better.”Thanks to the cumulative effect of Walsh, Carberry, Frost and Blackmore, it seems racing insiders are increasingly prepared to accept the right woman on the right horse can successfully fight her corner in any jumps race. Paul Nicholls, a former champion trainer, has given Frost a huge push. Gigginstown Stud, the dominant owner in Irish jumps racing, regularly employs female jockeys.Frost and Blackmore will inevitably, some day, get chances to prove how resilient they can be when injured. But when one reporter told Frost this week to “come back in one piece”, she just laughed.“I’m not worried about that,” she said. “Getting in the car is the most dangerous part of the day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6104861bbc332f057d22b77698e34e845e6cc99e/0_0_2623_1573/master/2623.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3df8c8ff0f5c5c285b5783fc6230864c 1240w","title":"leeds wigan rugby super league match report","story":"• Leeds 8-9 Wigan• Tomkins manages five points as Wigan win from 8-0 downPerhaps it was inevitable Sam Tomkins would have the last laugh. In the moments leading up to kick-off, he was ridiculed by the Leeds supporters after slipping while attempting a warm-up conversion attempt. In true Tomkins fashion, it still sailed through the posts.Tomkins has plenty of previous with Leeds, of course – seven years ago he was in the thick of the headlines when Wigan beat the Rhinos in the Challenge Cup final – but how he and Wigan will have savoured this moment more than most.Wins at Leeds do not come easily for Wigan, who had not won here since 2012. And, just as he has been so many times before, Tomkins was at the heart of this latest performance, though the question remains as to how many more he will be involved in beyond this season.Speculation continues to link the 29-year-old with a move to Catalans for 2019 the general consensus is that the deal is already done. “Whatever happens, we’ll deal with it,” responded Shaun Wane when asked about Tomkins’s future. On nights like these it is clear to see why Wigan would want to keep him.And a remarkable ending – in which Wigan overturned an eight-point deficit in the final nine minutes to win courtesy of Tomkins’s game-winning drop goal – at least managed to somewhat overshadow a game which is highly unlikely to make it to the end-of-season highlights package.For over an hour, both sides toiled amidst a host of penalties and handling errors it was far from the ideal advert for Super League in a game featuring the competition’s last two champions. And when Leeds went eight points ahead with 16 minutes remaining, the smart money was on them leapfrogging Wigan into second place. And, in their coach’s own enigmatic way, he summed up their collapse well. “We stuck our heads up our backside and didn’t pull them out,” Brian McDermott said. “We started playing crazy and we changed the way we played.”Leeds scored the only try of a largely forgettable and frustrating first half, after a fine Richie Myler pass found Tom Briscoe unmarked. It was a rare moment of quality, with the next points not coming until after the hour mark when Watkins kicked Leeds into a two-score lead.Wigan’s performance to that point was epitomised by Tomkins, whose effort and endeavour was underlined by unforced errors, but he would ultimately have the final say. He played a part in the move which allowed Oliver Gildart to score with nine minutes remaining, and after he kicked the conversion, he followed suit with a penalty before sending over the drop goal which won the game with three minutes left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd2fecbdd740807626c3093998c66a32f833d833/0_0_4500_3000/master/4500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac81e198b05f1e0ac12d51c2e8d5a4a5 880w","title":"commonwealth games 2018 day 10 athletics cycling boxing and more live","story":"Well, if ‘Namibia, Land of the Brave’ left you wanting more, strap yourself in because ladies and gentlemen – for the very first time in Commonwealth Games history we’re about to hear ‘Sons and Daughters of Saint Lucia’!A terrific performance from the veteran Levern Spencer – she missed her very first jump at 1.80m but ten jumps later has sailed over 1.95m to deliver the tiny Caribbean nation its first ever gold medal!England’s Morgan Lake pushed her all the way, clearing 1.93m for the silver, with Australia’s Nicola McDermott’s mark of 1.91m – a personal best – enough to grab the bronze. Canada fourth and Antigua and Barbuda fifth.I wonder what their anthem’s like. There’s been no love so far on the podium front in nine Commonwealth appearances, but maybe they can take inspiration from tiny Saint Lucia?Okay, we’re back on track. And again it’s Kenya who will look to lead the way in the men’s 1500m.The battle once again could be for the minor medals – with bronze or perhaps even silver very much up for grabs, but it will take something amazing to catch either Elijah Manangoi or Timothy Cheruiyot.Local hope Ryan Gregson could benefit from a parochial home crowd, but watch Scotland’s Chris O’Hare as well.We’re underway, it seems reasonably quick, the three Kenyans move to the head, but bronze medallist in the 800m Australia’s Luke Matthews looks to take his share of the pacemaking.Two laps to go and it’s Gregson well-placed on the should of the Kenyans, Scotland’s Jake Wightman also there or there abouts.We head for the bell, and the pace kicks up. Manangoi and Cheruiyot are off, Kumari Taki can’t stay with them. Here comes Wightman, he powers past Taki and onto the tail of the two Kenyans.Manangoi kicks again he’s got just enough – and Cheruiyot can’t match it!It’s Kenya one-two once more, but what a barnstorming finish from Wightman for bronze! England’s Grice takes fourth with India’s Jinson Johnson in fifth, with Gregson fading. A cracking finish though!We’ve got men’s triple jump underway and we’re getting to the pointy end in the women’s high jump, but a reminder for all those New Zealanders coming home from shift work or wireless-free deck parties, anxious to see how their women’s hockey team got on:Well, it was a 4-1 shellacking of overwhelming favourites Australia, in the New Zealand royal family was there in attendance to take it all in.Okay, not technical royalty, but PM Jacinda Ardern, ‘first man’ Clarke Gayford and ‘first baby’ (not pictured) must have rubbed some of their sparkle off as the Black Sticks put on an absolute showing. A great result – watch again later tonight as these two rivals square off once more in the men’s gold medal match.And while track was taking centre stage, field was hotting up in the men’s javelin.We touched earlier with local hope Hamish Peacock starting strongly. I should have waited a few more throws, because India’s Neeraj Chopra then came out and threw a 85.50m to open! Cripes.He’s got the boyish good looks of a Bollywood star and the pace on the runway of a fast bowler, and he’s got the local crowd eating from his hand. He is launching himself with every throw, as he strains to pack as much power as conceivable into his throw he ends up almost with a front cartwheel I don’t know the technical merit of this, but sheesh it’s effective.Grenada’s Anderson Peters has launched a 82.20m thunderbolt with his second effort. Will he be the man to reel in Chopra?Peacock fires his fourth effort and the crowd responds! Terrific consistency with all four throws between 75-81m, but this one goes better – 82.59m and he moves into silver medal position.And as if to respond instantly, look at this from Chopra. It flies, he flies – and it’s beyond the gold medal best. 86.47m – they won’t be beating this!India gold, Australia silver, Grenada bronze. He’s got an arm like a traction engine!I’ll not lie to you, good people of the Commonwealth, it’s a cracking pace we’re setting on day 10. It feels almost like that high school essay you leave until the night before, because they are really cramming in the events up here on the GC today.I’ll have updates for you shortly from table tennis and shooting where more golds have dropped, and also where we’re at in the various field events, but now: women’s 5000m.We’ve just got underway, which by my reckoning gives me about 14 minutes to make up some stats for you.Okay, the daylight favourite here is Kenya’s Hellen Obiri, who learned track devotees will recall is our 2017 World Champion and 2016 Rio Games silver medallist.It’s a gentle pace set over the first few laps which might play into the Kenyan’s hands. Also a medal prospect is Obiri’s compatriot Margaret Kipkemboi, with Scotland’s duo of Eilish McColgan and Steph Twell also in the mix. Eloise Wellings is the best of the locals and one of only five runners here who has dropped a sub-15 previously.We’re around 2km in and it’s a slow pace thus far, projected to be c.16 minutes, but I imagine it will come down as we get to the business end. It’s the three Kenyans leading, with Twell and two Australians at the head of it.There’s a slight break now with those six opening up with four more on the tail and an athlete from New Zealand attempting to bridge the gap. Our medals should come from these 11. Five laps to go.And here’s our first significant acceleration – and it’s the two Kenyans, Kipkemboi and Obiri who have put distance between themselves and the chasing field. They’re rotating the pace-making, and it’s difficult to see who has the better form.Uganda’s Juliet Chekwel has made a dash from the back to move into bronze medal position with two laps to go. England’s Laura Weightman has moved into fourth, Australia’s Celia Sullohern also there with Wellings and Eva Cherono also a threat for bronze. So we’ve two races within races – who gets gold and who gets bronze.We’ve about 300m to run, and here goes Obiri! She kicks again, and this time Kipkemboi can’t match her! It’s a Kenyan one-two, but what a storming finish here from Weightman. She’s come from the clouds for the bronze. Kenya, Kenya, England for the medals!And if you love a new anthem – run over to the Oxenford Studios right now where the brass band is banging out Namibia’s ditty, because the man called Jonas (twice) has done it! A brave showing from the Canadian Blumenfeld, such mental toughness and resilience in the face of frankly, a pounding, but he settles for silver in the men’s 64kg category.And having waited 12 years to hear that anthem I can happily report – it’s not a banger.Why can’t we have Finland at the Commonwealth Games? He knew how to get the toes tapping did ol’ Sibelius.. Still, a happy mixup from Advance Australia Fair.Our roving correspondent Mike Hytner has been taking in all today’s action live from the Gold Coast, sloping around with a keen eye and hat marked ‘press’ – here’s his view of the cycling road race (the rumble in Currumbin?) and the infamous upset at the Hockeydome:Treat yourself and take a read, I hear it’s a big f*cking deal.Fun fact o’clock – if you thought it a surprise that England would do the double over Jamaica in the 4x100m relays, then let us take a cursory walk down history lane.So, there’s no doing these things by halves it seems, as the pendulum swings back to England in this remarkable two-horse relay race history. So it’s Jamaica, Australia, Ghana, Cameroon, England, Nigeria, The Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago to choose from.Some sprint royalty here, but Jamaica find themselves with the unlikely draw of lane 1, given there were no qualifiers for this event and thus a random draw. Will it hamper Elaine Thompson and friends?We’re underway, Asher-Smith powering England away, Jamaica really off the pace early on, we’ve got a baton drop, I think it was Australia, Jamaica with a power of work to do here – they turn for the fourth leg and it’s the sprint queen vs the long jumper, Thompson v Ugen, she’s catching, she’s powering, the stadium holds it’s breath.. but England survive!Gold to England, silver to Jamaica and bronze to Nigeria, daylight fourth as Australia stumble on fourth change! England go the double! Remarkable.A fine opening throw from Australian Hamish Peacock not quite the dramatic entrance we saw from Kathryn Mitchell who came and destroyed the entire field with her first Games record effort in the women’s competition. Still, a very tidy mark of 75.95m to get us underway.We’ve also got women’s high jump happening, where the bar has started at 1.60m. A lovely clearance from Swaziland’s Nonhlanhla Seyama at 1.65m among others as we power through the early stages. Many still sitting out and awaiting a higher bar.We’re back to the track for now though, as we prepare for the women’s 4x100m final. Stand by.First medal to be determined on the track today as Jamaica looks to seek amends for that 100m upset by South Africa.They’re out quickly but there’s a baton drop on the second leg, was it Nigeria?Australia and England are right in the mix here, but it’s a very fast finish from South Africa and Jamaica. It was England and Australia one-two on the home straight but look at this final leg from Simbine and also Blake. They’ve mowed Josh Clarke down for second, will they catch England?! They hold on! England grab gold, South Africa silver, Jamaica bronze, and Australia fourth! Simbine has beaten Blake again, wowee.Redemption for Zharnel Hughes – disqualified after seemingly winning gold in the 200m – but he’s got his Commonwealth gold. What a finish!We’ve got live results coming in from the men’s boxing as well, where once more it’s the podium nations that are dominating. Australian Harry Garside has continued his fine run winning gold for the host nation in the men’s 60kg ision over India’s Manish Kaushik, India then turning table with gold in the men’s 52kg for Gaurav Solanki, before England returned the favour, relegating India to silver in the men’s \u0026lt49kg with Galal Yafai emerging triumphant.We’re just in time to see my boy Jonas Jonas (see yesterday) of Namibia trade blows with Canada’s Thomas Blumenfeld. Can he win his nation’s first Games medal since Melbourne 2006?He’s got a height and reach advantage on the Canadian, and pound for pound he looks the stronger but you can’t fault the tenacity of Blumenfeld he’s got a welt across his left eye but he continues to come at his taller opponent.We’ve just finished the second round, and Blumenfeld has been deducted a point for losing his mouthguard mid-bout for the third time. Was it deliberate, to snatch a breather? Who could say. Seems a bizarre way to lose if this one ends up going down to the wire.We’ll revisit this, as the track and field has begun over at Carrara Stadium.Well if you’re just joining us, there’s an absolute boilover unfolding in the women’s hockey – we’re deep in the fourth quarter and it appears that New Zealand are cruising home to an emphatic win over hosts Australia, it’s 4-1!Australia you’ll remember were yet to concede even a goal throughout their entire campaign, but it’s the Black Sticks who have blown them away with a goal in the second quarter, and two more in the third to run out to a commanding lead.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern watches from the stand about to witness New Zealand claim their first ever Commonwealth gold don’t forget the Australian team have won this event at three consecutive Games in fact you’d have to go back to 2002 for the last time anyone beat them!Shiloh Gloyn got the opener with around 28 minutes played, before a fine reverse tomahawk off the floor from Rose Keddell made it 2-0 as Australia failed to clear their lines following a penalty corner.Olivia Merry stretched the advantage to three with another strike from a penalty corner, before Australia threw caution to the wind in a dramatic last quarter, employing a fly keeper for NINE minutes as they chased the remarkable. Glasgow topscorer Jodie Henry pulled one back, but it wasn’t to be. A well-deserved victory to New Zealand – will that inspire their men’s team who lock horns with Australia once more later today? Phwoar, imagine that.It’s been a strong morning for the nations already astride the podium with Australia, England and India grabbing the golds on offer.In the women’s cycling road race it was a terrific team performance from Australia whose six riders set and controlled the pace for most of the 112km course at Currumbin to allow Chloe Hosking to grab the gold ahead of New Zealand’s Georgia Williams and Wales’ Danielle Rowe. Hosking acknowledged the support of her team in a pretty honest and raw interview post race:There’s been shooting gold for England as David Luckman has won the Queen’s Prize Inidual ahead of compatriot Parag Patel with the bronze and Australian Jim Bailey taking silver. Look, I’ll level with you entirely here, I have no idea how that event works – shooting aficionados feel free to set me straight on that front via email or twitter if you’re not learning, you’re not living.The women’s boxing gold medal bouts are underway and local favourite Anja Stridsman has delighted the home fans at packed into the Oxenford Studios, with an unanimous victory in the women’s 60kg ision. England’s Lisa Whiteside and India’s Mery Kom have also been victorious in the 51kg and \u0026lt48kg isions, with Northern Ireland settling for a brace of silvers.But to live action now, and uhoh – we’ve got something special unfolding in the hockey.Selamat datang, namaste, jambo! It’s the penultimate day of events in the Gold Coast and we’ve still plenty in store.If you missed last night, there was a very unexpected celebration of one of Australia’s lawn bowlers went ‘beast mode’, Katarina Johnson-Thompson conquered fatigue to back up her Birmingham exploits and women’s rugby sevens kicked off in fine fettle. Here’s what’s still to come on day 10. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.We’ve got a busy day-programme of athletics today, with women’s high jump leaping into action from 2.25pm (local), men’s javelin and triple jump, 4x100m relays, and women’s 5000m. From about 4pm it’s the men’s 1500m and then we’re into 4x400m relays – so an absolute bumper session with nine gold on the line.We’ve got England v Jamaica in the netball semi-final from 3pm, and men’s trap shooting shortly thereafter, there’s medals in the table tennis and wrestling and then around 5pm a ding-dong in the netball as perennial rivals Australia and New Zealand duke it out.There are medals up for grabs in the badminton, more rugby sevens action – I hope you’ve told family you’re at work and work you’re hanging out with family, because today is going to require some serious concentration!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18b7645e69f3dd47e21e24cac5517b1676b35db/13_62_3316_1989/master/3316.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=88bd69962244abfcf459280a7f53a6e2 1240w","title":"google loses right to be forgotten case","story":"Businessman wins legal action to force removal of search results about past convictionA businessman has won his legal action to remove search results about a criminal conviction in a landmark “right to be forgotten” case that could have wide-ranging repercussions.The ruling was made by Mr Justice Warby in London on Friday. The judge rejected a similar claim brought by a second businessman who was jailed for a more serious offence. The claimant who lost, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s the claimant who won, known as NT2, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiracy to intercept communications. NT1 was jailed for four years, while NT2 was jailed for six months.Granting an appeal in the case of NT1, the judge added: “It is quite likely that there will be more claims of this kind, and the fact that NT2 has succeeded is likely to reinforce that.”Both men demanded that Google remove search results mentioning the cases for which they were convicted. These include links to web pages published by a national newspaper and other media. Google refused their request and the men took the company to the high court.The decision in NT2’s favour could have implications for other convicted criminals and those who want embarrassing stories about them erased from the web. Warby ruled out any damages payment, however.Explaining his decision, the judge said NT1 continued to mislead the public, whereas NT2 had shown remorse. He also took into account the submission that NT2’s conviction did not concern actions taken by him in relation to “consumers, customers or investors”, but rather in relation to the invasion of privacy of third parties.He said his key conclusion in relation to NT2’s claim was that “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability”. In the case of NT1, however, the judge was scathing about the claimant’s position since leaving prison. “He has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters,” he said.“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimising the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.”In 2014 the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engine firms can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy.At a high court hearing in February, Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing NT1, told the high court that the visibility of the articles on the search engine caused “distress and upset” to his client.Tomlinson, who is also chairman of the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living from commercial lending and funding a property developer.“Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson said. He added that many people engaged in misdeeds when they were young and if the misdeeds were constantly brought to the attention of others then they would permanently have a negative effect.NT1’s conviction was now spent, Tomlinson continued, and the law was designed to allow for the rehabilitation of offenders so they could go on to lead normal lives.But Antony White QC, representing Google, argued the ECJ’s “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”.White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”.NT2, in a separate hearing, also argued that his conviction was legally spent and he therefore had a right to be forgotten. Google resisted taking down search results linking to articles including reports on his financial affairs, his conviction and interviews given by him several years later containing his account of the circumstances surrounding his conviction.A Google spokesperson said: “We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information. We are pleased that the court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

But at the same time, we must respect neighbours’ opinions.”Klimt said the work would stay up for a short while so everyone interested could experience it. Although some people had welcomed the penis as an “important part of the debate about sexuality, body and gender”, others – especially neighbours – had “received it less well and perceived it as offensive”, she said. Atrium Ljungberg has allowed a collective of local artists, Kollektivet Livet, free rein to decorate the apartment block wall as it sees fit since 2008. The murals usually stay in place for at least six months before a new one is commissioned.Falkholt said at the unveiling that she hoped her blue penis would be better received in Stockholm than a similar pink one was when it appeared on the side of an apartment building in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in December. The New York work was painted over within three days instead of the intended three weeks after similar complaints from locals. But Falkholt said on Wednesday she thought the reaction in her native Sweden would be different. “I think perhaps it will be allowed to remain here, people will get the message and let it take its place in the debate,” she said. “I think there’s more intellectual space to discuss the subject, in a nuanced way.” She said she liked to think of the Stockholm painting – titled Fuck the World – as “a reincarnation”. Falkholt could not be reached for comment on Friday.

Earlier this week, his grandson James followed in his footsteps to win a bronze in the 1m springboard.Reid won with a personal best score, ahead of two Australians, and was in tears when the result was confirmed.Grace Reid with her gold medalShe said: “I just loved every second of that. That was unbelievable. My primary goal was to go out and actually enjoy what I do, so job done as far as I’m concerned.“Seeing as this was my third Commonwealth Games, I actually came in with quite a lot of pressure on my shoulders. “I haven’t been sleeping and eating as much as normal because I have been really nervous.

The country’s biggest total came four years in Glasgow when, as hosts, the team won 53 medals.However, it is already well ahead of its best previous overseas medal haul of 29, in Melbourne in 2006.Syria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest news\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Mr McCabe says that when he believed his answers to the inspector general were misunderstood, he went back and tried to correct them.His lawyer says the inspector general unfairly tried to conclude its work before Mr McCabe could retire with a full pension.The report gave additional fodder for President Donald Trump\u0027s public attacks on Mr McCabe.On Friday night, the president tweeted: \u0026quotDOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster.

Pictured is an RAF Tornado GR4 landing at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could be deployed against the Syrian governmentAir strikes carried out by the US, UK and France against the Syrian regime have been welcomed by their Western allies.President Donald Trump on Friday night addressed the American people to announce that military action had been taken in Syria, with the support of Britain and France.Three targets were chosen, to strike at the heart of a regime held culpable by the West for a chemical gas attack in a suburb of Damascus last week, that killed more than 70 people and injured dozens more.Theresa May, the Prime Minister, insisted that the strikes were \u0026quotlimited\u0026quot and were not intended to drive regime change.Here is how the world reacted:Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has ruled out Canadian participation in the strikes but said that Canada supports the decision by its allies in the US, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotCanada condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in last week\u0027s attack in eastern Ghouta, Syria,\u0026quot said Mr Trudeau, in a statement issued from Lima, Peru, where he is attending the Summit of the Americas.\u0026quotCanada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u0027s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people.\u0026quotWe will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u0026quotEarlier on Friday, Canada became the latest country to lay the blame for a deadly chemical-weapons attack in Syria last week at Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s doorstep, despite Russian suggestions to the contrary.\u0026quotWhen it comes to this use of chemical weapons, it is clear to Canada that chemical weapons were used and that they were used by the Assad regime,\u0026quot said Chrystia Freeland, Canadian foreign minister.Australia, a staunch ally of the US and a member of the Five Eyes security alliance, was not a part of the attacks on Damascus and Homs, but issued a statement lending its support to the coalition’s actions.Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, said in a statement jointly issued with the foreign and defence ministers: “The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances is illegal and utterly reprehensible.“The Assad regime must not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity.”Mr Turnbull said the strikes were “a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response”.“They send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.”The head of Nato expressed his support for Western strikes in Syria.Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: \u0026quotI support the actions taken by the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotThis will reduce the regime\u0027s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons.\u0026quotIran warned of \u0026quotregional consequences\u0026quot following the wave of punitive strikes in Syria.\u0026quotThe United States and its allies have no proof and, without even waiting for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to take a position, have carried out this military attack,\u0026quot said the foreign ministry in a statement.They \u0026quotare responsible for the regional consequences of this adventurist action,\u0026quot it added.Iran is the key backer alongside Russia of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, providing military advisors and \u0026quotvolunteer\u0026quot ground forces.Tehran officials have said Western powers are using last week\u0027s alleged chemical attack on a rebel-held stronghold as an excuse to undermine the Syrian government\u0027s recent successes on the battlefield.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday called for restraint and for countries to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation in Syria after the United States, France and Britain carried out strikes.Guterres delayed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to deal with the aftermath of the military action.\u0026quotI urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,\u0026quot Guterres said in a statement.\u0026quotAny use of chemical weapons is abhorrent. The suffering it causes is horrendous,\u0026quot Guterres said.The UN chief said it was important to act in line with the UN charter and international law.He urged the UN Security Council to agree on establishing an inquiry that would identify the perpetrators of chemical attacks.Please review our commenting policySyria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest newsComment: On this day in 1865: John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln at Ford\u0026#39s Theatre, WashingtonComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Fourteen days of strikes have already hit 65 universities since 22 February.But members of the UCU voted to call off more action after bosses at Universities UK agreed a joint panel would be set up to reassess the pension issue.The news was welcomed by the National Union of Students (NUS), with estimates suggesting up to 1 million students were affected by previous walkouts.Shakira Martin, NUS president, said: “We are pleased to see a deal has been reached.

Universities UK had said the alterations would help make up a £6bn deficit.But, with the proposals now dropped, members of the UCU voted almost two to one to stop more walkouts and instead reopen negotiations. There was a record 63.5 per cent turn out, the union said.Sally Hunt, UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.”And she added: “We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.“UCU has more work to do to ensure that the agreement delivers the security in retirement that university staff deserve.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
