To avoid French inheritance taxes of up to 35 per cent. In a paper published in American journal Rejuvenation Research, Zak compiled a dossier of 17 pieces of biographical evidence supporting his \u0027switch theory\u0027, including inexplicable physical differences between the young and old Jeanne.         A Russian mathematician called Nikolay Zak recently alleged it was not Jeanne (right) who had died in 1997, but her daughter, Yvonne (left)He certainly has a point that Jeanne always seemed bizarrely youthful. Even at 90, she was slim, fit and lithe. When she hit her century, she was still cycling everywhere in smartly cut suits, heeled shoes and seamed stockings.It was only when she reached 110 — after climbing on to a table to try to unfreeze the boiler with a candle and starting a small fire — that she moved out of her grand apartment and into a nearby retirement home.Unsurprisingly, the French are very protective of Jeanne\u0027s memory. How dare this Russian upstart besmirch their homegrown \u0027Doyenne de l\u0027humanité\u0027 (oldest woman in the world).In fairness, it was a matter of pride rather than any fondness for the woman concerned. For Jeanne — a strident, bossy, haughty woman — had never been hugely liked.The daughter of a shipbuilder, she had led an unremarkable, cosseted life: she went to school, learned the piano and \u0027prepared for marriage\u0027 to her cousin, Fernand Calment, heir to a large drapery business in town.She used to recall that, when she was a teenager, van Gogh — who was painting in Arles — came to her family\u0027s store to buy canvases and her father waited on him.(Zak makes much of this — for Jeanne\u0027s father was a shipbuilder and the dry goods store in question actually belonged to her husband\u0027s family.)Meanwhile, marriage brought comfort, a houseful of servants and time to pursue her hobbies of tennis, roller-skating, cycling and hunting wild boar.But her daughter, Yvonne, was sickly and, in 1934, died — or not, as Zak would have it — leaving a husband, Colonel Joseph Billot, and a seven-year-old son, Frederic (Freddy), whom Jeanne and Fernand took in.         Zak insisted that Jeanne (pictured) seemed far too youthful to be 122Eight years later, Fernand died, too, and Jeanne and Freddy moved in with her son-in-law.(By Zak\u0027s reckoning, this was Yvonne moving back in with her own husband!)In 1963, she lost them, too. In January, Joseph died after a long illness and, in August, Freddy was killed in a car crash.In 1969, when she was 94, Jeanne sold her apartment to her lawyer under the French en viager system, where the buyer makes regular payments on a property in which the seller continues to live until they die.Or not, in Jeanne\u0027s case. She lived on, and on.When the lawyer died in 1995, he\u0027d paid more than £150,000 — far more than the property was worth — and never moved in.Even then, Jeanne didn\u0027t let his family off the payments, simply saying: \u0027In life, one sometimes makes bad deals.\u0027In the nursing home, where she was nicknamed \u0027La Commandante\u0027 by nurses, Jeanne insisted she be treated as though she were a guest in a hotel.As every birthday passed, so her fame grew worldwide. And she embraced it with enthusiasm.\u0027I waited 110 years to be famous. I mean to make the most of it,\u0027 she once said.She quit smoking when she was 117, declaring that, after nearly 100 years, it had \u0027become a bit of a habit\u0027. But she never gave up her daily glass of port.Finally, on August 4, 1997, after 122 years, five months and 14 days, Jeanne ran out of steam.She went to her grave having burned all the family documents two years previously, and was buried with Yvonne. She was the oldest validated human in history, finally at rest. Or perhaps not.Zak\u0027s theory can certainly be challenged.

After all, in the two decades since Jeanne\u0027s death, no one else has come close to her record.Team Jeanne insist their heroine was simply unique.She lived well, they say, was never ill or overweight, regularly exercised her mind and body and attributed her youthful complexion to a daily dab of olive oil and a puff of powder.But, in truth, it\u0027s a mystery that will endure for ever."},{"url":null,"title":"Chocolate company bosses planning launch vegan friendly version classic Dairy Milk bar","story":"Share this article But it has yet to find a dairy substitute that also caters for people with nut allergies, the Sunday Telegraph reported.It comes as more consumers opt for vegetarian diets and baker Greggs introduced a vegan sausage roll last year to great acclaim.Cadbury\u0027s dropped its decades-long \u0027glass and a half\u0027 slogan – the amount of milk in each bar – in 2010 to comply with EU metric regulations.US firm Mondelez, which also owns Toblerone, admitted it was looking at a plant-based version.          It comes as more consumers opt for vegetarian diets and baker Greggs introduced a vegan sausage roll last year to great acclaimA spokesman said: \u0027We\u0027re always listening to our consumers, so we can develop and provide people with a greater choice. \u0027This includes looking at a plant-based Cadbury Dairy Milk bar. However, we have no immediate plans to launch.\u0027We are only interested in launching a new vegan product that retains the texture and taste that our consumers love.\u0027It brought out a version with 30 per cent less sugar last year.

The portrait of Thomas Cromwell that began with Wolf Hall (2009) and continued with Bring Up the Bodies (2012) now concludes with a novel of epic proportions, every bit as thrilling, propulsive, darkly comic and stupendously intelligent as its predecessors. “Concludes” is perhaps not the word, for there is no tone of finality. Cromwell, Lord Privy Seal, deputy head of the church in England, chief minister, second man of the realm, Cremuel, my Lord Cromell, Crumb to friends, has a great deal of business to do, through 900 pages, before we contemplate endings. The heights of his power are all before us, and though he likes ladders he prefers to think of wings.Bring Up the Bodies closed with bloodshed and wreckage. “But it’s useful wreckage, isn’t it?” and now Cromwell uses it, strenuously remodelling catastrophes as opportunities. Over four years, 1536-40, his tasks include the seemingly impossible. He must reconcile Lady Mary to her father the king, bring down two of the most powerful families in Europe, turn monks into money, prevent imperial invasion, organise a new queen. Taking opponents in his grasp like the snake whose poisoned bite he once survived, he must manoeuvre his arch-enemies the Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner. Cromwell lives these years with henchmen at his back, and guards at every door. “The times being what they are, a man may enter the gate as your friend and change sides while he crosses the courtyard.” As for clothes, best try a reversible garment: “one never knows, is it dying or dancing?”We can already tell the shape of this book. We see that the crowd dispersing after Anne Boleyn’s execution in the opening pages (“time for a second breakfast”) will gather again at its close. Working with and against our foreknowledge, Mantel keeps us on the brink, each day to be invented. “Scaramella’s off to war,” hums Cromwell, a tune from his Italian youth. You need a war-song to go into dinner. This is what it’s like to be at the centre of power in Tudor England, and also a particular understanding of what it is, anywhere, to be alive.The Mirror \u0026amp the Light is generously self-sufficient – to read this alone would hardly be skimping: it is four or five books in itself. But it also continues, deepens, and revises its forebears, negotiating with its past as does Cromwell with his. A spring lightly touched opens corridors into earlier books. Unlock the “room called Christmas” now and its past leaps out: this is where the doomed lutenist Mark Smeaton shrieked through the night among festive decorations that appeared, in his terror, as implements of torture. We know our way around Austin Friars and what these walls have seen. “My past pads after me, paws on the flagstones,” thinks Cromwell, who builds new houses and watches old ghosts enter. He knows the power of palimpsests. His Reformation involves the whitewashing of walls, but he sees how old faces show through from underneath. The Mirror \u0026amp the Light is startlingly fresh in every moment, a new-made story with predecessors close enough to bleed through the pages.Mantel’s Cromwell, now in his 50s, keeps the same daunting schedules as ever through 18-hour days. Lawyer, banker, chief diplomat, he is master of the grand scheme and every last memorandum. “Bear in mind,” he tells a friend and spy, “my field of interest is very wide.” He knows the price of wool and alum, and market values in the court’s “inner economy” of gossip and shame. He has drained the roads, reintroduced beavers, grafted better plums. And still his life depends entirely on Henry’s favour. Should the king die, or withdraw his love, all is lost. A moment’s inattention and the structure falls: hence the difficulty of sleep, hence the disaster of illness in which, through absence, one loses the advantage. “You are one man,” says Margaret Pole: “Who follows you? Only carrion crows.”She is restating the terms of class warfare. The central conflict between the self-made blacksmith’s son and his aristocratic opponents (Norfolks, Courtenays, Poles) intensifies along with Cromwell’s power. As his chief of staff Wriothesley correctly observes, “The higher you rise in the king’s service, the more you mention the low place you come from.” His country, too, is obsessed by the relationship of class and power. The labouring rebels who march in the Pilgrimage of Grace uprising cry vengeance on the “vile blood” of any lowborn who tries to rule them. In Cromwell’s rearrangement of hierarchies, intelligence is all those not clever enough to save themselves are not worth sympathy. Yet if he is the figurehead of a new meritocracy, he badly compromises his position as he funnels influence into his own family, bringing a new dynasty into being.Though many readers have responded to the modern secularity of her fictional Cromwell, Mantel has always been firm about the strength of his religious conviction. Here she puts the evangelical cause at the centre of his life’s work. He is a heretic, and acts on it, risking everything for the gospel translation he wants to see in every parish and for his country’s alliance with Europe’s Protestant centres. Among the book’s most complex and fascinating subjects is the character of the Reformation that he passionately apprehends.Modern times may sharpen our sense of Cromwell’s internationalism. If his England is to prosper, it must join every conversation across the courts and marketplaces of the continent. He employs in his household the best linguists to be found. As a boy in the kitchens of the Frescobaldi banking house, he was promoted upstairs for his quick wits and knowledge of the English used on the docks and streets Wolsey employed him for his Italian now he calls on ruffians and survivors from across the world to work for him.As much as this is a book about statecraft, international relations, class, faith and power, it must count, too, among the most penetrating studies of professional friendship: the complicated, unequal relations of masters and servants, tutors and proteges, kings and their ministers. “Henry and Cromwell. Cromwell and Henry”: they step apart from the court to talk alone, needing each other in desperate though different ways. Cromwell’s most vehement love and loyalty, however, belongs to a dead man, Thomas Wolsey: his teacher, employer and elected father. It is the quietest but perhaps the most acute calamity of the novel when Wolsey’s ghost ceases to talk, leaving him “without company, without advice”. He can but turn to those he in turn has sponsored. Rafe Sadler, Thomas Wriothesley: “he has trained them, encouraged them, written them as versions of himself”. Watchfully, appreciatively, quelling hindsight, the novel asks what they have learned.“There is nothing against the recreation of the dead,” Cromwell says, “as long as they are plausible.” He has just employed Holbein to paint the past kings of England, inventing their unknown faces. It’s as if he is glancing towards Mantel, signalling permission. Where evidence survives, she uses it where there is silence, she offers deeply informed guesses about the world as it looked to him. It’s characteristically bracing of her to consider the horror of finding that one’s life is wrongly told: Cromwell has forced on many victims an “estrangement of self” and suffers in his turn from contortions of evidence, wilful misreadings. Of the book’s many mirrors, this is the most disturbing: the glass in which the truth of your life is stolen away and reconfigured. Mantel’s project is to offer a clearer reflection, a more plausible hypothesis, a more telling illumination.She is still exuberantly rethinking what novels can do. Not since Bleak House has the present tense performed such magic. The narrative voice rides at times like a spirit or angel on thermals of vitality, catching the turning seasons, the rhythms of work and dreams, cities and kitchens and heartbeats. Mantel did not have much to learn about scene-setting or dramatic timing, but her involvement in the staging of Wolf Hall, and the experience of watching the television adaptation, may have contributed to an ever-finer honing of dialogue. In a room at the Tower, in the time it takes to burn two candles, a prisoner’s silence mounts towards confession. On a thundery midsummer night, talking quietly in a garden tower at Canonbury, eating strawberries while the moon comes up, two men arrange the future “a hair’s-breadth at a time”.Endings, insists Cromwell, are opportunities. What begins now is the rereading. For this is a masterpiece that will keep yielding its riches, changing as its readers change, going forward with us into the future.• The Mirror \u0026amp the Light is published by 4th Estate (RRP £25).

She is a senior non-executive on the Bank’s board, known as the Court of Directors, and chairs the audit and risk committee.Criticism of Thompson’s role is embarrassing for Mark Carney, who steps down as governor next month to become Boris Johnson’s special adviser for the crucial Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November.Britain is hosting the climate conference as governments come under pressure to explain how they plan to cut fossil fuel emissions, especially from the widespread use of oil and oil products such as plastic.Carney has also been appointed as UN special envoy for climate action and finance, replacing the billionaire Michael Bloomberg in the part-time pro bono climate action role.Rosie Rogers, the head of climate finance at Greenpeace UK, said the Bank was “central to tackling the climate emergency” and that Carney needed to be “making the best decisions possible for the planet free from the influence of the fossil fuel industry”.Hannah McKinnon, the director, energy transitions and futures programme at the OCI, said: “Central banks are charged with overseeing and regulating one of the greatest transitions of our time: the end of the fossil fuel economy. It’s a conflict of interest for the Bank of England to have fossil fuel executives on its Court of Directors.”Rachel Kennerley, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “While the world grapples with the severity of the climate crisis and young people take to the streets for their future, our country’s finances remain too tightly aligned with climate-wreaking oil and gas companies. Climate breakdown needs to be fought in every arena which can only mean cutting ties between financial institutions and dirty oil companies.”The Bank of England is known to be concerned to protect its environmental credentials after converting to renewable energy at its Threadneedle Street headquarters and introducing schemes to reduce business travel by its staff and recycle banknotes.Carney is most closely associated with a UN-backed campaign that aims to encourage businesses to show how they will reduce their carbon footprint over the next two decades to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C of pre-industrial levels.Earlier this month, Carney said that when world leaders meet in Scotland for UN-led climate talks they needed to show they had a plan to reduce carbon emissions.“It’s not just green assets and estment campaigns or certain things are so brown or black. Every company ultimately has to have a plan for a transition and what the opportunities are and where the risks are,” he said.As chief executive of Drax, Thompson was applauded for switching the electricity generator from coal to biofuels and introducing measures to reduce harmful gas emissions. Drax has pledged to be carbon negative by 2030.Tullow Oil is a £550m oil and gas company that explores and produces oil at sites in Kenya, Ghana and Uganda. It has also explored for oil off the coast of Guyana.Thompson stepped up from her role as non-executive chair of Tullow in December after she and other non-executives ousted the chief executive and the head of exploration for poor performance.Tullow has pledged to reduce the level of CO2 emissions per tonne of hydrocarbon it extracts from its wells, but the most recent figure for 2018 – 139 tonnes per 1,000 tonnes of hydrocarbon produced, while lower than in 2017 – is higher than 2015.The Bank of England and Tullow Oil declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c149601d1f7ddbe3786b83682e31409d21da01b5/0_322_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2154f891afcb48272443a9e8aa0806bf","title":"brexit deal fishing cornwall devon trade talks europe","story":"Fishing was a powerful factor in the case for leaving the EU. On the eve of crucial trade talks, the Observer finds optimism tempered by caution on the quays of Devon and CornwallNeil Watson was eight or nine when his dad took him out to sea for the first time. Soon he was earning his first pocket money by washing fish boxes on the quay at Brixham in south Devon. Three years after he started crewing, he got his skipper’s ticket and eventually he bought his own boat. For 30 years, he regularly spent seven days at sea followed by one night off, only stopping when his boat sank two years ago.“I fished through good times and bad times. Fishing’s like riding a wave – one minute you’re up the top, and the next you’re down in the trough,” he said. Now Watson works at Brixham’s fish market, one of the largest in England, where £40m of fish was sold last year across the UK and Europe. A fisherman’s life is brutal, he said, but he badly misses the camaraderie.Along the coast, in the picturesque Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey, Andrew Trevarton, a fisherman for 37 years, hasn’t been out to sea for two weeks because of atrocious weather. Nevertheless, Trevarton is feeling cautiously optimistic about the future. “You have to be an optimist to go fishing in the first place,” he said.In 2016, Trevarton and Watson voted for Brexit, along with the vast majority of UK fishermen. The image of rugged men in sea-slicked oilskins braving weather and waves to put food on the island nation’s plates was a powerful emotional factor in the case for leaving the EU. After decades of battling over Brussels-set quotas, which allow European fleets to take a lion’s share of fish from waters around the UK, the idea of taking back control was irresistible.Much, therefore, is riding on trade talks that are due to begin at the start of March. According to Nigel Farage, fishing will be the “acid test” of Brexit. Boris Johnson reinforced this view in a key speech on EU trade negotiations earlier this month. Any agreement must ensure that “British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats”, said the prime minister, who visited Brixham last summer to meet fishermen and sample hake and chips on the quayside.The timetable is extremely tight, with the EU saying that an agreement on fishing must be reached by the end of July, and the talks will be tough. A fishing deal is a precondition to a wider trade agreement, the EU has said – and some European politicians and officials have suggested that Britain’s access to the EU’s lucrative financial services markets could depend on EU fleets being allowed to continue to fish in UK waters on the same basis as now.At the heart of the talks are issues of access and quotas. Under the EU’s common fisheries policy (CFP), all member states have equal access to EU waters apart from the first 12 nautical miles from the coast. At the end of this year, the UK will become an independent coastal state, operating under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the CFP. As such, Britain will have control over an “exclusive economic zone” up to 200 nautical miles off its shores – some of the most bountiful seas in the world.Expectations among British fishermen are high, but history has taught them to be wary. In Mevagissey, memories of what happened in the 1970s when Ted Heath was negotiating the UK’s entry into the European common market are part of local folklore. “We were traded off, basically thrown to the wall, sacrificed for other sectors,” said Trevarton.Almost half a century later, they want redress. “We’re hoping politicians will recognise the great injustice done to the industry back then. We believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put it right,” said Trevarton.He and Ingram were at pains to stress that they were not looking for European boats to be excluded from UK waters, pointing out that the UK fishing fleet doesn’t have the capacity to land the entire permitted quotas. But, they say, they want the cake ided up more fairly.Trevarton, who is chairman of the Mevagissey Fisherman’s Association, listed their objectives: control over UK waters, a greater quota share, priority for UK vessels in inshore waters, and a management structure combining industry representatives and scientific experts.Another point of contention is the EU’s demand that any deal negotiated between March and July is permanent. Britain wants annual talks.“An annual agreement allows you to be active and nimble,” said Jim Portus, of the South Western Fish Producers’ Organisation. “It can reflect the movement and biology of fish, the needs and aspirations of fishermen, and bend and sway with fisheries science. The CFP had enormous fault lines running through it, but it was only amendable after 10 years.” Norway had been negotiating annually with the EU for 40 years, he pointed out.Taking fish out of the sea is only part of the overall picture. About three-quarters of the seafood landed by UK fishermen is sold to EU countries – a trade reliant on being fast and frictionless. Brexit is likely to mean more customs delays and inspections – and if Britain restricts access to UK waters, the EU could impose tariffs on British exports. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French minister of Europe and foreign affairs, warned last week that if European boats were barred from UK waters, France would press for British trawlers to be prevented from selling their catches on the continent.Some British fishermen fear their militant French counterparts could simply take direct action to prevent fish landed in the UK being brought into French ports. Barrie Deas of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations (NFFO) said he fully expected blockades. “French fishermen have done it for much less. I would imagine there will be disruption.” There is a long history of fishing skirmishes, most recently between the UK and France over scallops in 2018. But, unlike the French, “we aren’t naturally a confrontational society,” said Trevarton.In an indication that such concerns are being taken seriously, it was reported this month that Britain has recently beefed up the Royal Navy’s Fisheries Protection Squadron with two extra ships, two aerial surveillance aircraft and 35 extra enforcement officers to police UK waters. A further 22 ships will be on standby.Some argue that the fishing industry has distorted perceptions by depicting itself as beleaguered and struggling – a strategy that has allowed it to punch above its weight. Chris Davies, a former Lib Dem MEP and chair of the European parliament’s fisheries committee, said there was a national myth of a “small fishing boat with a couple of guys on board, going out from a little Cornish harbour at dawn and returning at sunset”.Rather than focusing on who catches the fish, the key question was how many fish there are to be caught, Davies said. “The industry and the government should make the strongest commitment to sustainability. The last 10 years have been pretty good – stocks are stable and in some cases increasing. The most important thing is not to go back to the days of overfishing.”For the NFFO, fishing as a symbol of British sovereignty is welcome. “I don’t think fishing has ever been stronger politically,” said Deas. “The idea that past wrongs need to be righted is powerful. I think it would be extremely difficult for the government to come back from talks with fishing having been sold out again.”He added: “We may not know the full implications of Brexit for years, or decades. But by the end of 2020, we’ll know if fishing has a more positive future.”Nevertheless, any Brexit idend would not be enjoyed equally across the sector, he conceded. “It will vary by area, by fleet, by fishery. There will be winners, and there will be lesser winners.”On the quaysides of Devon and Cornwall, alongside hope there is a deep mistrust of politicians. At Brixham fish market last week, as boxes of sole, monkfish, plaice, brill and scallops were auctioned, loaded with ice and packed on to lorries, Neil Watson said the prime minister had “promised the earth” on his visit to the harbour last year. “I’m hoping Boris will be strong, but we know there could be a slap around the ear coming.”In Mevagissey, Andrew Trevarton was also worried about being “sold down the line again”. He said: “The biggest fear within our industry is that the government will buckle under EU pressure and maintain the status quo. I hope that anything that comes from negotiations will be an improvement on what we have now. After all, could it be any worse? But it means putting our faith in politicians to push this through, and that’s always risky.”The 70 registered fishing boats in Mevagissey’s harbour belonged to local family businesses, he said. “This place absolutely relies on a vibrant fishing industry. Our tourism is built on the back of fishing – people come to see a working harbour.”Mevagissey is unusual in the relatively high number of young men entering the industry.

Our mission is to rewrite the narrative of women in maritime by raising visibility and awareness.”Matthews, who is from New Zealand and joined the superyacht industry as a stewardess when she was 18, said: “I’ve got to be honest with you – it’s tough to get a job, full stop. This industry is highly competitive with so many people wanting to work in it. And being a female wanting to work in a more male-dominated role can be very challenging.”Matthews said raising awareness that women can be captains and chief engineers was a key part of the campaign. “Some people may say, ‘Why would I consider a woman to be my deckhand? I’ve never seen it. She is obviously a stewardess.’ It all comes back to the core perceptions people have about what jobs people should do based on their gender, not what they could be good at.“It’s unconscious bias. It can even happen to me when I see a female captain – I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s so cool.’ But it shouldn’t be, it should be a normal thing.”The women said their campaign was inspired by Kate McCue, the first woman to captain a “mega” cruise ship, and similar efforts to raise the visibility of female commercial airline pilots.McCue has built up a following of more than 100,000 people on instagram detailing her life as captain of Celebrity Edge, a $1bn 130,000-tonne cruise ship with capacity for 2,900 passengers.Ambrose, 32, from Chichester, West Sussex, said a core part of the She of the Sea campaign was to let schoolchildren know that working as an officer or engineer on a superyacht sailing the world was a viable career no matter their gender – if they worked hard at maths and science.“The only way to really change things is to get people enthused when they are young,” Ambrose said. “Our phrase is, ‘If she can see it, she can be it,’ and we’re planning our own roadshow to schools in the UK and across the world to encourage girls to study science, maths and engineering so that they can take career paths like this.”The She of the Sea campaign also aims to connect and support women already working in the industry. “It’s about letting people know that they’re not alone, and we are here for each other,” Matthews said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47b93509cd6f468e33c21d151587a289d475c1d/0_342_1454_872/master/1454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9748f67e9d38c21620a0b51443527244","title":"tesco launches range of plasters to match different skin tones","story":"Supermarket’s own-brand product available in light, medium and dark shadesThe UK’s largest retailer Tesco is introducing a range of plasters to match different skin colours and better reflect racial and ethnic ersity.In a supermarket first, its new own-brand fabric plasters, available in light, medium and dark shades, go on sale in all 741 Tesco stores nationwide and online from Monday.Tesco developed the plasters after a member of staff spotted a now-viral tweet last year, when a black American man described his emotional response when he first used a plaster on his cut finger that matched his skin tone.His tweet prompted a flurry of comments from other users, highlighting how significant the issue of representative plaster tones is for those in black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Some said their memories of putting on plasters as children were when they were first made aware of race.The thread, which received more than 500,000 likes, even attracted the attention of actor John Boyega, who posted his own experience of “nude” plasters while filming Star Wars.The product idea was brought to the attention of senior Tesco team members who accelerated its launch. The development of the plasters was supported by the BAME at Tesco staff network, who helped with testing and feedback and had an input into the product’s final design.Paulette Balson, the chair of the network, said: “No UK supermarket had ever stocked plasters in a range of skin tones before and we saw this as an opportunity for Tesco to lead the charge and make a genuine difference. Through our research, we know how emotive a product like this can be. For example, one colleague reported that their child had felt self-conscious wearing a plaster on their face to school recently, because it didn’t match their skin tone and stood out.”In the UK, there is little product choice from mainstream retailers. Boots does not stock plasters in multiple tones, although it does sell transparent ones, which can be used on all skin colours. Specialist brands can be bought online but they are relatively expensive, while the Stickyskin range was launched in the UK nearly 10 years ago.Nicola Robinson, health, beauty and wellness director at Tesco, commented: “As one of the largest retailers in the UK, we understand that we have a responsibility to ensure our products reflect the ersity of our customers and colleagues.“We believe the launch of our new skin tone plaster range is an important step and a move that we hope will be replicated by other retailers and supermarkets across the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43889542fdcbbdd48498a2ab03198999ea5f0a2/0_39_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcc979ea215e6b84fd0de21cc2cd1081","title":"uk public spending to top 1tn a year thinktank forecasts","story":"Boris Johnson is planning to ramp up government borrowing to spend more than £1tn a year, increasing the size of the British state to make it bigger than at any point under the 10-year premiership of Labour’s Tony Blair.Analysis from The Resolution Foundation predicts government spending will rise above the £1tn mark for the first time in history by 2023-24. The report, published on Monday, comes as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to deliver what is widely expected to be one of the most expansionary Conservative budgets in a generation.Jack Leslie, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the plans marked a major shift for the traditionally small-state Tory party. “The chancellor’s big-spending plans to ‘level up’ the country through infrastructure projects will lead to a bigger state than at any point under Tony Blair,” he added.However, the thinktank warned that the money for extra spending would probably require tax increases unless Sunak broke budget rules drawn up by his predecessor, Sajid Javid, before the former chancellor’s dramatic resignation earlier this month.The drive by Johnson’s government to increase spending to close gaps between the richest and poorest regions of the country with greater investment in transport and major public works follows promises made at the election. Johnson’s party attacked Labour’s spending plans as reckless during the campaign, warning that the “cost” of a Jeremy Corbyn government would have been £1.2tn.Any extra spending would still not undo a decade of cuts under the Conservatives, according to the foundation. Setting aside the department for health and social care, reversing even half the cuts to other departments would cost around £24bn. Extra spending on welfare to prevent further increases in child poverty would cost around £5bn more.Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the total value of activity in the economy over a given period of time.\u0026nbspPut simply, if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing if it is down, it is contracting. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are considered to be a recession.\u0026nbspGDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. Several key activities are not counted, such as unpaid work in the home.\u0026nbspThe ONS uses three measures that should, in theory, add up to the same number.• The value of all goods and services produced – known as the output or production measure.•\u0026nbspThe value of the income generated from company profits and wages – known as the income measure.•\u0026nbspThe value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas – known as the expenditure measure.Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which accounts for how the economy is performing after inflation.Britain\u0027s government statistics body, the\u0026nbspOffice for National Statistics, produces GDP figures on a monthly basis about six weeks after the end of the month. It compares the change in GDP month on month, as well as over a three-month period.\u0026nbspThe ONS warns that changes on the month can prove volatile, preferring to assess economic performance over a three-month period as the wider period can smooth over irregularities.\u0026nbspThe most closely watched GDP figures are for the four quarters of the year for the three months to March, June, September and December.The figures are usually revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and the government becomes available.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here. GDP per capita shows whether we are actually getting richer or poorer, by stripping out the impact of population changes. Richard PartingtonHe added: “We all know what happens when those facts are ignored: more borrowing, more debt.”With just over a fortnight until the crucial first budget of the new parliament set against the backdrop of Brexit, the thinktank said Sunak would probably be handed a modest boost from the Office for Budget Responsibility.While suggesting Sunak could just about stay within these constraints while lifting government spending beyond the levels seen under Blair’s Labour government between 1997 and 2007, the thinktank warned it would leave the chancellor with little room for manoeuvre.It said the headroom would be less than a third of the buffer earmarked by former tory chancellor Philip Hammond. Should public borrowing rise by more than expected, the government may need to raise around £19bn of additional tax income, it added. Leslie continued: “If the chancellor wants to increase spending on day-to-day public services in a fiscally responsible way he will have to change another of his party’s traditional priorities – lower taxes.He added: “Higher spending will require higher taxes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ea4217689c1aca74378b2f13ee0d05b3202cc04/0_73_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ae858250603cee544f4213c1e83bbb7","title":"dominic cummings reign shadowy world spads","story":"“You can be a successful poisoner, or you can be a famous poisoner. But you can’t be both.” That was Frank Dobson’s verdict on Alastair Campbell, whose tenure as a special adviser to Tony Blair still shapes how “spads” are thought of today. Not since the New Labour nomenklatura has a spad attracted as much attention as Dominic Cummings, whose dilettante grab-bag of Silicon Valley management techniques, huckster science and penchant for “weirdos and misfits” provides ample material for those wondering how Boris Johnson will govern.Cummings rode to power on invective against unelected elites, but he now occupies a position without a clear democratic mandate, effective limits on its power or obvious means of scrutiny. His mania for civil service reform and control of government prompted Sajid Javid’s resignation as chancellor, after Cummings insisted on replacing his advisers with a team run from No 10. He has similarly asserted his supremacy over spads working in other departments, expecting them to report on ministerial deviations or departmental slackness. Conventional political wisdom agrees with Dobson’s verdict in two respects: a spad’s role is highly politicised – poisoning opposition, internal and external, through spin – and can only be conducted in the shadows. Believe that, and you have cause for optimism: any aide who attracts more attention than his master is soon destined for the exit. A more sanguine judgment might be that Dobson’s axiom held true in the Blair years, where powerful spads did dirty work behind closed doors to ensure the appearance of a smooth governmental machine, but that Cummings’s propensity for disruption better serves an era with a greater appetite for political bloodsports. His victories in the referendum and election provide armour against doubters. There is an advantage, too, to an aide briefing vivid attacks from which the PM can then resile, as happened with the BBC last weekend: the institution is panicked, perhaps cowed, and Johnson keeps his hands clean, or even looks moderate by comparison – with Cummings as his lightning rod.Former spads bristle at their portrayal as shadowy manipulators. Most argue they fill a constitutional gap between Whitehall and Westminster, juggling the need for political commitment, media savvy and policy development in ways permanent officials cannot. Their status reflects that awkward gap: though formally temporary civil servants, they are exempted from the service’s requirement of political impartiality, and the rigours of its hiring process, but barred from direct decisions over public money and, at least nominally, from giving orders to permanent officials. Instead, they are personal appointees of their minister, with only the prime minister’s veto over their employment.The modern spad emerged under Harold Wilson, who hoped that politically committed socialist advisers could provide a counterweight to a lumbering and hidebound civil service, widely distrusted among Labour politicians after long exile in opposition. Early spads – largely economists – were few in number, and eminent in their fields, though hardly immune from internecine gossip and intrigue. It was under Blair that their numbers ballooned and tilted more obsessively towards media management.That shift was legitimate: the 24-hour news cycle made politics a media game that required sharp tactics. Blair’s presidential style extended the role further: a 1997 order empowered up to three of his advisers to manage permanent officials, a power not yet accorded to Cummings. It was hard to look at these figures – powerful, unelected, partisan and barely scrutinised – and not wonder about their democratic legitimacy, or how far they might influence elected politicians. Blair’s memoir describes agonised consultation with his advisers – Campbell, Jonathan Powell, David Miliband – over intervention in Kosovo the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who one might think ought to have had some input, goes unmentioned.Scandal tarnished spads during the Blair period: Jo Moore’s attempt to “bury bad news” on 911, Damian McBride’s routine attempts to smear the rivals of Gordon Brown, Campbell’s dossier-tampering enthusiasm for the Iraq War. But select committee inquiries and election pledges to reduce their number produced little change. The role of the spad is too useful. Its power is attractive: the major spad scandal of the Cameron years occurred when Adam Werritty posed as a spad without ever having been appointed. Tenure in spadland remains a technocrat’s easiest path to a safe seat in the Commons – leapfrogging the drudgery of local government, or a thankless battle in unwinnable constituencies – and a golden ticket to preferment in ministry, should an ex-spad choose that route.Spads are treated oddly. In evidence to one inquiry, a former Whitehall permanent secretary described them as having a “very significant influence” on government, with real autonomy and, if backed by their minister, real power. Even outside of Downing Street, many spads shape policy profoundly. But they are often regarded only as appendages of the minister, accountable just to them. They are too often hired in opaque processes favouring political insiders, with sketchy criteria for qualifications and minimal oversight, though paid from the public purse (£9.6m in the last report.). Checks on suitability for public office are absent, which explains how David Cameron employed former phone-hacker Andy Coulson as a media hitman.Their defenders argue rightly that most spads are essential to their department. Their mix of policy and media competence is hard to advertise for, and less tangible qualities that are deemed essential – loyalty and political commitment – are difficult to put in a checkbox form. Other defences are less convincing: that ministers will always sack egregious freelancers, or that ministers will carefully police their advisers for fear of their own job. Still less convincing is the argument that grubby men are needed for the grubby work of politics, and we should simply look the other way if it gets really bad, they can be booted out at the ballot box in a few years’ time – effectively an argument for temporary electoral dictatorship. The job’s mutability makes it difficult to regulate: raise the abuses by the most powerful spads and you will be met with the inarguable truth that those with policy specialisations are invaluable to their department – as if the one justifies the other. Proposals have been made for pre-appointment hearings, perhaps before a select committee, where MPs could raise concerns – but this was rejected as too cumbersome. Ministers are not required to hire spads purely on merit, a requirement that applies to the remainder of the civil service. The sheer number of spads, the personal nature of their appointments and the immediate need for them as soon as the government takes office would make such scrutiny unworkable.The spad role evolved out of the notorious adaptability of the British constitution yet, like all its haziest parts, it depends unwisely on the prudence, virtue and self-denial of its occupants – not traits easily discerned in Cummings. The recent hiring scandal surrounding Andrew Sabisky suggests that Cummings has strongly advocated for his own agenda, with at least the tacit approval of Johnson. But his replacement of Treasury aides and the reputed culture of fear among spads across Westminster suggests he hopes to remake the spad network as a channel of influence and control for Downing Street, eliminating internal governmental checks. It is a move that will likely fail and cause dysfunction: Whitehall is not easily bent to inidual wills, and spads are only one element in a machine with many powerful parts. Clare Short once spoke of prime ministerial spads as “people who live in the dark”. It is time they were dragged into the light.• James Butler is co-founder of Novara Media and a regular contributor to the London Review of Books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5f5f18297959b4d6836279fd084b09078a74c7/63_172_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f9d299601314ca75de92d2f8fb38de9","title":"teen magazines social media","story":"If there was anyone in need of clear information about the process of developing into a woman, it was my teenage self – raised by brothers and attending a faith-based school where discussions of sexual health were severely limited. Before social media the places where young people curious about their bodies and puberty could find information were few and far between. For people like me, teen magazines were the logical place to look for answers.Magazines for teenagers existed long before the 1990s and 2000s, but there was a boom in titles during those two decades. Mizz was first published in 1985 Bliss followed 10 years later, and CosmoGirl arrived in 1999. Young people had more expendable income, and groups like the Spice Girls rose to prominence in an era that prized the idea of female empowerment. Young women had a plethora of titles we could purchase ourselves. Hidden behind covers displaying members of Blue and free samples of Impulse were headlines about periods, body hair and relationships, all promising honest information derived from real-life experience.In reality, much of the content on offer was a mirage. Airbrushed cover girls with tiny waists, clear skin and glossy hair promoted a narrow and unrealistic version of teen beauty. Dating advice was largely restricted to heterosexual relationships. There seemed to be an outright refusal to write honestly about teenage bodies painful periods were described as ordinary, and young women were encouraged to remedy discomfort with a hot bath or chocolate ice cream. Little mention was made about the severity of pain or the potentially serious side-effects of hormonal contraception. If these were mentioned, they were presented as horror stories: “I got pregnant on the pill and didn’t know”, or “I went through menopause at 16”. Even gender-neutral issues like acne and stretch marks were handled tentatively, the latter going mostly unmentioned.These omissions betrayed an unease with addressing the subject of women’s bodies. By skirting over hormones, uteruses and all that can go wrong with them, teen magazines created a void that we filled with alternative answers. My generation was variously told that it’s normal to be in agony one week a month or for your contraception to destroy your mental health. I was left grossly unprepared for the fairly common realities of being a woman. Recently I asked friends if they had similar experiences: “Did anyone else hear of endometriosis, PCOS or cystitis in your teenage years and from teen magazines?” The responses were telling. “I learned about endometriosis when someone actually listened to me about how painful my periods were,” said one friend.The advice in these magazines has since been mocked and parodied. But if we can now recognise that the guidance was ridiculous, where were the initiatives to replace it with good information? Now, as then, it may simply be that too few people take teenage girls seriously, or care enough about women’s pain.Teen magazines did not survive the digital revolution, and by the 2010s most had become online-only or disappeared altogether. But their collapse didn’t put an end to misinformation, which has rippled across the internet and flourished on platforms that resonate with women – particularly Instagram, where a number of thread pages and accounts have become go-to bibles for young women. Trends such as clean eating, self-care and flat-tummy teas are mutations of the spurious information once available in teen magazines.In my work as a journalist and fact checker, I’ve seen teenagers tell each other that corrosive apple cider vinegar is good for the skin and that eating coconut oil can shorten your period and reduce bleeding. A deficit of accessible healthcare advice has resulted in a generation muddling together bad advice of the sort found in old teen magazines with expensive modern-day “fixes”. Shaped by the latest wellness fads, young women searching for reliable advice are fed a hodgepodge of digitised playground rumours, jade-egg mysticism and almond milk food vogues. Authority is less dependant on expertise or qualifications than follower count. Many of these accounts are nothing more than crowdsourced puberty manuals with a VSCO filter.There’s a tendency to eulogise teen magazines and demonise their digital successors. But this ignores the continuity between the poor guidance printed in these publications and the misleading advice available online today. One of the most pernicious effects of misinformation is everyday physical harm, the small mistakes made by young women resorting to bogus health tips in the absence of legitimate guidance. Today, despite an abundance of online sources, we seem no more willing to have frank and truthful discussions about women’s bodies – or women’s pain.• Rachael Krishna is a journalist at Full Fact"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3d403745378cdc83aedf4d00bc3836840a6c32/0_126_5193_3115/master/5193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb93f427e7a97d92f7e47067f4d82e04","title":"the guardian view on irans elections a closing door","story":"Iran’s election on Friday was a blow to moderates, a disappointment for conservative rulers and bad news for the region too. The result was largely ordained before anyone could cast a ballot. Hardliners appear to have swept the parliamentary contest – taking all 30 seats in Tehran – because the authorities ensured that they would.  Council, which is loosely under the control of the supreme leader, had disqualified around half of the thousands of candidates for the 290-seat body, including 90 serving members. While parliament’s powers are limited, it can impede the president and shape the political environment with a presidential race due next year, the result sets a course for conservative control of every branch of government – as seen during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s grim tenure.The frustrations found an outlet in November’s brutally suppressed protests – the third outbreak of unrest in as many years – and have only grown since then. The shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane, which Iran denied for days before admitting responsibility, prompted fresh protests and further exposed the rifts between and within the country’s institutions. Now a coronavirus outbreak, the deadliest outside China, is spreading in a country where the health system is already under immense strain due to sanctions. It will also deepen economic woes: on Sunday, Pakistan and Turkey announced they were closing their borders and Afghanistan said it was suspending all travel to and from the country.Domestic incompetence and corruption have unquestionably contributed to the hopelessness that so many Iranians feel today. But it is above all the Trump administration’s choices – in walking out of the JCPOA, imposing punishing sanctions and assassinating General Suleimani, arguably the second most powerful man in the country after the supreme leader – which have tightened the grip of hardliners and strengthened the belief that cultivating its nuclear programme and its proxies is a better bet than counting on meetings with western diplomats. A vital opportunity has been squandered, and Iranians are paying the price. Others may do so too.

To Tibetans they were objects used to celebrate life.Imma Ramos, the curator of the museum’s forthcoming exhibition on Tantra, hopes that by displaying such sensitive objects it will demystify them.The objects shine light on how, in Tantric Buddhist practice, life is conceived as a preparation for death. “There is nothing nihilistic about that,” said Ramos. “It is very much celebrating life. It is a much more positive, holistic attitude to death which is very different to the west where there is a very negative mindset around mortality.”The museum has held a number of consultations and workshops with Tibetans to prepare for the display and the exhibition will include audio interviews.Thupten Kelsang, an Oxford student who has helped gather people for the workshops and consultations, welcomed the display. “These are esoteric objects, very specialised objects and can sometimes be taken out of context.“I’m happy that with this exhibition Tibetans are finally coming forward and talking and sharing their opinions and life histories and experiences.”The five objects from the museum’s collection, all going on public display for the first time include a two-headed drum (damaru) and a thigh trumpet (kangling) used in the practice of Chöd (cutting off), which was developed and popularised by an 11th-century female tantric practitioner Machig Labdrön. The instruments are used to invoke ine spirits to feast on your own body, which is a way of surrendering your ego.A 19th-century skull cup (kapala) is going on display with its ornate metal base and cover. It would have been an important ritual object probably used in a communal Tantric practice performed by a group of lamas over several days.Tibetan Tantric practitioners often willingly donated their skulls and bones to a lama and monasteries in order to gain spiritual merit after their death.The bone apron (rus gyan) is an example of one worn by Tibetan monks and lamas during public festival and could have been used in dances with the purpose of generating merit to people watching and expel negative obstacles.It was acquired by John Claude White, a civil servant in colonial India who was part of the British military invasion of Tibet in 1903-04.He is likely to have seen the ritual as “devil-dancing”, language which is still often used by museums today, said Ayesha Fuentes, who is studying towards a PhD at Soas on the use of human remains in Tibetan Buddhist practice.She hopes the Tantric exhibition will help change the way museums describe Tibetan human remains. “That language of devil worship and necromancy and sorcery …it originated from colonial scholarship and was disseminated all through the anglophone world. In the States, where I’m from, museum records everywhere will still bring up that language,” she said.The subject of human remains in museum collections is often a charged one and continues to result in numerous repatriation cases. Arts Council England recently advertised for an expert to update its guidance on repatriation and restitution.Museums have also been accused of being overly sensitive about displaying human remains, fearing a backlash that may not exist.The British Museum has more than 6,000 examples of human remain, including Egyptian mummies and Lindow Man, who dates from the mid-first century and is considered the best preserved ancient body ever discovered in Britain.The Tibetan human remains will be part of an exhibition exploring and exploding myths about Tantra, usually equated in the west with sex and yoga.It is the UK’s first major exhibition about beliefs and rituals that began in sixth-century India. A major part of the show will be the importance of ine feminine power and challenging the perception of womanhood as passive and docile.• Tantra: Enlightenment to Revolution will be at the British Museum, London, 23 April-26 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5a62744ab9e530e56cc222c72f11d9c350ed902/95_306_1915_1149/master/1915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d0521ad2f7783c92c35be65bcff33d","title":"it is a little puzzling readers on early signs of spring","story":"We asked you to tell us about the early signs of spring near you.

It’s actually becoming more common to watch the fruit trees blossoming earlier. The above photo was taken on 5 February this year, a very warm day of about 20C, and shows an almond tree in bloom – something that usually happens in early March. The below photo was taken in February 2013 at the same location but showing the surroundings on a snowy day. Isabel Garcia, 35, PortugalMy partner and I are passionate hill walkers, hikers and in general outdoorsy people, so there’s plenty of room to compare. It’s been an incredibly warm winter this year and we’ve barely noticed the snowcaps on the hills in Lomond and Trossachs national park. Last year we were not able to take the road over the hills from Aberfoyle due to ice and snow today it was completely clear and not a sign of snow. We found these flowers during a walk in February this year around Loch Katrine, near the southern slopes of Primrose Hill. It’s a stark contrast compared to last winter here in Scotland when we went over snow of 10-15 centimetres for many kilometres – bloom was completely out of question. Martynas Virzintas, 39, hospitality manager, from Glasgow Spring is starting to burst out all over. The snowdrops have appeared and opened fully within a few days which is a little puzzling as they seem to have done so more rapidly than usual. Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey – but not this year. David Seedhouse, author, Wolverly, West MidlandsI am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. Leanne Werner, Labour councillor in Southwark, LondonMount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn’t happen until April.

She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating.”Ernman, a celebrated Swedish opera singer, and her husband Svante Thunberg, an actor, struggled to deal with their daughter’s silence and refusal to eat anything except tiny amounts of rice, avocado and gnocchi.She lost 10kg in two months and was on the verge of being admitted to hospital before turning a corner. Yet when Thunberg returned to school, her father realised she was being bullied. “The school isn’t sympathetic,” Ernman writes. “Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks.”After recovering some weight, Thunberg was assessed by psychiatrists and diagnosed with “high-functioning” autism, which Ernman describes as Asperger’s, as well as obsessive compulsive disorder.She went on to become attuned to the climate crisis, with the pivotal moment coming during a film shown in class about rubbish in the oceans, “an island of plastic” in the south Pacific. But after the lesson, while Thunberg was gripped with concern, other pupils enthused about a teacher’s trip to New York and flights to Thailand and Vietnam.“Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen,” her mother writes. “She saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO2 emissions with her naked eye.”In the summer of 2018, Thunberg began her first school strike, taking a homemade placard to stand outside the Swedish prime minister’s office.When she was joined by other activists, her father tried to persuade her to go home, aware of the emotional toll it was taking on her. But she refused and the time with other people had an unexpected effect on her.On the third day, a Greenpeace activist offered Greta some vegan Thai noodles. “She takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? … Greta keeps eating. Not just a few bites but almost the whole serving.”Thunberg is expected to come to the UK this week to take part in a youth protest in Bristol.Her presence at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate on Friday has been welcomed with delight by the organisers. “We are all just so excited – everyone is so excited about the thought of hearing her talk,” said Milly Sibson, who, like Thunberg, is 17. “I would love the chance to meet her because she is the founder of this movement and she is so important to it – she is an idol even though she is younger than me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622019f32c3fa578c5572032e35224831bb79a83/680_1336_2797_1678/master/2797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d9552698ed2cd3716f5ea1a2a9bf09e","title":"raf simons joins prada as co creative director","story":"Belgian designer will work alongside Miuccia Prada, with first joint collection due in SeptemberPrada has always been a brand that dictates the rest of fashion. That tradition was stepped up in Milan on Sunday with a groundbreaking announcement at the brand’s headquarters. Designer Raf Simons is to work alongside Miuccia Prada. The two will be co-creative directors.They are two of the most influential designers in fashion, which makes this an unprecedented alpha alliance – the fashion equivalent of Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp teaming up to manage Barcelona, or Bruce Springsteen and Madonna forming a supergroup. As CEO Patrizio Bertelli said through an interpreter in his introduction to the duo: “Here, again, the Prada Group have proven to be at the forefront of change.”“We like each other, we respect each other, we will see where that takes us,” said Prada. Simons will live between Antwerp, where his eponymous label is based, and Milan, to work on Prada. The first official Prada-Simons collection will be shown in September.Prada is now 70 and in her 42nd year designing for the company founded by her grandfather in 1913. She was clear, however, this was not a first move towards her retirement, with Simons in position to eventually take over. “Absolutely not,” she said. “I like working and this way I will work a bit more … I anticipate more discussion, more ideas.”Simons and Prada have known each other since around 2005, when Simons was appointed the creative director of Jil Sander, then owned by the Prada Group. They have remained friends since, and hinted that similar alliances have come close in the past. During a conversation between the two designers published by System magazine in 2016, Prada said: “One thing I would really love to do is to work with Raf, and maybe with other people – it would be so much fun.”The duo share an ability to draw on culture, politics and art to make fashion that is thoughtful without being too serious. Designing pretty clothes for the sake of pretty clothes is not something either of these designers are interested in. If Prada’s Instagram bio reads “thinking fashion since 1913”, Simons has said “I don’t want to show clothes, I want to show my attitude, my past, present and future.”Although they broadly agree on a point of view, they come from different places – a factor that makes a co-designed collection an intriguing idea. Belgian-born Simons, 52, began his career as a furniture designer and is regularly inspired by club and street culture, with menswear a strong suit. Since founding his own label in 1995, he has shown himself to be versatile, having worked as creative director at Jil Sander, Christian Dior and Calvin Klein. Prada, meanwhile, was born in Milan, studied for a PhD in political science in the 70s, and was active in the Italian communist party and women’s rights groups. She has since made her feminism – and the lives of women – a key theme in the way she designs.Simons joins the firm at an interesting time. Recently, there have been a few more struggles, both financially and politically. Prada was embroiled in a race row in 2018, thanks to figurines that resembled blackface in their New York store. It was announced earlier this month it had reach a settlement with NYC Commission on Human Rights, agreeing to give all staff in the city ersity training, and the appointment of a ersity and inclusion officer to vet all designs. This announcement is perhaps the mark of a new era, an alliance for perpetuity. “The contract is forever,” said Prada."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0f78acc5c8b416870cf7163109927b2f4d1fb50/0_0_4171_2400/master/4171.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1e82862867a3bc950ec733ad7b3d65da 1320w","title":"bruno fernandes vows to get united into champions league","story":"Bruno Fernandes vowed to help Manchester United “conquer” the race for a Champions League place following his impressive display in Sunday’s 3-0 victory over Watford at Old Trafford.The midfielder scored his first goal for the club – a 42nd-minute penalty – and also created second-half strikes for Anthony Martial, whose finish particularly impressed, and Mason Greenwood as United moved to within three points of Chelsea in fourth.“This is what I want to do and what I need to do,” said Fernandes, who signed for an initial £46m last month from Sporting. “Everyone knows we want to get into the Champions League places. I am here to help the team conquer this and keep winning games.Fernandes’s spot-kick featured him jumping in the air before he stroked it home. “It’s the way I shoot a penalty, it’s where I feel confident,” said the 25-year-old. “I do not shoot only that way but it felt the best way today.”Ole Gunnar Solskjær was asked if Fernandes’s fee looks a bargain. “In today’s market I think we got a good deal,” the manager said. “He has come in and done really well and given everyone a boost. It means more than just getting a player in: the fans are used to players with that personality, mentality and quality.“He has come in from day one and felt like a presence in the group from the first minute, demanding the ball. Some players take some time in warming up but he felt confident right away. It is a bit of a mix between Scholes and Veron, the temperament of Veron and a lot of the quality of Scholes.“He is one of the pieces we are trying to put together. He is a big piece and an important one as we get to the business end of the field. He is a box-to-box midfielder. He can do everything a midfielder can do.

A recent conversation over drinks with Mike Dean convinced the veteran of more than 600 games to realise that referees are human just like the rest of us, rather than unthinking, emotionless, card-brandishing cybernetic androids who simply materialise, fully formed like some sort of buzz-killing fun-assassins dispatched Terminator-style from the future.A man who does not so much polarise opinion among football fans of various teams as pull off the impressive feat of completely uniting it, Dean once found himself the subject of an unsuccessful petition signed by more than 100,000 Arsenal fans calling for him to be forbidden from refereeing any more of their team’s games. Renowned for his showmanship, occasional pomposity and apparent desire to be the centre of attention in any match he is tasked with officiating, he has for some time now been the best known and most unpopular of England’s top-flight refs.It wasn’t ever thus, however. As an overweight, teenage couch potato on the Wirral in the mid-80s, Dean decided to take up the whistle, cards and notebook in an effort to shed some excess weight. Working his way through the ranks while holding down a full-time job as a mass-executioner of chickens in a processing plant, he swapped fowls for fouls on a full-time basis after 16 years. He has since gone on to become one of the most disrespected match officials in the country, the prevailing opinion of football fans being that he is truly terrible at his very difficult job. He isn’t, of course, but that’s beside the point. Despite the occasional high-profile rick, the very nature of refereeing suggests you don’t become as well known and reviled as Dean has over the years without doing plenty right.“I’m sort of seeing the person behind the ref, y’know,” said Crouch to his co-presenters following Dean’s guest appearance on the most recent episode of the BBC’s That Peter Crouch Podcast. “I never really thought about what he did. In 1985 he started his referee’s journey when I was four years old and he’s still reffing at the highest level now, at 51. You have to give him some kudos for that. I never thought of the journey, or how he’d got there and I’m a little bit ashamed of that, honestly.”Given the infrequency of public utterances from match officials, getting Dean to appear on his podcast was quite the coup for Crouch and his backroom team even if one could be forgiven for suspecting their guest didn’t take much persuading. Premier League referees are currently forbidden from speaking to the media immediately after games, on the grounds that their boss, Mike Riley, head of the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, believes they could be too emotionally involved in “what they’ve just been through” and might say something ill-advised.In a world where Dean’s colleague Jon Moss recently came under fire for mildly mocking Bournemouth’s Dan Gosling, it is difficult to imagine the more garrulous Dean being reluctant to pass up the opportunity to grab the microphone firmly with both hands to explain himself in the wake of a contentious match. He certainly wasn’t backwards in coming forwards with his opinions on That Peter Crouch Podcast, although the convivial, laid-back tone of the show meant he was unlikely to be subjected to a particularly tough grilling.Having originated as a vehicle for its likeable star to provide his unique and amusing insights into life as a professional footballer, the show’s decision to provide a working referee with the opportunity to lift the lid on his day-to-day life proved something of a masterstroke. Invited to demonstrate he is not the show-stealer bloated with self-regard many perceive him to be, Dean did not exactly go out of his way to disabuse listeners of any such notions.“There’s a touch of arrogance about me when I walk out on the pitch I know there is,” he said. “But it’s also a lot of confidence in myself because I believe in my own ability.” Moments previously, having explained that the passing of time means he is no longer able to run as far or as fast as he used to, Dean had explained “without being big-headed” that he can “make decisions from 30 yards away and the players turn around and because it’s me I’ll get away with it”.Despite his high opinion of himself, Dean did come across as being extremely likeable, good naturedly detailing – among other vicissitudes of the job – the tedium of constantly being “booked” by beermat-brandishing pub-goers when trying to enjoy a night out with the wife. As Tranmere’s most famous fan, he made headlines last May when footage emerged of him ostentatiously cheerleading in the away end at Forest Green after his side secured their place in the League Two play-off final. For all his grumbling about lack of originality, one suspects he will be even more forlorn when the beermat-waving stops.In recent years it has become fairly customary for many live-match broadcasters to have a former whistle blower on hand to explain contentious decisions, albeit cloistered alone in what looks like a cupboard all the better to emphasise their pariah status. Fitness permitting, Dean hopes to put next season behind him before retiring but revealed his dread at the prospect of no longer being able to do his job. “God knows what I’ll do when I can’t referee again,” he told Crouch and his cohorts, although – like the man on whose podcast he guested – it’s difficult to imagine a man of his high profile remaining sidelined for very long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7be2e79ee86ae2ffe866327f4fb635aeb0205e/338_454_5278_3167/master/5278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b19c9154b08e02eb0b06566986151afa","title":"tell us have you moved across europe for love","story":"If you have moved across Europe to pursue romance we would like to hear from you.

And give it time – make it part of your lifeYoga, pilates, tai chi and stretching are all recommended for improving flexibility by the NHS. While pilates and yoga concentrate on building strength and flexibility, yoga is generally regarded as having a deeper focus on increasing the range of joint motion. “Within the physical movements, there are lots of opportunities to elongate the muscles,” says Chris Magee, head of yoga at Psycle London. Tai chi loosens muscles and stretches the whole body. It is especially useful for people with limited mobility, recovering from injury or balance problems as it can be adapted to suit a range of abilities.There are no direct links between diet and improved flexibility, says Claire Fudge, clinical dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, but including good-quality protein post-exercise, as part of a balanced diet, is a good move. When collagen, which is made from the building blocks of protein, is combined with vitamin C, it may help to decrease joint pain, supporting tendons and aiding recovery, says Fudge. “While it won’t be a wonder cure for making someone more flexible, it may help reduce muscle soreness after exercise.”Stretching is crucial, but not doing it for long enough is a common mistake, says Dr Tony Kay, professor of biomechanics at the University of Northampton. “Most people only hold a stretch for five to 10 seconds, but if you want to affect the stiffness of the tissues, it needs to be for quite a bit longer.” Dr Polly McGuigan, senior lecturer in biomechanics at the University of Bath, agrees, explaining that there are differing opinions on the duration of a static stretch, but she recommends around 30 seconds.“Flexibility is not something you can change quickly,” says Macguigan. “It takes time and a concerted effort with a static stretching programme.” How flexible you need to be depends on your lifestyle. Generally, for day-to-day activities, repeated essential tasks, such as bending down to put on socks, is enough. In a sporting environment, it depends on the type of exercise, says Kay. Tennis, squash, running, gymnastics and martial arts are among the sports in which an increased range of motion helps to reduce the risk of injury.While a warm bath or shower may have more of a psychological benefit, Macguigan believes it is worth a try. “One of the things that you have to overcome in stretching and increasing flexibility is the muscle’s natural protective response. So if you can relax the muscles via a warm shower or bath, you could potentially get more out of your stretches because you are starting with nice, warm, relaxed muscles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/871cb929e63f124dcba3827d42f2232089a8550a/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45d0aed85966d0057540b03f2a15a3fa","title":"how to clean your makeup brushes","story":"Synthetic or natural, they will last longer if you wash and dry them carefully once a week – without using hot waterAs a professional, I clean my brushes after every use, but if you are using your own brushes for your own makeup, once a week would be good. When I’m on a shoot, or out and about, I use a professional brush cleaner such as Parian Spirit, which is made from citrus and is environmentally friendly. It is also good if you are a bit lazy and don’t want to shampoo your brushes. Spray some on to a tissue, and wipe the brush until there is no product coming out of it.To wash, use lukewarm water – if the water is too hot, it will destroy the glue and loosen the hairs – and shampoo or a good washing-up liquid. Point the brush with the hairs facing downwards, so the water doesn’t run up into the brush. Lather up some shampoo and wash the bristles. When you rinse, squeeze until the water stops bubbling. Dry gently with a towel and dry them flat overnight.You can treat synthetic and natural brushes in the same way, as well as makeup sponges and powder puffs. With lip or foundation brushes, which can get covered in greasy makeup, get some oil – olive or baby oil is fine – and work a little bit through the dry brush.

Describing the Australian as a “force of nature”, he said he was not being allowed to exercise in the gym with other inmates.“We have to stop this extradition in the interests of 300 years of modernity, 300 years of trying to establish human rights and civil liberties in the west and around the world,” Varoufakis added.Christophe Deloire, secretary general of Reporters Without Borders, said journalism “will be in danger” at the Woolwich crown court hearing.He said: “If Assange would be extradited to the US, it would be the sign that journalism is considered espionage and it would endanger all journalists who want to uncover the lies of governments whatever the country.”Assange, 48, is wanted in the US on 18 charges over the publication of US cables a decade ago, and if found guilty could face a 175-year prison sentence.He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents.Last week Shipton warned his son’s extradition would be akin to a “death sentence”. He addressed the hundreds of Assange supporters after they marched through central London to Parliament Square on Saturday to protest against his son’s potential extradition.On Sunday evening, Assange supporters were setting up tents outside the court building.Musician Roger Waters, Varoufakis and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood also gave speeches in support of Assange."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df838d78e762dddd0616557559ca65fd75544bf/0_0_2896_1897/master/2896.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6fa4abac665031cda55557098fe2b0f2 960w","title":"macron not sure eu uk trade deal possible","story":"French president says fishing rights will be key point of contention for negotiations French president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday said he was “not sure” it would be possible for the European Union and Britain to reach a trade deal by the end of the year.Britain and the EU are about to embark on negotiations aiming to hammer out a trade agreement by the time the post-Brexit transition period shuts at the end of December.But France has made clear it thinks the negotiations will be particularly difficult, especially in such a tight timeframe.“I am not sure that an agreement will be reached between now and the end of the year,” Macron said at a meeting with fishermen, who are concerned for their livelihoods after Brexit, at an agricultural trade event in Paris.“Anyway, it is going to become more tense because (the British) are very hard,” he said, adding that fishing rights would be a key point of contention.Britain formally ended its 47-year membership of the EU on January 31, nearly four years after a majority voted to leave the bloc in a 2016 referendum.France and several other countries want to be able to keep fishing in British waters, while London wants full autonomy and limited access for European fishermen.After 47 years and 30 days it is all over.

In Swindon – stay with me! – a man called Aameen Patel is working the graveyard shift at Highways England’s traffic HQ when his computer screen goes blank, and the room is plunged into darkness. He tries to report these things to his superiors, but can get no signal on his mobile. What’s going on? Looking at the motorway from the viewing window by his desk, he observes, not an orderly stream of traffic, but a dramatic pile-up of crashed cars and lorries – at which point he realises something is seriously amiss. In the Britain of 2037, everything, or almost everything, is controlled by 7G wireless technology, from the national grid to the traffic (not only are cars driverless a vehicle cannot even join a motorway without logging into an “on-route guidance system”). There is, then, only one possible explanation: the entire 7G network must have gone down.It sounds like I’m describing a novel – and it’s true that Aameen Patel will soon be joined by another fictional creation in the form of Bill Donoghue, who works at the Bank of England, and whose job it will be to tell the prime minister that the country is about to pay a heavy price for its cashless economy, given that even essential purchases will not be possible until the network is back up (Bill’s mother-in-law is also one of thousands of vulnerable people whose carers will soon be unable to get to them, the batteries in their electric cars having gone flat). But Apocalypse How? is not a novel. It’s a peculiar hybrid: part fable, part fact. Aameen, Bill and all Letwin’s other characters exist only to illustrate aspects of his wider thesis, which is that our increasing reliance on integrated digital technology may be leading us, and ultimately every country in the world, in the direction of a catastrophe. I exaggerate a little, but think TV’s Survivors minus the mystery virus (though at the moment, we handily have one of those on our hands, too).Letwin, an old fashioned keep-calm-and-carry-on kind of Tory (though he left parliament at the 2019 general election), doesn’t look or sound like a doom-merchant. Even last year, as he led the bloody parliamentary fight to ensure that Britain did not leave the EU without a deal, he was always smiling: a cherubic figure whose springy hair – it rises benignly from his head like ice-cream from a cone – only made him seem all the more graciously donnish. But a doom-merchant he is, or so it would seem. All he needs now is a sign that reads: “The end is nigh”.The thoughts of rack and ruin started when he was still a member of the cabinet (his last big job was chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster under David Cameron). “In government, I’d be dealing with all sorts of risks,” he says. “Each day, I put aside a small bit of time in which to think, and on one of these occasions, I forced myself to consider how likely it was that any future administration would be able to protect us from certain risks to a degree that we could be fairly confident the situation in question wouldn’t arise. The more I thought about it, the more it became clear there wasn’t any serious likelihood of that at all. This lodged itself in my mind, and it worried me for months and months.” Apocalypse How? is the 220-page result of all this worry. In its pages, a space-weather event having taken its effect on satellites, Britain falls into chaos for five days, when, to a degree, law and order breaks down and 100,000 vulnerable people die (frail, cold and hungry, neither the emergency services nor the army can reach them, there being no functioning communications system, and no paper record of their whereabouts).Letwin and I meet in Mayfair, at the Legatum Institute, a right-leaning thinktank where he is now a fellow. It’s a luxurious place, halfway between a gentleman’s club and a Harley Street clinic. Sitting in reception, magazines fanned out on a coffee table, I almost expect him to appear before me in a white coat, a stethoscope dangling at his neck. But of course it’s me who’ll be asking the questions, nodding sympathetically as he lets it all out. Does he like to talk? He does. Letwin is, I think, used to being listened to, a privilege afforded him ever since he was a small child (we’ll come back to this). His answers are charming, but prolix. His way of dodging a bullet is to fill the air with words, and never mind if they refer to another matter entirely.Before we get on to the internet, and its terrifying powers, I must ask: what’s it like on the outside? Is he in mourning for life as an MP – he entered parliament in 1997, as the member for West Dorset – or does he feel like dancing across Berkeley Square? He grins. “If you want to have a glimpse of what entering the garden of Eden is like, what you need to do, in my experience, is be an MP for a quarter of a century and then stop. This is just… totally wonderful. I can’t describe how marvellous it is. I very much enjoyed my time in parliament, though I can’t say I enjoyed the last year. But the first morning of waking up, and not having several hundred emails to deal with… I hadn’t realised how wonderful the commodity of time is.” He laughs, a high-pitched giggle that makes me think of a baby that has just seen itself in a mirror for the first time.And how does he feel about the country, post-election and post-Brexit? (He was for Remain in the referendum, but he also voted for all Theresa May’s deals and for the one Boris Johnson got through the Commons.) Has it, in some profound way, changed? “That’s a big question,” he says. “Lots of things happen simultaneously in countries they’re very complicated. But I do think there is a national consensus that we’ve done what we’ve done, and we must now try and get on and be sensible.” He hopes negotiations with the EU will take place in a more “sane and rational” environment – though this isn’t to say that he thinks our trading relationship will be easy to sort out. “It could go well, or it could go… less badly,” he says, uncertainly.But we must talk about the book I’m holding in my hands: Apocalypse How? It all began, he thinks, with his wellington boots, which he had to pull on with alarming regularity while in government. “I don’t know if you remember the terrible floods that besieged the Lake District during the coalition government? Well, when we finally got through those, I sat down with senior experts in the field, and I asked them: why are these events that are supposed to happen every year in 100 happening each year? And in that moment, I could see it in their eyes. How, they thought, can this minister be so ignorant?” He laughs.“Very patiently, they began to explain to me what should have been blindingly obvious. If you have 1,000 places that have a one in 1,000 chance of flooding, it’s pretty likely one will flood every year – and even more so if they have a one in 100 chance of flooding. The statistics don’t mean what the layman thinks. If we’re going to avoid flooding, we must assume it is going to happen.”Surely someone, somewhere, is on top of this? Apparently not. According to Letwin, politicians are unwilling to do things for which they won’t be thanked (if the public was successfully protected from digital meltdown, no one would ever know, and thus their efforts would go unacknowledged). They operate on a short-term basis, and they procrastinate. Cost-benefit analysis combined with the difficulty of estimating probabilities is likely to suggest to them that investing in this area simply isn’t worth it. Like all of us, they also tend, for complex psychological reasons, to underprepare for disaster. Needless to say, I’m transfixed by his honesty in this matter – as if he had not been a career politician himself! The irony, however, seems to elude him.Of course, as he also notes in his book, policymakers could bring in “free thinkers” to “think the unthinkable”. But this is tricky. Dominic Cummings’s dim view of special advisers, and his call for “weirdos and misfits” to apply for jobs at No 10, don’t quite wash with Letwin. “I understand why people get frustrated by bureaucracies. There are moments when you’re facing a very simple crisis, one so great you must just cut a swath through it. The second world war would be an example of that, when defeating the Nazis was the only thing that mattered, and Churchill got this in a way other people didn’t. But that’s only appropriate when the threat is immediate and existential. Most things are more like climate change than the Nazis they’re not simple, they’re not immediate, and you can’t act alone.”All this said, you have to wonder why heads are buried so deeply in the sand when it comes to our digital future. By his telling, the solution isn’t difficult. “What it amounts to is an analogue solution to a digital problem,” he says. “It wouldn’t be a perfect back-up, but it would get us through. We need to ensure that stuff we could do 50 years ago has been laid in store in such a way that we can get by.” He’s talking, I think, about old-fashioned things such as landlines, walkie-talkies and, perhaps, reserves of diesel and the kind of robust vehicles that require it.Naturally, I can’t help wondering if all this has affected his own life. Is his house awash with torches, tins and clockwork radios? Is he a secret survivalist? “Well, we have four or five torches. Which work.” He giggles. “And if I hear there is a problem about fuel coming along, I fill up. I have a map in the car, and a paper record of my contacts. These are sensible precautions.” Later, I make a joke about yoghurt pots tied together with string. But it falls flat, possibly because at his primary school, unlike mine, children were not taught how to make rudimentary communication devices from household debris.Letwin is not precisely what many people perhaps imagine him to be, for all that he is an Old Etonian with a voice to match. (“Oh, I see,” he says, when I point this out. “You thought I was a seventh earl or something.”) His grandparents were Ukrainian Jews who fled Europe for America. His parents, William and Shirley, were American academics who settled in Britain (his father was professor of political science at the London School of Economics his mother taught, in the 70s, at that hotbed of radical conservative thought, Peterhouse College, Cambridge). They were also famous hosts, whose salons – they lived in a house near Regent’s Park – were attended by the likes of Isaiah Berlin.From Eton, he went to Cambridge University, Princeton and then Cambridge again, after which he joined Margaret Thatcher’s Policy Unit – and thus began his somewhat gaffe-prone political career (among other things, in 2011 he was found to have thrown away confidential letters from constituents in a bin in St James’s Park – a breach of data protection for which he apologised). Is he, I wonder, surprised that our latest prime minister is an Etonian? Shouldn’t things have changed a bit (a lot) by now? “Well, yes,” he says, with a laugh. “I didn’t vote for him to be leader! The thing about Eton is that it is a privilege and a millstone. It creates an often mistaken impression of what you are, and that’s unfortunate. On the other hand, it gives you a fantastic education, and it encourages you to be confident, to take up positions, and not to be intimidated by authority. But it is a kind of shortcut, and an unfair privilege, there’s no doubt about that.”Predictably, we run out of time at the Legatum Institute. This part of our conversation takes place later, Letwin talking to me on his (yes) mobile phone as he walks to work – a situation that makes it all the easier for me to ask, rather crossly: are people like him on their way out? Will they ever be on their way out? As ever, though, he’s gracious, mild-mannered. “Yes, I think we are, and that is quite right. Society is dramatically more meritocratic and less old school tie than when I was growing up – though we’ve got some way to go.” Has he learned to check his privilege? He insists that he has. “I’m extremely conscious that in a thousand ways I’ve been fantastically lucky,” he says. “I bless my luck all the time – and I know that it is luck.” After we hang up, I picture him beetling along the London pavements, his trouser pockets fat with matches, peanuts and Kendal Mint Cake.

Boris Johnson will fail to ‘level up’ the economy if he refuses to abandon austerity and tackle these health inequalities.”Ashworth is also due to challenge Labour about being more ambitious on addressing child poverty. An analysis of the party’s 2019 manifesto by the Resolution Foundation concluded that a focus on spending for older voters meant Labour would not notably reduce levels of child poverty.“We know a child growing up in poverty is more likely to suffer ill health and in turn more likely to develop health problems in later life,” Ashworth will say. “Yet thanks to Tory cuts, child poverty is now projected to rise to the highest level since record began – higher child poverty than even the Thatcher years.“Every child matters and deserves the best possible start but instead this government condemns future generations to becoming ill quicker in life and dying sooner. Challenging these health inequalities and escalating child poverty must be a moral crusade for Labour.”The Marmot review, which was commissioned in 2008 by the then Labour government, uncovered massive “social gradient in health”, meaning that the lower a person’s socioeconomic position, the worse their health was likely to be.Calling the issue “a matter of fairness and social justice”, the report in 2010 concluded that premature deaths from health inequalities was losing an annual total of between 1.3m and 2.5m extra years of life. The economic costs of this, Marmot said, were “staggering”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa83b682f0f6b147ce61fec686f1f6a2914ff9af/0_25_4276_2567/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=161527d07bbb82d01f78236222682441","title":"bullish manu tuilagi leads charge for england with a lot left in the tank","story":"The centre’s barnstorming performance helps soften up Ireland as Eddie Jones’s ornery, outsize team give a glimpse of what they are capable of at their bestIt had been six months to the very day since England last played at Twickenham, in a World Cup warm-up against Ireland, and that was a handsome victory too, even prettier than this one. Since then, they’ve been halfway around the world and back again, one step away from the top of it, too, when they lost to South Africa in the final.They’ve clocked up a lot of miles, a fair few wins and those two telling defeats, the one in Yokohama and the other in Paris, since. And now they were back. In more ways than one, since they were playing something like the way they did last autumn when they won those two matches against Australia and New Zealand.Hell, but they’re an ugly, awkward team to play against when they’re in this mood, with the power to beat you on the inside, and the speed to beat you on the outside, and the wit to switch quickly between the two ways when they want to. For the first time this Six Nations, England’s fans got to see a little of what this ornery, outsize lot are capable of at their best. They softened Ireland up, and then sliced them apart. “Constant” was the word Owen Farrell used afterwards to describe the way his team had played in the first half. And he’s right, there’s a relentlessness to their style which means the opposition isn’t allowed as much as a spare second to gather their breath.And you could see that in the mistakes Ireland made, the split-second hesitations deep in their own territory that led to England’s first two tries. Johnny Sexton spent most of the opening quarter playing toreador to Manu Tuilagi, who kept just coming, running right at him, by him, over him. Sexton must be thoroughly sick of the sight of Tuilagi. He’s played against Ireland five times in his career now, and England have won every one of them. Here he was again, sucking in tacklers like some black hole, one, two, three at a time until finally they all came down in a tumble of limbs. Tuilagi, on the other hand, seldom needs any help making his hits and he flattened CJ Stander.It’s not just Tuilagi, of course. The minute you bring him down there’s Courtney Lawes following up after, and Kyle Sinckler, and Maro Itoje, George Kruis, Tom Curry and the rest of them, hard-chargers, and coming fast, the lot of them. It’s a thankless job for the opposition. In all the confusion when England switched it up and Ben Youngs whipped in a wicked little grubber kick through the Irish defence, Sexton flapped at the bouncing ball behind his own tryline and George Ford whipped round him to touch down the rebound. It was the first in a string of uncharacteristic mistakes by the Irish fly-half, usually such a cool hand. It felt like England had got to him.The second try was similar. It was Jacob Stockdale this time lingering for a moment as he watched Ford’s chip bounce in front of him, he left just enough time for Elliot Daly to squeeze past him and slap the ball down with one outstretched hand. It was another piece of scrambled thinking by the Irish. Daly, back at full-back, seemed happier there than he had been on the wing. Certainly it was his best game in a while. His score made it 14-0, and from there, whatever anyone said, you could tell there was no way back into it for the Irish. It was impressive, from a team who were under some pressure, too, after one loss and one narrow win in the opening fortnight.“There’s a lot left in us,” Farrell agreed. Ireland had much the better of the final 15 minutes, when England should have been pressing for the fourth try that would have won them a bonus point. So Jones’s substitutions did not have the sort of impact he would have liked. And the decision to bring on Charlie Ewels to pack down at No 8 once Lawes had gone off was an especially odd one.But then, it seems like Jones knows best. On paper it looks like his team are full of square pegs in round holes, with Joseph, a centre, playing on the wing, and Lawes, a second row, on the flank, and Curry, a flanker, at No 8.Well, they all worked well enough against Ireland. Joseph made one superb break down the wing, beating two men, and Curry followed it up with another. It still feels like he is out of his best position, it’s just that he is a good enough player to get away with it. And then there was Lawes, who has never seemed a natural fit in that position but was the man of the match for all his conspicuous carries, tackles and takes at the lineout.It may come too late to help them win this Six Nations, since France have the advantage after beating them on that first weekend, but there’s no doubt England are back running in the right direction again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c09e757e710da3d8ed2f8dd77c42fbb4b63184f/0_415_2278_1366/master/2278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecb87f81a28c5963490a81ca054a0a04","title":"england undone by south africa at womens t20 world cup","story":"In a setback to their hopes of reaching the T20 World Cup semi-finals, England suffered a dramatic final-over defeat in their opening match against South Africa at Perth on Sunday.With South Africa, chasing a 124-run target, needing seven runs from the final four balls, it came down to a battle of experience: England’s Katherine Brunt against South Africa’s Mignon du Preez, playing in her 100th T20 international. It was the latter who came out on top – walloping a 67-metre six straight over backward square leg, before pulling the next ball for four to take her side across the line with two balls to spare. It is only the third time that South Africa have ever got the better of England in the shortest format.“It’s nice to finally beat them in an ICC tournament,” Du Preez said. “This is the seventh one I’ve played in and we’ve never got close before. We’ve always known how strong we are and that within the team we have matchwinners but we had a monkey on our back.”“I’ve played enough games in my career to be able to step up in crucial moments and I think to finally do that and contribute to the team is really special.”The result means England are likely to need to win every one of their remaining group matches to reach the semi-finals.“It puts the pressure on,” Natalie Sciver said. “The quality of the teams overall for this T20 World Cup has stepped up a notch.”South Africa had been well on course at 90 for one in the 16th over, with Marizanne Kapp and Dane van Niekerk having racked up an 84-run partnership after their bombastic opener Lizelle Lee fell early in the chase but Sarah Glenn’s maiden World Cup wicket looked like it might have spoiled the party – Kapp sending a drifting ball straight back into the hands of the young leg-spinner, after amassing a 33-ball 38. Van Niekerk departed four balls later, four runs short of a half-century, caught by Tammy Beaumont at point attempting to cut Sophie Ecclestone. Ecclestone’s second wicket again looked like it might be decisive, removing Chloe Tryon with a quicker ball off the last ball of the 19th over that slid past her defences, after the power-hitter had racked up 12 quick runs. Du Preez, though, calmly finished the job.Despite the close nature of the result, England’s tactics of playing eight batsmen, with Tammy Beaumont dropping down to No 6 (both adopted under their new coach Lisa Keightley), are likely to come under the spotlight after this performance. Opener Amy Jones had looked in fine form early on, attacking the left-arm spin of Nonkululeko Mlaba with a couple of lofted drives all four of England’s boundaries in the powerplay came off her bat.She came unstuck, however, trying to repeat the feat against the considerably more experienced Kapp, instead sending it into the hands of Tryon at mid-off, dismissed for a 20-ball 23. Four balls later – having faced just four deliveries in the opening four overs – Wyatt over-egged the pudding in her keenness to get going, popping the first ball of Ayabonga Khaka’s spell up into the hands of Lee at point.From there, wickets continued to fall all too regularly, leg-spinner Van Niekerk making a decisive intervention with the ball at either end of her four-over spell. She first removed the in-form Heather Knight, courtesy of an excellent effort by Shabnim Ismail running round from long-on, and later the frustrated Fran Wilson, also caught in the deep after England mustered just one boundary between the eighth and 15th overs. Only a late-dash 41-ball half-century by Sciver dragged their effort up towards respectability.“We were a bit short with the bat – we didn’t get quite enough runs unfortunately,” Sciver said. “As a batting unit we are not quite aligned – there’s a few things we need to tweak.“Hopefully we can go out in the next game at Canberra and play positively and play with freedom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5d7ed510064ee2000ddf668dd1252f87b3ef000/0_72_3249_1949/master/3249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ee4269a11207cb74f6a8af167739ac","title":"patrick reed holds nerve to secure victory in mexico","story":"This rapidly developed into the World Golf Championship of the damned. For so much of Sunday, the devil could have cast his net over the leaders of the WGC-Mexico Championship. Three and four way ties as further players lay within touching distance pointed towards a gripping denouement.Ultimately it came down to Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Reed, two golfers seeking to switch unfortunate narratives as attached to them. DeChambeau, widely castigated for slow play and - in this very tournament - using his putter as a mallet on a green, ultimately threw away the chance of the biggest win of his career. Reed, who has been berated for his actions as drew a penalty in the Hero World Challenge in December, overhauled the Californian. When it counted, Reed let his golf do the talking yet again.Reed’s ability to ignore external noise - and, as coming from Brooks Koepka in recent days, there was rather a lot of it - really is quite something.He has been publicly questioned by his peers and responded brilliantly.This victory all-but secures Reed’s return to the Ryder Cup - alongside Koepka, one assumes - at Whistling Straits in September. Reed took a two-stroke lead onto the 18th tee after three birdies in a row, with his subsequent victory by one. Reed signed for a Sunday 67, meaning an 18 under par total.DeChambeau’s 65 was hardly moderate but with the trophy in his sights, he stumbled. This marks Reed’s second World Golf Championship which, coupled with the donning of a Green Jacket in 2018, triggers memories of the Texan once proclaiming himself a top five player in the world. Who’s laughing now? DeChambeau had separated himself from the field with birdies at the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th. Yet Reed refused to go away the former Masters champion collected shots at the 12th and 15th. Crucially, Reed hadn’t dropped a single shot all day as DeChambeau did precisely that with a three-putt at the 17th. Almost immediately, Reed hit an approach shot to tap-in range on 16, meaning he held a one-stroke lead with two to play.Reed’s birdie at the penultimate hole rendered his bogey on 18 irrelevant.To DeChambeau’s credit, he headed to the final green to congratulate the champion.“My team and I, we’ve worked so hard through the end of last year and also at the beginning of this year,” Reed said. “It kept on feeling like I was playing some good golf, just we weren’t quite able to get over that hump.” Rory McIlroy had been within one of the lead until DeChambeau pressed upon his accelerator and the world No1 three-putted the 12th. From there, McIlroy was playing for the top five. His 68 meant fifth place at 14 under.McIlroy will be disappointed at not being in position to pressurise DeChambeau over the closing stretch but, in truth, this was a decent tournament finish from the Northern Irishman after three days of playing with his B-game. “I’m looking forward to a week off,” McIlroy said. “It’s frustrating, I didn’t feel like I got the best out of myself.” Whilst McIlroy essentially held things together, Justin Thomas imploded. In what represented a curious scenario for a player who is typically formidable from the front, the 54-hole leader slipped to a 73. Thomas encountered problems from the tee all day, with a four over par run between the 7th tee and 10th green epitomising his struggles. Thomas tied sixth with Tyrrell Hatton, with the Englishman due immense credit for this performance in his first start of 2020. Hatton has been suffering from a wrist injury.Jon Rahm could have toppled McIlroy at the summit of the world rankings with a win and was amongst those tied at the top early on day four. Rahm’s 67 meant a 15 under par total, a tie for third with Erik Van Rooyen and that McIlroy’s position is safe for another week at least.As Reed was sealing victory, Viktor Hovland did likewise in Puerto Rico. A first PGA Tour success for the 22-year-old from Oslo - well known as an exceptional talent - will only fuel theories about Ryder Cup participation later this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c48cfac17c59ce3c7f95ced5008cbb331ba78009/0_316_3288_1972/master/3288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7d841dbc194106aa025b2bd9d17da0e","title":"bbc takes eurovision choice from public in bid to improve record","story":"Music label BMG’s choice for 2020 contest will be revealed on Thursday morningThe BBC has decided against allowing viewers to choose the UK’s entry to this year’s Eurovision song contest, following the poor performance of the British public’s recent choices.Instead, Eurovision presenter Graham Norton will unveil Britain’s representative on Thursday, with the singer and song having been selected by record label BMG without public consultation. The unveiling of the entry will take place on Greg James’ Radio 1 Breakfast Show and Ken Bruce’s Radio 2 morning programme on Thursday morning.Norton confirmed the details while announcing details of the BBC’s coverage in the contest, which will be held in Rotterdam in May. He optimistically asked: “Will we finally hear those elusive words, ‘United Kingdom, douze points?’”Britain’s last four Eurovision entries were chosen by the public, and three of them finished in either last or second last place. The most recent contestant, 19-year-old Michael Rice, won just 11 points in last year’s Tel Aviv contest, finishing 26th.In a bid to avoid another embarrassing national defeat, the process has been handed to one of the world’s biggest record labels – who have publish hits by the likes of Lewis Capaldi, George Ezra and Jess Glynne – in the hope that they can find a way to make Europeans vote for the UK.BMG was asked to find a “song with broad international appeal” and secure a singer “who embodies the spirit and values of the Eurovision Song Contest”, although it is unclear whether they have chosen a new or an established act.However, there is no guarantee that taking back control from the public and giving the choice to experts will lead to British success on the continent. The last time the BBC unilaterally chose artists for Eurovision through an internal selection process, the results varied wildly, with only Blue’s relatively successful 2011 entry bucking a long-trend of underperformance.Some countries have a highly competitive national singing competition to choose their Eurovision entry, with the likes of Sweden saying the process has contributed to their success in the competition. Many recent Eurovision winners have also benefited from already being stars across Europe before the contest begins, meaning audiences are already aware of them when voting begins on the night. Some other countries have poured substantial sums into the contest, viewing winning as a point of national pride.While almost every other participating country has to take part in a semi-final before qualifying for the final, the UK has a historic automatic pass to the final due to the amount of money the BBC puts into Eurovision. However, there have long been complaints that inidual countries’ votes often reflect political allegiances rather than musical qualities, and the UK’s departure from the European Union at the end of January is unlikely to have endeared the nation to many continental viewers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa5e65fa4b824a3ea8064f8f39a03c4b4f94ef5/0_159_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f062802c7fc9b0d028c572de3989ce7","title":"doctor who recap series 38 episode nine ascension of the cybermen","story":"From spaceships to Cybermen, there’s plenty of fun to be had as the finale begins. But be warned – change is coming and there may well be some casualtiesSpaceships! I had a pang of excitement at the first of this two-part finale. It had only just struck me that every adventure so far this year has been Earthbound (Orphan 55 turned out to be Earth too, remember). And while that has been mainly fine, it’s a fizzing, refreshing rush to witness an epic space opera on the grandest scale. With loads of spaceships. And, of course, Cybermen, but more on that below.It now feels almost comical that we spent Chris Chibnall’s first year in charge grumbling about his Who being too simplistic. With one episode to go, it seems almost impossible that all the strands can be tied up. Which, more than likely, is the point. We are in a long game.Following the chilling events of Villa Diodati, the Doctor attempts to limit the damage of her own haste by following Shelley’s instructions to track down the Lone Cyberman to an indeterminate planet in an indeterminate period of the far future, and the grim aftermath of the much-storied Great Cyberwars. They encounter the last seven “scraps” of humanity – desperate refugees who never trained for war but have adapted just the same. Chibnall’s “woke” gene is still in action – these people were teachers and nurses. And the desperation of the survivors is horribly palpable.Team Tardis arrive tooled up with a rescue plan and a multitude of Cyberbusting technology – all of which gets destroyed within minutes, causing the Doctor to lose it for putting her friends in more danger than she ever has before. All the while there is a series of flashbacks to period Ireland, portraying the life of an abandoned baby named Brendan who meets a grisly fate on his retirement from a heroic police career at the hands of some spooks – the hint being that this was the Lone Cyberman.From there on, it is, for the most part, a fun, classic Doctor Who, with doomed spaceships and advancing Cybermen abounding. Until things get somewhat psychedelic once again with the discovery of a kindly old wizard man named Ko Shamur, who guards an escape portal to what transpires to be … Gallifrey, the Doctor’s destroyed home planet! Before we can catch our breath, out pops Hot Camp Master, cackling: “Be afraid, Doctor, because everything is about to change.” A change is coming, but I for one need a lie down.After nearly two series of moaning about being hungry, Graham is getting good at this stuff. Even Yaz notices, commenting on how far he has come, occupying her typical space between genuinely nice girl and overachieving Doctor’s pet. “We’re not lucky, sunshine, we’re persistent,” insists Graham to the survivors. “We never give up.” The pluck is tangible next to the fatalism that surrounds them.In fact, all of Team Tardis are at the top of their game right now – even Ryan seems momentarily over his wobble about the space-time lifestyle. Which is perhaps why the Doctor so recklessly endangers them in the first place. It is in the nature of a constantly regenerating show that a woman largely known for putting friends at risk and “turning people into weapons” that this is presented as a new idea, but I suppose the nature of mistakes is that you tend to keep making the same ones. And Jodie Whittaker runs with material worthy of her performance. In any case, we all know what they say about pride coming before a fall. Walsh, Gill or Cole have yet to be confirmed for series 13, and I’m not feeling optimistic about all of them making it out alive. Or as humans.The newly pimped-up Cybermen are a rowdier bunch than we have seen before. Gone are the slow, raspy advances, in favour of a fast-moving, laser-happy battle force. I am not entirely sure which version I prefer, but they are more badass than we have seen them since the series returned. They feel like a genuine threat, and the presence of some classic models affords us some minor finale fan service. Their reason for appearing, of course, is to amplify the horror of the Lone ranger – “the Cyberman that makes other Cybermen scream”, as Rovia puts it.This is where Chibnall’s take on the number two monster comes alive. This guy was never “finished”, from his face to his emotional suppression. He suffers from the human weakness of pride, which makes him all the more dangerous. And when the Doctor chides him about “hating his own existence”, his anger and hatred being human emotions, it barely touches a (modified) nerve. Also, the flying Cyberdrone heads are cool.Where to begin? What went on in the Cyberwars to leave everything so devastated? Is Hot Camp Master truly in league with the Cybermen again? And, if so, how did he survive Missy’s final predicament? In what sense is “everything” about to change? Because we had almost forgotten about her with everything else going on, will we be meeting Doctor Ruth again? (There’s no sign of her in the trailer for next week’s episode.) Why is Gallifrey at the end of the portal on Ko Shamur’s beach? Is that where the humans have all been escaping to? Who is Brendan? Presumably the Lone Cyberman following his unfortunate fate. But is he also the Timeless Child? Will Ryan and Yaz ever get it on? We should discover at least some of that in the finale, The Timeless Children. Good luck with all that, Captain Chibnall.It’s big finale time, in the feature-length special The Timeless Children. The title at least suggests we may get some answers, while the synopsis warns: “This is going to hurt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86f82d9e29a44748047fc6061946b71155094e7e/585_1313_2601_1561/master/2601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f39a980cda400555ada34ccdcb90845","title":"sharon horgan i want adventures to do stuff that is challenging","story":"Sharon Horgan’s eviscerating self-awareness underlies some of the biggest cult comedy hits of recent years. But now she’s going after mainstream movies and a directorial debutSharon Horgan doesn’t especially enjoy watching herself on screen any more. She feels an awkwardness that, she thinks, comes from years of sitting in edit suites scrutinising take after take of television programmes she has created, co-written and starred in. Shows such as Pulling, a black comedy about three female flatmates that first aired in 2006 and was her breakthrough. And Catastrophe, the Channel 4 series (rejected by the BBC) that she made with Rob Delaney about a one-night stand with long-term effects that ran for four seasons and has been broadcast in 133 countries and now means she has to have clocks in her London offices showing the time in New York and Los Angeles. But Horgan, who is 49 and has eviscerating self-awareness, also accepts that “vanity” might be a factor.“I just don’t love seeing myself as an older person on screen,” she says, with a snorty half-laugh that seems to punctuate her most radically honest statements. “There’s always a weird transitional period where you go from being able to play a girl who doesn’t know where her life is going to playing the mother of an 18-year-old. The adjustment for that just takes a little bit of time.”Horgan is sitting in the boardroom of Merman, the production company she founded in 2014 with producer Clelia Mountford. It’s a large, grown-up room with a view of the London Eye and a clutch of awards dotted around, but casually. She’s wearing a black vest, wide-legged jeans and Adidas shelltoes, and looks unfussily chic. “I generally like to pick up my clothes from the floor from the night before and wear them for as long as possible,” she explains. “It’s fine when I’m at home, but if I come in here three days in a row and I’m wearing the same thing, people point it out.”We’re here to talk about Military Wives, which she stars in with Kristin Scott Thomas, and in which she plays, as it happens, the mother of an 18-year-old. It’s a dramatisation, by the Full Monty director Peter Cattaneo, of the true story of the women from a Royal Marines base in Devon who formed a choir while their partners were away in Afghanistan and wound up the Christmas No 1 in 2011.So, has Horgan seen it yet? “I didn’t watch it at the premiere,” she admits. “But my PR lady said, ‘You cannot go into interviews to talk about the film if you haven’t seen it.’ So I got them to send me a screener and I watched it on my laptop, which I’m sure Peter absolutely abhorred.”What did she think? “Kristin and I had the same experience when we read the initial script: it fucked both of us up,” Horgan says. “We knew that if they were the right songs, if they were done in the right way, that this female friendship – the female version of a bromance – could be a really moving and sweet and funny and life-affirming film. So, yeah, when I watched it, I thought: ‘It’s all those things I thought it would be.’”While Military Wives follows a familiar formula, you would have to have a black heart – something, admittedly, Horgan has been accused of – not to have to wipe away a small tear by the end. Horgan is the best thing about it, undercutting any hoariness with a curl of her lip or a withering aside. (She didn’t officially work on the script, but with Scott Thomas she did “inject a bit of us into it”.) Military Wives probably won’t do the full Full Monty in terms of impact, but there’s a calendar-girls, potato-peel-pie-society market for it. “Different films, but similar ingredients,” says Horgan. “It just makes people feel good.”Military Wives is a tonal departure for her “uplifting” and “feel-good” haven’t exactly been in her wheelhouse. Horgan has summed up her work as being “funny and grim”, but what makes her comedy rare is how much she makes you care about her characters, even when they are behaving abominably. The relationship between Rob and Sharon in Catastrophe feels real – screwed up but real. “You let me put my penis in your mouth, but you won’t let me put my T-shirts in your drawer?” Rob notes when they start living together. The interactions between the parents in her BBC2 comedy Motherland are excruciating variations of ones you see at the school gates, especially if you are a bit middle-class. Horgan has an unerring ear and an unsparing eye.“I watched the trailer for Military Wives with my 16-year-old daughter and she laughed all the way through it,” says Horgan. “And I was like, ‘Fucking cow.’ And she was like, ‘No, it’s great. It’s just funny seeing you with this beautiful song running throughout and then cutting to you on a keyboard and then cutting to you with your head in your hands. It’s just funny. You have to admit it’s funny.’”It is kind of funny, Horgan concedes. Military Wives is a step change to what she’s done before, but she has her reasons for branching out. Merman exists because Horgan was fed up with coming up with ideas, writing them, and then taking them to someone else to make them. The company started slowly, but in the past five years it has become an industry powerhouse. Its productions are ubiquitous on TV channels and streaming services, and it is known especially for developing new female talent. These include shows that Horgan co-writes, but doesn’t appear in, such as Motherland, and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker for HBO, but also Aisling Bea’s This Way Up, Frayed by Sarah Kendall and There She Goes, which won a Bafta for Jessica Hynes. Merman has also moved into drama and films: its first feature, Herself, by Irish writer and actor Clare Dunne, premiered last month at the Sundance Film Festival and was bought by Amazon.“I’ve spent so many years doing things that were always called cult comedies,” explains Horgan. “So it’s nice to do something that will have a bigger audience. And being cynical and business-minded, it helps your profile when I go into pitches here and in the US. If you’re going in with a writer who is maybe less well known, who you’re wanting people to take a chance on, people give a shit about that.”Horgan sounds conflicted. She notes that Catastrophe, as popular as it was, probably had “half the numbers” of a comedy like Derry Girls. She’s dabbled in big studio films before, but in supporting roles, notably the 2018 comedy Game Night, with Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, and knows that these parts come with much less control than she’s used to. It appears that Horgan is nailing that hard-to-square feat of allying a rich, erse creative life with commercial success, but she’s unsure whether to focus her energies on acting or writing or producing or directing, or just to continue, like now, doing all of them.“The weird thing I fight in myself is going after a mainstream audience and also thinking that I’m not entirely sure I know how to write for a mainstream audience,” she says. “The sweet spot is to do that and to do it well. And to do it in a way that you’re not compromising. But there’s something very intoxicating about creating a show that has widespread appeal. You do want people to see your work.”At any point, Horgan might be working on a mind-boggling 30 projects. It’s hard not to trace this demented pace to the fact her career kicked off relatively late, in her mid-30s. She was born in east London, but moved to Ireland when she was four. The family settled in County Meath, north of Dublin, where they had a turkey farm. “I wanted to be a performer, but it didn’t feel possible,” she says. “I think that’s why it took so long. I mean, I had a lovely childhood and my parents were super-supportive, but if you’re brought up in a tiny village and your parents are turkey farmers, it doesn’t necessarily equate that you go into show business.”Horgan went to art college in Dublin, hung out with bands, did some backing singing. “At one gig, this crazy Swiss producer came up to me at the end and was like, ‘I’m gonna make you a star. So, I flew with him to Zurich and he spent the week doing publicity photos, introducing me to people and trying to find out what my talents were.” Horgan laughs, “So, after that week, I was like, ‘Oh well, this is what happens to me. People walk up to me and say, I’m going to make you a star.’ That handicapped me for years.”Instead, Horgan moved to London and worked at the Jobcentre in Kilburn, north London, for six years in her 20s. She only quit, aged 27, when she was instructed to pick up human excrement from the pavement outside. She moved around squats with Irish friends, before eventually renting a room in co-operative housing with a teacher and a nurse.“When I moved to London, I think I really was genuinely coming over not to make my fortune, but to be discovered,” she says. “And I literally just got a job in the Jobcentre. I don’t know who I thought was going to discover me there.”Horgan ultimately poured the energy of this chaotic, feckless period into Pulling, the sitcom she wrote with Dennis Kelly. She and Kelly had worked on sketches together in the 90s, won the BBC New Comedy Award in 2001, and began contributing material to Monkey Dust, Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye’s subversive animated series for BBC Three. The late Thompson (instrumental in launching Have I Got News For You and developing the character Ali G) had a sitcom title, Pulling, but no characters or plot, and suggested that Horgan and Kelly fill in the gaps.Pulling wasn’t exactly autobiographical, but some true stories found their way in: yes, Horgan once ate a takeaway she found in a phonebox. Around the time that Pulling was coming together, she met Jeremy Rainbird, who worked in advertising. Six months later she was pregnant, and not long after that they were married. They have two children, Sadhbh, 16, and Amer, 11. If some of this feels familiar, it might be because parts of it were the starting point for Catastrophe, which follows the characters Sharon and Rob from messy hook-up to messy, just different, life with children.We’re evicted from the “posh room” we’re in, which is needed for a meeting, so we scuttle across the landing to a writers’ space. It’s much smaller, there’s no view of the London Eye, and there’s a whiteboard on the wall and a sofa at one end. “There will be a bit of time where you run out of ideas and you just need to lie down,” she says.While writing Pulling and Catastrophe, she shared a single keyboard with Kelly and Delaney respectively she and Kelly would share the typing, but with Delaney it was always Horgan. It’s a draining way to work, but it has advantages: you receive immediate, brutal-if-necessary feedback, and there’s the drive of trying to make the other person laugh.There are occasional rumours that Catastrophe will return in some form, perhaps as a one-off special, but that’s not on Horgan’s schedule. “I’d love to write with Rob again,” she says. “We just fitted so well together. But we also spent five years writing something that was quite intense, and it’s good to step away and do other things. So I’m my own partner right now, and yeah, that’s OK.”Horgan considers Pulling and Catastrophe as chapter one and two of a trilogy. What form the third installment will take is something she’s wrestling with now. Both professionally and personally, 2019 was a tough year: Catastrophe ended, and so did her marriage to Rainbird. “After Catastrophe, I knew I’d have a period where I was like, ‘I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing,’” she says. “It was grand because I had so many other things, like Motherland and This Way Up and lots of Merman stuff, but I was also like, ‘Shit, I don’t have that thing. I don’t have that idea.’ And I was trying to not give myself a hard time about it, trying to just wait and see what came.”On Catastrophe, Horgan and Delaney abided by one directive: make nothing up. It was designed to stop them slipping into cliché, and however gruelling it is to stick to, Horgan thinks it’s worth it. “I feel when I write about what’s either going on in my life or has gone on in my life, I just connect to it way more, have more stuff to say,” she says. “It also provides me with a little extra therapy, getting stuff down on the page.“I really want to write about what it is to be a woman of a certain age whose life is changing,” she goes on. “And I want there to be a teenagers’ element to it. But I don’t want to write about my girls, because I think that’s just not fair. Also, I don’t want to start watching them the way I watch everyone else. You know, when you’re in the moment, but also part of your brain is thinking, ‘I must scribble that down later.’ So I’m trying to find a way round that, probably by giving the kids a different gender.”Horgan sounds like she is happiest when writing. “It’s like the ultimate escape,” she says. “You open your laptop and immediately you’re somewhere else.” But 2020 is already filling up. he’s in the film adaptation of the hit musical Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, and is about to start shooting a romantic comedy, the Last Drop, opposite Vince Vaughn. She’s also in advanced discussions to direct her first feature, The New World, an adaptation of Chris Adrian and Eli Horowitz’s sci-fi novel.“I just want some adventures,” she explains. “To do stuff that’s challenging. You can get into a bit of a rut in terms of what you write about and what your safe space is. So yeah, just take a few risks. It’s weird, with the directing thing, I’ve done it a few times, but every time I do it, I think I can’t do it. So it’s like ignoring the negative side of my brain and continuing to push it.“But then I also want to take my foot off the pedal a bit, so all that doesn’t make any sense,” Horgan continues. Then there’s that half-laugh again: “I want to get my daughter’s GCSEs out the way and come out the other side and have a happy, non-stressful home.”Military Wives is released on 6 MarchStyling by Frederika Lovelle Pank hair by Hamilton Stansfield at slreps using Philip B Haircare makeup by Justine Jenkins using Delilah Cosmetics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/719b49349bc428f9e14f8001c05c799bf31b0ee4/28_206_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=400adb2d1f356b7e2f80369cbbe98c51","title":"love island final emotions relief","story":"The dating show proved harder and harder to watch as it progressed, and not only because of the tragedy of 15 FebruaryEmotions were high during the Love Island final on Sunday, and the overwhelming one for many viewers was relief. For the past few weeks, fans have eagerly anticipated the show’s end, less out of excitement to see which of the couples would be awarded the grand prize of £50,000 than to mark the finish of what has been something of an ordeal.When the franchise’s winter edition started in January, it was uncharacteristically chilly, both in terms of the unseasonably cool South African climate and the lack of heat between contestants.Since its 2015 launch, Love Island has become one of ITV2’s most watched shows, through a combination of drama, FOMO and merch-ready catchphrases. Winter Love Island seemed doomed from the start, distinctly lacking in any of these.Launching just seven months after fans were still high from Amber Rose Gill and Greg O’Shea’s shock win, it was too much, too soon. This was evidenced by nearly a million fewer people tuning in compared to its 2019 launch episode. Caroline Flack’s death earlier this month then cast a long, dark shadow over the show’s final stages. Flack, the former presenter, was the fourth person associated with the show to have taken their own life in the past two years, after Sophie Gradon and her boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, in 2018 and Mike Thalassitis last year.Flack’s charm, and one of the show’s highlights, lay in giving off the impression she could have been an Islander herself. On Christmas Eve she wrote of the “scrutiny and speculation” she had faced after being charged with assault following an incident with her boyfriend. Much of the scrutiny took place in the tabloid press and on social media, a key component of the Love Island experience – the running commentary under the LoveIsland hashtag is another feature associated with the programme.When the show returned after a two-day hiatus following Flack’s suicide, retweeting memes and gags felt borderline disrespectful and even dangerous, given the nature of her passing. In an attempt to make it less so, JustEat sponsorship ads were swapped out with ones for mental health charity Mind.For a show that usually goes as deep as a dip in the villa pool, it weighed heavy. These issues are not Love Island-specific, but rather a symptom of wider issues regarding social media trolling and the quality of reality TV aftercare. But the show’s reliance on hashtags and Islanders to accrue as large an Instagram following as possible makes it particularly susceptible to online abuses.Moral arguments aside, Love Island has gone from being good-bad TV to bad-bad TV. Though the incentives for appearing on it have changed, its format has barely evolved. The near identical conveyor belt of Chrises and Jesses and Jacks have long been a running joke online, as producers certainly have a “type on paper”. “Twists” such as double dumpings and Casa Amor are as hackneyed as the obligatory end-of-series pool jump. In the show’s five-year history, not a single Islander has ever chosen to steal the money from their partner at the finale when given the option.By its end, when Finley Tapp and Paige Turley were crowned series winners, the hour-long episodes airing six nights a week had begun to feel like a test of endurance. Yet few lessons appear to have been learned. The 2020 summer series has already been confirmed. On Sunday, the most read article on the Mirror’s website involved contestant Shaughna Phillips looking “unrecognisable” after leaving the villa. In the same top five were two about Flack’s suicide. The show lost its magic long ago – now it has lost its chance to end on a high."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20ebc2bfac1377c7d9b602c5dac576baaf3e045c/0_0_2765_1659/master/2765.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cea775caafcfa8cb9454c82b0799f1d3","title":"patricia graces literary legacy giving maori characters their natural voice","story":"As Grace’s 1986 novel Potiki is republished in Britain, the writer talks about culture, politics and activism“We live by the sea, which hems and stitches the scalloped edges of the land,” writes New Zealand author Patricia Grace of the beachside town that is the setting for her novel, Potiki. The land in the book bears a striking resemblance to the settlement where Grace lives, and walking up the coastal road to her home in Hongoeka Bay, north of Wellington, you can see things the way her characters do: the dark morning sea, “strident bands” of gulls, and the capital’s notoriously “edged wind”.In 1975, Grace, now 82, was the first Māori woman to publish a book of short stories in New Zealand, despite the fact that she had not – by the time she finished high school – read a book by a local writer, let alone an Indigenous one.Potiki, the 1986 novel about a Māori community fighting to save its ancestral land from developers, has been relevant ever since New Zealand’s government continues to seize Māori land legally, even as it seeks to provide redress for what was taken in the past. More than two decades after the book’s publication, officials attempted to seize Grace’s own.Potiki will shortly be published as a Penguin Classic in Britain, an unusual prospect for a writer from New Zealand who was raised entirely on the works of Shakespeare and Milton but nothing that resembled “anything that was about me or where I lived or my culture”.When Grace eventually wrote novels, short stories, and children’s books about what she knew – the ordinary, everyday lives of Māori people and their families – she was surprised to be branded a political writer. At a time when stories about Māori honed in on social inequity – New Zealand’s Indigenous people fare worse than Pākehā (New Zealanders of European descent) on nearly every social and economic metric – Grace wrote instead about what she had seen growing up Māori: loving family and a close-knit community.“One comment that I had was that I wrote it to cause social unrest and racial disharmony,” she says of Potiki. “I wasn’t a very politicised person at all.”Besides, Grace says, laughing, those who levelled accusations at her of having made Māori “the good guys” of Potiki, and white New Zealanders “the bad guys”, did not realise she had never specified what race the greedy developers in the story were.Eventually, she had to fend off a real-life attempt on her land. In Hongoeka Bay – a quiet, sparkling curve of land, where the community is centred around the wharenui, a Māori word for a communal meeting house, and residents gather kai moana – seafood – from the beach, Grace lives in a light, airy, wooden house nestled into the hills.In 2014 Grace won a high-profile legal battle against the government, which wanted to purchase her land by force – under a law called the Public Works Act – to build an expressway. She is incredulous, she says, that such a law is still in force, even as an official tribunal seeks to settle claims with Māori tribes for land seized when the British colonised the country in the 19th century.“You can take anybody’s land, not only Māori land,” she says, referring to the Public Works Act. “But I know it’s being researched at the moment and I think we’ll find that a bigger percentage is Māori.”Reviews of Potiki were mixed when it was published in 1986, and some were condescending, she says.“One said that one day she might write a truly New Zealand novel,” says Grace. She thought the reviewer had meant a “bicultural” novel, one with more white people in it.Her use of the Māori language, known in New Zealand as te reo Māori, throughout the book had been intended “to alienate the readers”, critics said.“What I was really trying to do was having my characters speak in the way that was natural to them,” she says. She refused to include a glossary of Māori terms or italicise the book’s Māori words the year after Potiki’s publication, the Indigenous tongue became an official language of New Zealand.“I’d had a glossary in a previous work and then I suddenly thought that a glossary is there for foreign languages, italics are there for foreign languages,” she says. “I didn’t want Māori to be treated as a foreign language in its own country.”She didn’t mind the criticism, she says. It freed her to write “the way I wanted to write”.Softly spoken and self-effacing about her part in New Zealand’s literary canon, Grace agrees that books like Potiki helped to usher in change for the Māori language. Her grandparents’ generation was punished for speaking the Indigenous tongue, and her parents were not given the chance to learn.The tide began to turn following language activism in the 1970s and 80s – decades when Grace wrote prolifically. While earlier this century many assumed that the language would die out, it has in recent years experienced a resurgence.Grace started to learn the language as an adult, but had found it “very, very difficult” due to the painful legacy of missing out on it earlier, she says. “I think the best thing I’ve done is to encourage my children, and to babysit for them while they go and do courses and classes.”Grace has not, she says, kept track of the discussion in the global literary community about whether authors should write characters of different races to themselves, but encountered it early on in her career when she was wrongly accused of having said “that Pākehā writers should not write about Māori characters”, she says.She had simply said, she claims, that certain established writers had not depicted Māori people credibly, and faced harsh criticism for her remarks. Now, as a respected New Zealand author, she is sometimes contacted by other writers wanting her approval of how they have written Māori characters.“I just can’t deal with that, I’ll just send it all back,” she says, adding that the answer lay in research of other cultures, rather than prescriptive rules. “I’m not going to give anybody a tick. It’s up to them to do what they do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d80d3046ca85d15f7f572df24b7455637f615da/713_267_3109_1866/master/3109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=220186305ddd9b64b0fdcd17e6b40e87","title":"world is approaching coronavirus tipping point experts say","story":"78,000 cases confirmed, as Italy and Iran scramble to contain major outbreaksThe world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the coronavirus, according to experts, who warn that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it, after major outbreaks forced Italy and Iran to introduce stringent internal travel restrictions and South Korea’s president placed the country on red alert.Some of the countries most affected by the virus are scrambling to halt its progress two days after Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said the international community needed to act quickly before the narrowing “window of opportunity” closed completely.With almost 78,000 cases of Covid-19 now confirmed across the globe, experts say the situation will soon reach a critical threshold.In 11 north Italian towns, 50,000 people have been in lockdown since Friday night, with police patrolling the streets and fines imposed on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. In Iran, the authorities have ordered the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces as “a preventative measure”.On Sunday, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on “red alert” after it reported its sixth death and more than600 infections. And four of the 32 British and Irish Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers flown to the UK on Saturday have tested positive for Covid-19, the Chief Medical Officer for England said on Sunday. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 13.While the number of patients worldwide is increasing, some virus clusters have shown no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and an authority on the new coronavirus infection, echoed Tedros’s warning and said the time for containing the disease was running out.“The director general of the WHO has recently spoken of a narrowing of the window of opportunity to control the current epidemic,” he said. “The tipping point after which our ability to prevent a global pandemic ends seems a lot closer after the past 24 hours.”Hunter said that while cases were declining in China, where the outbreak began, the weekend had seen some “extremely concerning developments elsewhere”.He said the surge in South Korean cases had been unprecedented so far in the epidemic, adding: “The identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to be quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.”Hunter also said the situation in Iran could have major implications for the Middle East. “A further problem with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region,” he said.Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, pointed out that case numbers in Italy had doubled between Friday and Saturday. “This is an important stage of the coronavirus outbreak,” he said. “Fast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.”Two people have died from the virus in Italy since Friday and more than a hundred cases have now been reported, most of them centred around the small town of Codogno, about 40 miles south-east of Milan.Those living in the affected areas now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival were cancelled and Milan fashion week was also affected.Iran has recorded eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases, bringing the overall number of infections to 43. Four new infections surfaced in the capital, Tehran, seven in the city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said.Pakistan responded by closing its land border with Iran, while Afghanistan said it was suspending travel to Iran “to prevent the spread of the novel \u001dcoronavirus and protect the public”. Turkey also closed its borders and said it would halt incoming flights, adding that all motorways and railways at the border would be shut on Sunday afternoon.Jordan, meanwhile, will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly outbreak.Announcing his decision to raise South Korea’s alert level on Sunday, Moon said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take “unprecedented, powerful” measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by “regulations”.As his country struggled to contain theoutbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as “a very important moment”, the news agency Yonhap said. Of the 123 new cases, 75 were related to the Shincheonji church in Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city, and a neighbouring hospital.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers had been screened for the virus.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.The raising of the alert level came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country’s management of the outbreak.Warning that China’s virus epidemic was “still grim and complex,” the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called on Sunday for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting the spring planting of crops. Xi defended the ruling Communist party’s response as “timely and effective” in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the Xinhua news agency.“The current epidemic situation is still grim and complex,” Xinhua cited Xi as saying. “Prevention and control are at the most critical stage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99aaf9c56b40a068b0c49920291176d9460bd54e/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d83b42c86cca28fdb36d1589ab247a3","title":"british tourists stranded in canary islands after saharan sandstorm blows in","story":"Dozens of flights have been cancelled due to poor visibility, leaving holidaymakers stuck at airportsBritish holidaymakers have been stranded at airports in the Canary Islands after a Saharan sandstorm left the holiday destination coated with dust, reducing visibility for aircraft.Flights from Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, North and South Tenerife airports have been grounded for the foreseeable future due to the weather conditions.Customer service staff for the airports said that while no planes were flying, airports have remained open for passengers.Passengers were advised to contact airline and try to get accommodation for the night if their flight was cancelled.Passengers have posted photographs of people sitting on the floor waiting for more information.Greg Horsman, 29, was on holiday with his girlfriend and his friends on a Tui cruise and was due to fly home to Manchester on Saturday evening.However, they have been forced to stay in Gran Canaria for another two nights due to the storm.“It’s frustrating. We’re just ready to be home,” he said.“There should be contingency plans for when a weather event grounds flights. They all kept saying ‘Oh we’ve never seen this happen before’ which I understand, it’s a freak of nature, but when weather grounds all flights there is surely a contingency plan that gets put into place so people can get accommodation sorted.”Graham Whiteman, 30, arrived at Las Palmas airport at 5pm on Saturday night, but discovered his Tui flight back to Doncaster – which he was due to be on with his fiancee and her family – had been cancelled.He said: “We were told we needed to check the boards for updates.“We didn’t get any and then at 1.30am we found a Tui rep, who then sorted us out with a hotel room on the other side of the island at 4am.“We got an email at 7.58am saying a coach would be leaving the hotel at 8.30am to take us to the airport and we’ve been here ever since.”He added: “I am type one diabetic and when I explained to a Tui rep that I will not have enough insulin for the next 24 hours, their response was that they would deal with it when it becomes an emergency.“The duty of care for their customers is a disgrace, they do not want to take responsibility for anything or anyone. Children and elderly adults having no option but to sit and sleep on the dirty airport floors.”A spokeswoman for Tui said: “We would like to sincerely apologise to customers for the disruption caused by the adverse and changeable weather conditions. The safety of our customers and crew is always our highest priority and we are working tirelessly to find the best solutions for all our customers.”Elsewhere, Britons have posted photographs of the orange sky on the islands as the wind continued to batter seaside towns.Michael Nixon, who is on holiday in Tenerife with his family to celebrate his 50th birthday and is due to fly home to Newcastle on Wednesday, said “pink dust” had covered his rented apartment balcony.He said: “It’s all a bit surreal. A heavy mist came in last night followed by very strong gusty winds during the night. This morning we awoke to yellowish haze and strong winds. “We ventured out but it’s difficult to see with all of the sand in the air. We are slightly concerned that our flight home on Wednesday could be affected.”Meanwhile in the UK, flights out to the Canary Islands are being delayed or cancelled due to the sandstorm."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178442.1582119437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"libraries remarkable places we should cherish","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish libraries have shown themselves to be wonderfully deft at moving with changing times.If something seems too good to be true, then it is too good to be true has long been a guiding principal of this page. It is has served us well for many years as we have steered people - and sometimes ourselves - away from the latest scam or cautioned readers against falling for “bargains” which turn out to be ginormous rip offs. But there is an exception to this golden rule. Our libraries. By almost every single measure we can think of, Irish libraries are remarkable places and something we should cherish and support in every convievable sense. Many people seem to agree. The level of consensus about the importance of libraries became very clear to us last week when we asked Twitter a simple question. This is what we asked: “Do you think libraries have relevance today or are they an out-of date throwback to times past?”Within hours we had received close to a thousand responses, the vast, vast majority of which were singing the praises of our libraries. Many of the resposes were a joy to read and an affirmation that in a world that sometimes seems to be drowing in technolgy-fuelled toxicity there is a place for pleasant positivity. There was also - sadly - much evicdence of that technology-fuelled toxicity too. In fact some people were gravely offended that we would have the temerity to pose the question.“Just reading the tone of this question annoyed me,” one Twitter user responded. “It takes a single Google to discover the sheer vast social power libraries bring. To every organisation and group they touch.”“If you’re asking, you’re out of touch,” another user said. “How could you even ask that question?” wondered someone else. Our question was called daft and one person said they were so angered by it that they would most certainly not be reading any subsequent article on the topic that Pricewtch might write.Most of the others who responded were not so annoyed and were happy to be given the opportuntiy to rave about their local libraries and the wider system as it operates across the country.Terrible mistakeBut here’s the thing. If an alien were to fall to earth and only read the responses to the question we posed on Twitter they would be forgiven for thinking that the vast, vast majority of Irish people genuinely cherish their libraries and use them all the time. But that is not the case, not by a long shot. Rather than cherish our libraries and take advantage of all they have to offer the vast majority of Irish people seem, in fact, happier to turn their backs on them entirely. The numbers don’t lie. Less than 20 per cent of Irish people describe themselves as regular library users which means that more than three million people in this country rarely or never use libraries. The three million are making a terrible mistake. They are missing out on free books – both physical and electronic – free internet access, free DVDs, free Wi-Fi, free self-improving talks, free readings, free newspapers, free magazines and free book clubs. We could go on and on and on. In fact there’s so much free stuff going in the close to 400 libraries around the country that it is hard to know where to start. Actually, it’s easy to know where to start. We should start at the National Library Open Day which takes place this coming Saturday in a library near you. The Open Day is “a special invitation to everyone to come in and see for themselves all that’s on offer at their local library” and as part of the event, libraries across the country will showcase some of the services they offer and will have “friendly staff on hand to join you up and show you around in-library and online services”. It is a brilliant idea and one which should be embraced by everyone. Among the experiences on offer in libraries on Saturday will be a comic illustration workshop and lace making demonstration in Carlow 3D printing and a chance to meet robots in South Dublin a board game bonanza, Lego club and ‘Match Attax Meet Up’ in Cork city. There is a ukulele workshop in Co Cork and a slime workshop in Co Westmeath. That is not all. There will be the chance to play with virtual reality, sow sunflowers and take part in a treasure hunt in Co Wexford. A library in Co Galway will be offering free health checks while there will be chair exercise classes in Co Leitrim. And did we mention that everything which will take place in many of the 330 librries around the State is free? Despite the fact that most people in Ireland seem happy to turn their backs on libraries these are good times for the precious resources. There were over 17 million visits to Irish libraries in 2018, and nearly 14 million items were issued that year. ChangeThey have shown themselves to be wonderfully deft at moving with changing times and give access to more than 500 e-learning courses and 114 language courses. There are 28,000 e-books available and 20,000 e-audio books, as well as 300 international magazine titles and 3,200 accessible newspapers.People who have not set foot inside a library since they last read about Aunt Fanny dispensing lashings of ginger beer and tongue sandwiches to beat the band while Uncle Quentin glowered in his study might, in fact, be shocked by how much libraries have changed since they gave up on them.One big change in recent times has meant that when you join one library in Ireland today you join all of them . You can now order online and pick up a book in Dublin and leave in back in Donegal - the first such library set up in the world. You can browse and download eBooks, audiobooks, eMagazines and e-Newspapers on your phone or other device. There is access to equipment including virtual reality, 3D printing, sensory equipment and laptops. There is free internet access, space to study, work or read and relax, resources to support people looking for work or setting up businesses and information for those interested in local history.And while libraries are about so much more than money, that is to be saved too? How much? Well, an avid reader can cut costs quite a bit by joining a library. Even if you buy a newly released paperback for a tenner – and many cost more than that – by reading five a month someone could handily spend over €700 a year on books, most of which they will only read once.With all the benefits it is a wonder that just 16 per cent of the population are active members of the library.Maybe things will change though. That is certainly the aim of the National Library Strategy which wants to see membership grow to 30 per cent in the next few years. Growing numbersStrategies that have been put in place so far to grow the numbers include the extension of opening hours to better suit busy lives and the removal of late fees and fines to ensure everyone has access to services without fear of penal charges. The strategy aims to expand self-service facilities and widen the My Local Library scheme - a self service system which currently is open 8am – 10pm 365 days a year - to 100 library branches across the country and then 200 branches over the next decade. The strategy will also see greater investment in digital technologies to enhance the service and to bridge the digital ide by developing digital learning centres and offering STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths) and coding workshops. It also seeks to “firmly establish the library as a welcoming, go-to-place locally with skilled staff providing guidance and support and access to communal spaces, services and resources for all people and communities”.While we get many things very wrong in Ireland - and Pricewatch is rarely found wanting when it comes to highlighting the bad stuff - libraries are one thing we appear to be getting very right. Some countries, including the UK and US, have experienced severe cuts to their library services over the past decade which have resulted in reduced library use and book lending, reduced opening hours and library closures.By contrast, in Ireland between 2012 and 2017 there were 45 new or extended library branches and more are planned while expenditure on stock increased by 15 per cent from 2012 to 2016. The last budget saw an increase of investment in libraries from €6.2 million to €7.2 million while almost €3.5 million has been committed from Government to date for the My Open Library scheme and is being matched by local authorities to the value of around €1 million giving a total investment of almost €4.5 million. What our libraries need more than money is your support. If you are one of the millions who are not a member, do something good this week and join up. You’ll be glad you did. There is no question about that. The librarian’s view: ‘It is a joy to work here’If Pricewatch sounds enthusiastic about libraries, then listen to executive librarian from Waterford Libraries Tracy McEneaney talk for a few minutes. “Libraries are for every single person. Everyone who is a member realises how great the service is and we rely on word of mouth to a huge degree. Membership is free and we have abolished the fines that might have been putting people off and also widened the service so when you join one library you are a member of all the libraries so you can take a book out in Waterford and return it in Donegal.”“We have all the best sellers and e-books are a big thing for us now and work with an app called borrowbox. You select your library, input your library number and pin and download the books or audio books you fancy. It is that simple and it is free. I sometimes go to funerals and people will come up to me and tell me that borrowbox kept their granny going. It is lovely to hear that. “And it is not just books we have electronically. We have almost 500 magazines from the New Yorker and the Economist down to Hello available and they are all free. It is brilliant and 10 or 20 years ago none of this stuff was available.“They are not quiet places anymore and the nosiest people are likely to be the librarians and we don’t really shush people. Libraries have become community hubs and there is always something going on. There are thousands of events across the country from talks and book clubs to yoga and health eating workshops. “We get to know our customers – especially in the smaller braches and we know all about the births and the deaths and the hardships and the joys. Come in and ask us what we have on offer. We are practically pulling people off the street. It is a joy to work in a library. But we have to reach the people in Ireland who maybe have not been in a library since they were children. It is great when people come back. I love seeing people who I remember as babies brining their own children through the doors. My message to people would be simply be if you haven’t been to a library in years come back and have a lookYour view: ‘Libraries have never been more relevant’“My local library was a godsend when I was completing my 2 Dissertations in my final year of college.. staff were great too. If I needed a book for reference and it was in another branch they’d transfer it.. Definitely still a much needed \u0026amp wanted facility,” - Babs McMahon “I love the library and withdraw books regularly,” - Oonagh Duggan“They are great resource and learning centres,” - Michael Kelly“I can read all the local and national papers there, and they have book clubs and reading author events. PCs and printers are always busy. Relevant? Never more relevant,” - Frank Smith“The library system in Ireland is brilliant. I am now effective a member of every library. I order my books on their website, they are delivered from whatever library they are in, I get a text to collect them in the local library. I’ve stopped buying books. Our local library at Kevin Street is much loved - refurbished a couple of years ago, it’s a really welcoming place, always busy, and staffed by the loveliest people. I also often drop in to the Cavan Town library, which is brilliant. A sign of civilisation,” - Patricia Reilly“The library in Clonakilty is buzzing with people from the direct provision centre in town, people who don’t have desktop computers using the internet, kids \u0026amp all sorts of other people using it’s many facilities - they’re community hubs, in rural towns at least,” - Beth Wallace“I use my library weekly. My kids love it. They always have books rented out. I order books I want to rent from the library through their website. They e-mail me when they come in. I wish they would open on a Saturday though,” - Guillaume L’Hiver“So relevant and vital - real, untainted information in a peaceful place of refuge,” - Gerr Walsh “I’d a granda who would go every Saturday and get his five novels and read them in a week. That wasn’t a rarity back then. But how society entertains itself has changed. Libraries have had to adapt to that. They seem to be doing a great job of this in the face of severe adversity,” - Abby Oliveira“Granted I work in a library but it’s not a public library. Public libraries are one of the most human and democratic social spaces. I love mine,” - Ger Gregory“How dare you even question their relevance,” - Eoin Murphy“I run a lunchtime bookclub in an inner city disadvantaged secondary school. Cabra library supplies us with the books and has been so helpful. We’re currently reading Pride and Prejudice. It’s a real life line for the students- couldn’t run it without the support of the library,” - Lorraine Ni Mhathuna“Completely relevant. They are more than just book lending facilities, they are community learning and information centres offering facilities people may not have access to at home. They’re also one of the few places people can sit indoors for free,” - Bessie Burgers“I use mine weekly! So relevant and important. Such a great community hub,” - Melanie May“If it wasn’t for one of the local well stocked libraries running a University outreach course, I’d wouldnt be a mature student in TCD right now. Dublin City Libraries doesn’t get a lot of credit or recognition for the stellar work it does in communities that are otherwise bereft of books,” - Mark Egan “A place where kids and teenagers (anyone indeed) can go and get books without having to ask for money for it or have anyone breathing down their neck about it is the kind of freedom that’s getting a bit too scarce these days,” - Stephen Bourke“I would be LOST without my library!!! I am an avid reader. I get a new book for my birthday and Christmas. Besides that I get books at my local library once every few weeks.

Ryanair said that flights to and from Milan were continuing as normal.Aer Lingus said that it was “monitoring the situation and following all guidelines from the relevant authorities in relation to this issue”.Meanwhile, two Irish citizens have arrived at a quarantine block near Liverpool in England after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan. They were among a group of 32 people – the rest of whom are British nationals – who arrived at the centre on Saturday. Four of the group have tested positive for coronavirus, according to British officials.Across the world, the number of cases of the virus, Covid-19, has begun to mount. South Korea went on high alert after the number of infections surged over 600, with six deaths. Iran has reported 43 cases, with eight deaths.A third fatality in Italy, on Sunday, was an elderly woman from the town of Crema, east of Milan, who was also suffering from cancer.Crucial stageIn China, which has seen the vast majority of cases, authorities reported 648 new infections – higher than a day earlier – but only 18 were outside of Hubei province, the lowest number outside the epicentre since authorities began publishing data a month ago and locked down large parts of the country.President Xi Jinping said that while measures to deal with the virus had been effective, the battle to contain it was still at a crucial stage. State run television urged people to avoid complacency, drawing attention to people gathering in public areas and tourist spots without wearing masks.The virus has killed 2,442 people in China, which has reported 76,936 cases, and has cut growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Since January, it has spread to 26 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen.It has been fatal in 2 per cent of reported cases, with the elderly and ill the most vulnerable, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), which said on Saturday it was worried by the detection of infections without a clear link to China.The three airports that serve Milan, including Bergamo – where Ryanair has a base – continued their services as normal at the weekend.Lombardy and Veneto said they would close schools for a week beginning on Monday while the affected regions postponed carnivals, football matches and fashion shows."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4182681.1582494039!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"preparations under way for st patrick s day programme in washington","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAdvanced discussions have taken place between Irish officials and the White House about a meeting between the taoiseach and US president Donald Trump in the oval office on Thursday, March 12th, followed by the annual shamrock ceremony in the White House. Photograph: Getty ImagesPreparations are under way for the annual St Patrick’s Day programme in Washington despite the political stalemate arising from the general election.Advanced discussions have taken place between Irish officials and the White House about a meeting between the taoiseach and US president Donald Trump in the oval office on Thursday, March 12th, followed by the annual shamrock ceremony in the White House.It is also expected that the speaker’s lunch on Capitol Hill will take place that day, which will be hosted by house speaker Nancy Pelosi. Breakfast with vice- president Mike Pence at his residence in North West Washington is also in the process of being scheduled with the taoiseach of the day.With the next vote to elect a taoiseach expected to take place on March 5th, it is unclear if a new leader will be in place in time for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations a week later.It is envisaged that Leo Varadkar will make the trip to Washington if he remains in the position of taoiseach at that time.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald is due in Washington the week beginning March 10th, regardless of the outcome of government-formation talks. Ms McDonald attended the St Patrick’s Day celebrations in the White House last year, and was also guest of honour at Sinn Féin’s main fundraising dinner in New York in November.There will also be a strong representation of politicians from Northern Ireland that week. First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill will be the guests of honour at the annual St Patrick’s Day breakfast hosted by the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington.It marks the first time in three years the two leading politicians from the North will attend that event in their official capacity following the restoration of the power-sharing executive. PrioritisedGovernment officials indicated that the St Patrick’s Day festivities in Washington will be prioritised even if government-formation talks are ongoing. However, the programme may be shorter than in previous years when the taoiseach typically visited at least one other US city.One possibility being explored is a visit to Boston following the March 12th main programme of events. The city is due to hold its annual parade on Sunday, March 15th. An event is also scheduled at the United Nations on Tuesday, March 10th, as part of Ireland’s bid to win a seat on the UN Security Council, which could also be attended by the taoiseach or a senior minister.Another event scheduled to take place in Washington during the week beginning March 10th is the annual Ireland Funds dinner. This year the philanthropic body, which raises money for organisations across the island of Ireland, will honour Ms Pelosi. Peter King, a New York congressman who is retiring this year, will also receive a special recognition award at the March 11th dinner, which is expected to be attended by the taoiseach and several members of Congress.

The one-time Conservative Party chairman, now Lord Patten, said the Tory government’s proposed points-based immigration system - unveiled last week and aimed at reducing the number of lower-paid EU workers - would cause problems for the UK’s healthcare, agrifood and hospitality sectors.Mr Patten said that tackling EU migration has always been “an easy way for politicians appearing to tackle the issue in a firm way which can satisfy popular sentiment” when most immigration comes from outside the EU.“Stopping more people coming in seasonally to pick potatoes and stopping the recruitment of Romanians to work at very low pay in care homes isn’t a very sophisticated way of dealing with labour market problems,” he told The .Speaking ahead of delivering a lecture in Dublin on Tuesday evening, Mr Patten said that future labour market shortages as a result of declining fertility rates and ageing populations in Europe would not be solved with a “few simple slogans or catching a few headlines”.Mr Patten, a vociferous opponent of Brexit, described this “big demographic problem” as “a much more sophisticated and awkward issue” that could not be solved by “any European country on its own, even Britain outside the European Union”.‘Weird’ mafia The former senior Tory criticised the powerful role given by British leader Boris Johnson to his iconoclastic adviser Dominic Cummings. He described the aide as the “capo of the weirdos” - a reference to Mr Cummings inviting “weirdos and misfits” to apply to work at Downing Street.Mr Patten said Mr Cummings had “astonishing influence” at No 10 and across the government. He questioned the motivation behind plans by Downing Street to take on the judiciary, abolish the BBC licence fee and challenge other institutions that hold the governing executive to account.“There is an agenda to eliminate any impediments to the exercise of executive authority in the name of majoritarianism,” he said. He called Downing Street’s anti-establishment plans an “assault” on institutions that could impede “whatever it is that an executive under dominant No 10 control wants to do”.“You have precious few institutions left which can actually stand up to a government which is doing crazy things,” said the former chairman of the BBC.“Even active politicians” who point out difficulties with actions being taken by the prime minister “have a very short shelf life”, he added.Smith sackingHe pointed to Mr Johnson’s sacking of Julian Smith as Northern Ireland secretary because he “intellectually disagreed” with an uncompromising prime minister by contradicting him on Brexit and warning that a no-deal exit would be bad for Northern Ireland. Mr Patten, who chaired the body that transformed the Royal Ulster Constabulary into the Police Service of Northern Ireland, described Mr Smith as the best Northern secretary “for years”. He blamed the UK government for reneging on commitments given to the EU in the political declaration by hardening its position before talks begin on a post-Brexit trade agreement. There was still a view in the Tory government that “cakeism rules, as though we can have our cake and eat it - alas, that is not true,” he said. If a trade deal is reached, it will be because the UK has “backed down” as London did on the Irish Border issue by agreeing to have a trade border in the Irish Sea.The British peer, now chancellor of Oxford University, will be speaking on “The Future of Liberal Democracy” in St Anne’s Church on Tuesday night in a lecture organised by Studies, the quarterly journal published by the Jesuits, in honour of the late businessman Peter Sutherland. Mr Patten said that he has found the Brexit era of British politics “the most depressing period of my life and it goes beyond politics”. He said his children were “uniformly hostile” to Brexit “not because of any exaggerated enthusiasm for European institutions, but they just can’t understand why a pretty reasonable example of international cooperation with our neighbours, is somehow now regarded as treachery”.“I find it difficult to be anything other than exceptionally skeptical about the idea that Britain unbound is going to become a great global powerhouse as though we haven’t been important globally for centuries. I mean we have,” he said.  Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

more votes than any other Democratic presidential candidate in Iowa, New Hampshire and now Nevada. That really is remarkable in a field that began with more than two dozen contenders and still numbers in the high single figures. It suggests there is nothing illusory about the connection the 78-year-old democratic socialist has with a cohort of voters. That includes white, working class men - a group that went for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. What the Nevada caucuses indicate, however, is that Mr Sanders has an ability to build a coalition of voters beyond the narrow section that is typically associated with him. Entrance polls showed that Mr Sanders won 51 per cent of Hiic voters - a remarkable statistic. In other words, more than ever other candidate put together. He also, according to the polls, won a quarter of African-American voters, a demographic he struggled with in his bid for the presidency four years ago. If there was doubt before Nevada, there is no longer - Bernie is the front-runner in this race. Those seeking to unpack the Sanders phenomenon have many theories to grasp. But one, surely, which cannot be overlooked is the fact that Democrats really do like Medicare-for-all. Entrance polls - based on what people are thinking just before they go in to vote - taken in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada all show the much-debated proposal is popular. The breakdown was 57 per cent support to 38 per cent opposition in Iowa, 58 per cent to 37 per cent in New Hampshire and 62 per cent to 35 per cent in Nevada, according to NBC polls. Yet for all its popularity, only two candidates in the race are promising Medicare-for-all. Mr Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and fellow progressive. Even between them, it is Mr Sanders who wrote the proposed legislation - claiming often on the trail “I wrote the damn bill” - while Ms Warren frames the policy as more of a medium-term goal. For moderates, opposition to the plan, which gives government-funded healthcare to all Americans and scraps private insurance, has been a stick with which to beat Mr Sanders. Maybe they misread the party’s base? “The comeback kid!” shouted someone from the crowd as Joe Biden gave his results night speech in Nevada, echoing the nickname Bill Clinton gave himself during his 1992 primaries comeback. That was certainly the message being pushed by the Biden camp as the former US vice president put in a much improved performance in the third state to vote in the race. Following his fourth and fifth place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr Biden came in the top three here - a relative improvement that allows his team to claim momentum. “The press is ready to declare people dead quickly.” Mr Biden told his supporters. “But we\u0027re alive and we\u0027re coming back and we\u0027re going to win!”Whether the years-long front-runner failing to win any of the first three states really is positive news is another question. But the freefall narrative will be over for now. Entrance polls showed he won among African-American voters, getting 36 per cent to Mr Sanders’s 25 per cent.  It is now all on South Carolina.If Mr Biden wins there - as he said on Saturday that he would - the comeback narrative will be fully up and running. But fall short and it looks bad for Super Tuesday. In the last fortnight the two leading women still in the race had the strongest moments of their campaigns.For Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator and moderate, it was coming in a strong third place in New Hampshire, winning a fifth of the votes and leading to claims of Klobmentum. For Ms Warren, it was her brutal take-down of billionaire Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, challenging him on nondisclosure agreements, that breathed new life into her bid. But in Nevada, neither got the breakout success they would have been dreaming about, failing to break into the top three.For both candidates and others lower down the table one big question begins to loom - how long can they realistically stay in the race? Both will remain on the ballot for South Carolina and likely for Super Tuesday, when 14 different states vote. But something dramatic will need to change to progress beyond that. An outsider septuagenarian who exudes authenticity and pitches bold policies versus a string of moderates all battling to be the centrist torch-bearer, thereby splitting the vote. That was the story of Donald Trump’s unlikely path through the Republican primaries on his way to the White House in 2016 and is starting to become the story of this cycle too. While Mr Sanders romped home to victory in Nevada, the vote for the moderates - or the Stop Bernie wing, as they could be called - was split every which way. Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend mayor, got a sizable chunk of the vote. So did Mr Biden. Ms Klobuchar got some votes, though not lots. And that is all before Mr Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has poured close to half a billion dollars into advertising, jumps into the race on Super Tuesday. Who should be the leading moderate? That is now the critical question in the race. The answer is Democratic voters just do not seem to know, for now at least. The longer it is Mr Sanders versus a split field of centrists, the better for him - just like Mr Trump in 2016, when the failure to coalesce around one opponent eased his path to victory. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont forgive no peace afghans talibans birthplace back nascent","story":"Every phase of Afghanistan\u0027s four decades of war has left traces around the rocky Ghargi police outpost overlooking the Panjwayi district of Kandahar.Rusting tanks sinking into the stony slopes date to when Soviet troops battled Mujahideen in the surrounding orchards and vineyards.A brief drive away is Sangisar, the birthplace of the Taliban where Mullah Omar first raised his militia of religious students to fight the warlords who thrived after the Russians left. More recent sandbagged trenches and bullet-pocked buildings date to when Western troops fought the Taliban.For the past seven years, the outpost has been manned only by local Afghan police who guard the mobile phone towers. The years of fighting have extracted a heavy cost from the people of Panjwayi.Haji Mohammad Rassoul, a local elder, has lost a brother, a police chief in nearby Shorabak district, and a son, also a policeman.“I am preparing food for their children,” he said over a lunch of mutton and aubergine. “Every home is like that.”Eighteen months of negotiation in Doha between America and the Taliban have produced the beginnings of a peace process. A seven-day semi-truce has begun, which if it holds will tee-up a formal accord on February 29. United States troops will begin to withdraw and the militants will sit down with Afghan leaders to begin what will be lengthy and difficult talks on how to run the country. Diplomats are cautious, but say the accord is the best chance yet the country has had to find a political settlement to the conflict.The United Nations\u0027 latest tally of civilian casualties found the conflict killed or injured around 10,400 people last year.Haji Mohammad recalls well when the Taliban first arose in the area in the autumn of 1994, in response to the lawlessness of what was then a civil war.At first they were welcomed as they disarmed bandits and secured the countryside. Later their punishments, including hangings and the cutting off of thieves\u0027 hands, and their rules and austere interpretation of Islam began to alienate residents.“They had good security, but nothing more. They ruled by cruelty,” Haji Mohammad said.Despite that, he would welcome them if they were to join Afghan politics and lay down their weapons.“If I don\u0027t forgive them, then peace can\u0027t come again,” he said.The Taliban\u0027s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, last week used the opinion pages of the New York Times to try to reassure the West about the group\u0027s intentions.Haqqani, a wanted terrorist known for ordering car bombings, said the militants now wanted an “inclusive political system” and they would guarantee women their Islamic rights to study and work.No one the  spoke to wanted a return to the strict governance of a Taliban-led government. But some kind of power-sharing or admittance to parliament could work, they suggested.“If they come and join the government, then we don\u0027t have a problem,” said another police commander, Abdullah Khan, from his outpost overlooking Zangiabad.Some predicted the Taliban were no longer as strict as at their founding. “I think that this next time, they will be changed,” said 60-year-old Abdul Ghafur. “They will not insist that people have big beards and turbans and stop girls from going to school.”Whether Panjwayi\u0027s women were as confident was unclear. Few could be seen during the \u0027s visit.The residents also have mixed feelings about the foreign troops in the country.In Panjwayi the thousands of first Canadian and then American troops who patrolled from 2006 onwards are blamed for making violence worse, not better.Local people liken the Taliban to flies attracted to foreign troops. Americans built the large district compound centre from where the deputy police chief, Nasar Mohammad, now leads his men.The walls are still the bland beige found in all such buildings, but he has added his own touches.A greenhouse holds his collection of flowers. A corner of the compound where armoured vehicles once parked is now an enclosure for his menagerie of iridescent pheasants and small deer.He entertains guests on carpets laid where US combat boots once crunched over gravel.The chief voices a familiar criticism of foreign forces. With all their technology and might, why were they unable to defeat a rag-tag band of religious students?“It was very easy for the Americans to push the Taliban out, but they did not want to. They said their cameras meant they could see something tiny all the way from Kandahar airport, thirty miles away. Why couldn\u0027t they do anything in Panjwayi?” he said.He himself would be keen to see the back of foreign troops as part of any deal.Others point to the 1990s, when the world\u0027s abandonment of Afghanistan after the Cold War allowed it to fall into civil war. They say they want Americans to stay, albeit conducting aid work, not fighting.Security in central Panjwayi has already improved. The replacement of troops by locally recruited police had smoothed over tribal differences that fanned the insurgency, residents said. During the American time, Nasar Mohammad said he had often needed a convoy of up to 40 armoured vehicles to cross his territory.Now he simply jumps in a car and he has not lost a man in Panjwayi for seven years.Much of the rest of Afghanistan is not so fortunate though, and illustrating the shifting patchwork of the conflict, he said there were heavy casualties in neighbouring Maiwand.If this week\u0027s truce holds, then talks between the Taliban and Afghan leaders are scheduled to begin quickly, in either Norway or Germany. Those talks are likely to be the most difficult part of any peace process. Ashraf Ghani\u0027s government has so far been shut out of negotiations, with the Taliban rejecting him as a US puppet. As US troops withdraw, his negotiating hand weakens. Moreover Afghanistan\u0027s politicians are currently at loggerheads over the disputed result of September\u0027s presidential election.Mr Ghani was declared victor, only for his rival Abdullah Abdullah to reject the result and threaten a rival government. Just choosing who should negotiate with the Taliban is expected to be fraught. Rogue Taliban factions, Islamic State group and even players in the government may try to sabotage the talks. Diplomats caution that talks could take years, if they do not grind to a halt.Yet in Panjwayi, where the summer heat is already rising and the fields will soon be thick with grapes and pomegranates, residents are also hoping to see shoots of peace.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italian towns lockdown 155 test positive","story":"Eleven Italian towns were on lockdown due to coronavirus on Sunday night as three deaths were attributed to the disease following a dramatic surge in cases.Austria stopped all train services on Italy on Sunday night over concerns about the spread of the virus. The “extraordinary measures”, announced by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte”, came as a frantic search was launched to find the elusive “patient zero” believed to have spread the virus, making Italy the first European country to deal with a significant outbreak.Under the decree, approximately 50,000 people are now banned from leaving or entering the zones across the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto without permission.At least 155 people have now tested positive for the virus, meaning Italy now has the fifth most cases of any country in the world.The outbreak stoked fears that coronavirus could be carried into the UK by tourists returning from the ski resorts of the two northern provinces for half term holidays, although the Foreign Office does not believe any British citizens are trapped inside the quarantined towns themselves.Despite Italy now having more confirmed cases than four of the Asian countries on the Department of Health’s coronavirus watchlist, officials yesterday declined to update their vigilance advice to include it.The new cases prompted the closure of schools and universities and forced Giorgio Armani to cancel its centre-piece runway show as Milan Fashion Week was thrown into chaos.Meanwhile authorities cut short the Venice Carnival by two days, and cancelled the Scotland-Italy Women’s Six Nations clash.The match had been scheduled to take place in Legnano, north of Milan.Three men\u0027s Serie A football matches were also called off, including Inter Milan\u0027s hosting of Sampdoria.Announcing the lockdown on Sunday, Mr Conte said: “We have adopted a decree to protect the health of Italians, which is our priority and which ranks first in the list of constitutional values.”He urged people to “have faith in the political and scientific institutions, which are doing everything possible”.The government-imposed quarantine in Lombardy and Veneto, which will last for at least two weeks.Milan\u0027s Duomo Cathedral has been closed to tourists and mass has been suspended. People in Milan, and Lombardy yesterday lined up outside supermarkets and grocery shops, where fresh meat, fruit and vegetables are becoming increasingly scarce. Masks and hand disinfectants sold out almost everywhere in the northern regions of Italy.National and local authorities remained adamant yesterday that there is currently no risk of pandemic and that all the quarantine measures have been taken to avoid further contagion and to contain the virus within the so-called red zones.Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy\u0027s Civil Protection Department, told reporters that 110 of the confirmed cases were in Lombardy, with 21 in Veneto with others in Emilia-Romagna and Lazio.He also confirmed that the patient suspected to have spread the virus had not yet been identified.The 38-year-old man who was the first case of infection registered in Lombardy had not himself been to China, but was in contact with a colleague who was there in late January.The colleague has tested negative to the new coronavirus, however.“Unfortunately, the person who was considered to be ‘patient zero’ was not,” said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy.“We need to look elsewhere. We are following two hypotheses, and we will try to understand if one of the two is correct.”Officials reported the third death on Sunday, an elderly woman from the town of Crema who had been suffering from cancer.  The Lombardy region announced on Sunday morning that all schools, including universities in Italy’s financial capital Milan – will be closed until further notice.The Veneto region also closed schools, fairs, museums, and suspended public events, including Venice’s world-known Carnival celebrations, until March 1.  Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia (UEA), told The : The identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy yesterday is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to by quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.“All the evidence from elsewhere in the world is that the first day seems bad but it pales into insignificance by day three.“What is worrying is that it is spreading quite quickly over a large area, and they don’t know how it started.Reports emerged yesterday of scuffles prompted by the lockdown after shoppers were made to queue outside and then only allowed in in small groups to stock up on provisions.One man in the town of Casalpusterlengo, a 10-minute drive from Codogno, thought to be the epicentre of the north Italian outbreak, said: “It’s inhuman. Fighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monkeyface prickleback fish could save planet","story":"An unusual, protein-packed fish could hold the key to saving the planet, according to scientists at the University of California.The vegetarian fish, which is known as the monkeyface prickleback, has been described as the new white meat and could help feed the world.Living in the rocky waters off the West Coast of the US, the fish can grow to three-foot in length and prefers to lurk in reefs and tidal pools. Weighing about six pounds, it has two small fins hanging like floppy ears near its head, and a dorsal fin down its back.It can live on land for 37 straight hours because of its ability to breath above water as well as under. Despite its looks, it has become a delicacy on the menus of trendy Californian restaurants, where it costs about $15 (US dollars) per pound - around £11.65. Professor Donovan German, of the University of California at Irvine, described the taste as delicate and mild.The UN has warned rising temperatures, extreme weather and land degradation due to climate change will wipe out crops and livestock but scientists think this fish, official name Cebidichthys violaceus, could be the answer.The study, published in the Royal Society B, found that the monkeyface prickleback opens doors to industrial aquaculture because it is efficient at surviving on vegetarian foods with low levels of a fatty substance called lipids.At the moment a major issue with aquaculture is what to feed the fish being raised, so being able to give them vegetation will save money and be better for the environment.The monkeyface prickleback is among just five per cent of the world\u0027s 30,000 fish species that are vegetarians, relying on algae for nourishment.First author of the study Joseph Heras said: Using plant based food ingredients reduces pollution and costs less. However, most aquaculture fish are carnivores and can\u0027t handle plant lipids.Sequencing this genome has provided us a better understanding of what types of genes are necessary for breaking down plant material.If we scan additional fish genomes, we may find omnivorous fish with the right genes that could provide new candidates for sustainable aquaculture. The discovery means that the monkeyface prickleback could be a particularly suitable target for breeding in aquaculture. Increased aquaculture is a possible alternative to aggressive agriculture often blamed for the climate crisis. Agricultural activities, including fertilizer use, farm machinery and livestock waste, lead to a range of pollutant gases, and especially nitrogen compounds.Agriculture caused 88 percent of ammonia and 68 percent of nitrous oxide emissions in the UK in 2016, and cattle causes 49 percent of the annual total UK agricultural emissions.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/12/11/Rishi-Sunak.jpg","title":"budget surplus chancellor rishi sunak uk government","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.January\u0026nbspsurplus comes in at £9.8bn, lower than the consensus forecast of £11.4bnThe UK posted a smaller than expected\u0026nbspbudget\u0026nbspsurplus in January, a month that traditionally sees an inflow of tax revenues, according to figures that highlighted the challenge facing incoming chancellor Rishi Sunak.The surplus, excluding public sector-owned banks, stood at £9.8bn, down by £2.1bn\u0026nbspor 18 per cent\u0026nbspfrom January 2019, the Office for National Statistics\u0026nbspsaid. The consensus forecast was for an £11.4bn surplus.This meant that borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, covering April 2019 to January 2020, was £44.8bn –\u0026nbsp£5.8bn or 14.9 per cent more than in the same period the previous year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIf the trend continues over February and March, the full-year deficit will be around £45bn, according to analysts at Investec Bank. This would still be below the £47.6bn that the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast.An improvement in revenue thanks to a record £16.2bn collected through self-assessment was cancelled out by a 3.6 per cent annual increase in spending –\u0026nbspday-to-day rather than investment expenditure, reflecting increases in spending on health, social care and education pledged by former prime minister Theresa May.Budget to go ahead in March, new chancellor confirmsSpending by government departments rose by 6.5 per cent compared with a year earlier. Total spending, including capital investment, rose by 5.5 per cent. The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They’re the ones who have the deepest sense of who they are, and what they value, and what they care about.”Mr Buttigieg then paid tribute to his husband Chasten, who was sat in the\u0026nbspfront row of the audience.Buttigieg mocks Trump for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels“And one of those people by the way, one of the strongest people I know, is my husband, Brad Pitt.”During his interview with Ms DeGeneres, Mr Buttigieg also questioned\u0026nbspto what extent Mr Trump meets the traditional definition of masculinity: “You know, when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan, Donald Trump was working on season seven\u0026nbspof Celebrity Apprentice.”As the Democratic presidental primary continues, Mr Buttigieg is still riding high from his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, but has yet to rise towards the top of the national polls, in which Bernie Sanders still leads the other candidates by a significant margin.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, in recent years, rents have skyrocketed in the city of more than 3.7 million inhabitants, pushing middle class families from Berlin’s central residential neighbourhoods like Mitte or Prenzlauer Berg to the outskirts. Even traditionally working class and immigrant neighbourhoods like Neukoelln or Kreuzberg have become so gentrified that long-time tenants can no longer afford the rising rents.Idyllic Italian town offers to pay new residents’ rentIn addition there is an overall housing shortage in Berlin, which makes it even more difficult for newcomers or those who get pushed out of their homes due to the rent spike to find new, affordable living accommodations.The rent freeze is supposed to keep rents for apartments that were built before 2014 at the current level for the next five years. Critics have pointed out that the rent freeze will keep landlords from investing any money into much-needed renovations of homes, because they cannot raise the rent afterward.Tenants, who think their rent isover-priced, have been encouraged by pro-tenant organizations to ask their landlords for a reduction in rent. However, the controversial law has been taken to court by its opponents and some experts have warned tenants to keep all the extra money that they may now be saving on the side, in case the rent freeze is eventually overturned in court.The rent freeze, which was implemented by Berlin’s left-leaning coalition government, has been strongly criticised by Chancellor Angela Merkel‘s more conservative Christian Democrats, who are in the opposition in Berlin’s city-state government.In a statement on Sunday, the Berlin faction of the Christian Democrats wrote that, “the law is not a solution for the continuing housing shortage... The freeze does not help anybody if, in the end, saved rent has to possibly be paid back.” Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several of their leaders have talked about bringing impeachment proceedings against ministers and even the country’s president Hassan Rouhani.A previous attempt to initiate impeachment proceedings against Mr Rouhani failed to get off the ground in the reformist dominated parliament, but the numbers have now changed drastically.At the very least there are likely to be attempts to curb the power of the president and his\u0026nbspforeign minister\u0026nbspMohammad Javad Zarif, two key figures instrumental\u0026nbspin driving through an agreement with international powers on the country’s nuclear programme.The hardliners had vehemently opposed that deal, holding that it compromised the state’s security and insisting the west would renege on it sooner or later. They have also accused the president and senior ministers of turning a blind eye to corruption.The outcome of any impeachment move would ultimately depend on the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the\u0026nbsp Council,\u0026nbspthe powerful election supervisory body.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The turnout was more than 62 per cent each time.People had then flocked to vote in a wave of optimism after the nuclear deal with the anticipation of political and\u0026nbspsocial changes, the economy transforming and excitement at\u0026nbspIran reopening to the outside world.But Donald Trump’s drive to dismantle the agreement, pulling the US out of it and then imposing punitive sanctions, has left the economy struggling. There has also been mounting anger at political corruption, inefficiency and the failure to deliver on many of the promises made by the government.Ayatollah Khamenei\u0026nbspand Mr Rouhani had repeatedly exhorted the electorate to vote, declaring that a failure to do so would be used by the US and its allies as a sign of popular discontent against the state.The supreme leader claimed that “enemy propaganda”\u0026nbspin the form of publicising\u0026nbspthe spread of coronavirus in the country has been used to dissuade people from voting.But interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli pointed to the rising toll from the virus, with six dead so far, as one of the main factors in people staying away from the polling stations. He also maintained “we believe that the number of votes and the turnout is absolutely acceptable”.There were signs of regret among some of those who had opted not to vote. Farah Mazandaranihad voted for reformists in the previous parliamentary election and for Mr Rouhani for president.The 23-year-old student had abstained from voting this time out of dismay at the government’s performance and also in protest at the decision by the  Council to reject a total of 6,850 candidates out of 14,000.“A lot of my friends and I decided not to vote, this was not ignoring politics but taking our own form of political action”, she wanted to explain. “We are now worried that they may use it to try control things like women’s rights even more. Perhaps we will think again at the presidential election”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Godfather 2 is the exception, not the rule. With their small budgets, bad actors, terrible scripts, sequels are often a disappointment. The issue is that they are so often the product of money-grabbing film execs, less concerned about making a good movie than trading off the success of the original.\u0026nbspWe would all be better off if studios focussed on making something new rather than trying to insert life back into what’s gone before. Let the detective stay dead, leave the couple at the wedding altar, let that airborne virus remain in remittance. Ignore the investor whispering in your ear: the monstrously big shark does not need to eat more tourist’s legs off.\u0026nbspPeople never learn. A sequel to romantic classic PS I Love You is currently in development. No, you won’t have to watch Hillary Swank lose her husband twice, nor does he come back from the dead. But you will have to endure more tragedy PS I Love You’s sequel will see Holly helping the terminally ill write to their loved ones.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPS No One Loves a Sequel. To prove it here is the most unnecessary examples on record.Click through the gallery below to see the list.Created with Sketch.The 27 worst film sequels of all time Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once.

But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat. Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is cheaper to buy, but contains moisture and when burned gives off more smoke and pollution than dry wood.It is also harder to set alight, and dficult to burn.Burning wet wood can also lead to a build-up of soot and sticky creosote inside of the burner.Dry wood has usually been dried out in a kiln and has a moisture content of % or less.If you are chopping your own wood to burn, it will need to be dried out for around a year in order to be classied as dry. Some types of wood, such as oak, will require longer.Pieces of wet wood will make a dull thud when knocked together, while you can spot dry wood by looking for cracks, a dull colour and loose bark. The logs will also feel lighter.Dry wood is not only better for the environment, but burning it gives off more heat - making it more efficient, while your stove will require less cleaning and maintenance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course public safety must trump the wellbeing of jihadis.And it’s what Brits want: the Conservatives were elected on a manesto to restore law and order to this country.Unfortunately, peers don’t have to worry about constituents. However they vote and whatever they say, we can never remove them. Which is why they can block necessary and popular legislation when it takes their fancy.Well, we’ve got news for them. The House of Lords limps on because abolishing it is not at the forefront of the public’s mind. Butpeers allow ANOTHER convicted terrorist to maim and kill on our streets, it sure will be.And then the whole sorry institution will be living on borrowed time.BULLYING and banning things is no way to turn this country green.Hiking fuel tax will make the lives of ordinary people harder. As will banning petrol cars for electric ones when there’s no adequate nationwide charging system. Phasing out wood-burning stoves is another sop to the nanny state.And because Brits are eco-conscious already, none of these moves is remotely necessary. Over a third of us have installed a smart meter to monitor energy usage, and four-fths are making an effort to save energy at home.The Government is welcome to give us tempting incentives to stay green.But bossy bans and taxes must end now.IF EU officials believe our Government will cave in to their ludicrous demands, they have another thing coming.When timid Theresa May was leading a minority Government, the EU could strongarm Britain into anything.But now the Leave campaign has been transplanted to No with a whopping mandate, the scales of power have tipped. If the EU can grasp this fact, these trade talks might prove fruitful.If not, Britain will walk out. And European politicians will be the ones to face the music at the ballot box.THREE cheers for our new blue passports. They are a welcome restoration of a powerful symbol of sovereignty.Most Brits consider themselves British, not European, citizens.So EU-issued burgundy passports always rubbed us up the wrong way.At last, a real sign that Britain is OUT.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is already clear the UK and the EU are MILES APART on how any deal would work — and moving further away from each other.Brussels insists this country signs up to stringent rules on a “level playing field” and governance before the talks can proceed. This means they want the UK to agree to stick to a bunch of EU rules even after we have left.At the same time, they want a structure where the EU’s own institutions have a key role in decidingthe UK is doing this or not.The EU view is that the UK will ultimately agree to these demands because the EU is so much bigger.One figure on the European side dismisses the idea that the UK and the EU are “sovereign equals”, pointing out that the EU has a population of million to our million.They think economic reality and the threat of long queues of lorries at Dover will lead to the UK backing down.But the Government is not going to do that. It thinks agreeing to these restrictions would destroy the whole point of Brexit: Our ability to do things dferently.Boris Johnson has been praising chief negotiator David Frost’s speech making this point as “magnicent” to anyone who’ll listen.If the EU insists on these preconditions in the opening round of negotiations, scheduled for the first week of March, the Government will dismiss the talks as pointless.Inside No, they believe Brussels does not realise how much has changed since the General Election.One source tells me: “The EU, understandably, are treating this negotiation like the previous one. But our hand is much stronger because of the mandate we’ve been given by voters.”Downing Street hopes Frost’s speech this week will make the European side realise we are serious about not accepting EU preconditions.One insider points out that Boris Johnson needn’t have an election until  — so nearly every European leader would pay the price at the ballot box before he does for any economic disruption caused by the failure of negotiations.When I asked one Secretary of State why the Government was so adamant that everything had to be settled by the end of this year, I was told: “If there are hiccups, it is better for them to happen in Year One of a government, not Year Three.”It is not just on the future relationship that the UK and EU are heading for a row.A figure close to the negotiations says they are “starting to wake up in Brussels to the fact we have a totally dferent interpretation of the Irish protocol”, which covers arrangements for the Irish border.The appointments of Suella Braverman as Attorney-General and Brandon Lewis as Northern Ireland Secretary indicates the Government is preparing to take a robust approach.This will infuriate the EU side, which believes these arrangements have already been agreed.Interestingly, influential figures on both sides hope the blow-up in trade talks comes SOONER rather than later.Why  Because they think it is only once the two sides have realised just how far apart they really are that the serious negotiations can begin.DOWNING Street is acutely aware that one of the biggest dangers to this government is LOSING VOTERS’ TRUST.If people come to see this administration as just another bunch of politicians who don’t do what they said they would, then it is doomed.No also knows that Boris Johnson’s opponents love to attack him as “untrustworthy”.This didn’t hurt him too much at the election because voters regard most politicians as untrustworthy.Butthere was a clear and compelling example of him breaking his word to voters then that could change, and very quickly.This explains why the promises made in the Tory manesto are being treated as holy writ in government.There is a serious point to Boris’s cringe-making call and response with Cabinet ministers about how they are going to hire , more police officers.He knows they need to do this to show a sceptical electorate that he keeps his promises.During the campaign, he admitted that the questions about whether he keeps his word made his “blood boil”.The whole emphasis on promise-keeping is bad news for Heathrow and the third runway.In , Boris promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop it being built. Sothe bulldozers move in on his watch it will be acutely embarrassing.You can just imagine the split screen of his comments and the ground being flattened – it would dramatise the whole trust issue.This is one of the reasons why I think the third runway won’t end up happening.If in the next few weeks the Mayor of London wins his judicial review against the decision to go ahead with it, I doubt the Government will appeal the verdict.But Patel is not the first Home Secretary to have dficult relations with him.Allies of Amber Rudd believed that Rutnam should have gone when she quit over the handling of the Windrush scandal, which was as much an institutional failure as a political one.Friends of hers believe one of the reasons why the review into it has yet to be published is that it makes clear that the institutional Home Office is to blame for what went wrong.The ministers keep changing but the Home Office has not been “fit for purpose” for some time.It is proof that effective government is going to require reform of Whitehall.I understand Trump spontaneously raises the issue with social confidants, as well as figures inside his administration. He complains about the “betrayal” it represents.It isn’t just Trump who is cross. A host of Tory MPs are still pushing No to give an indication as to when the  per cent cap on Huawei involvement in the G network will be reduced to zero.The question is whether Boris will have done anything to address these concerns before he heads to the US for the G summit and a meeting with Trump in JuneThe contest hasn’t captured the public’s imagination and it has mostly served as a reminder of how in hock Labour still is to Corbynite ideology.None of the three remaining candidates is proposing the kind of break from the Corbyn years that is needed.Until it can break these shackles, Labour won’t be a national party again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stamp duty tops everyone’s calls for reform.George Osborne’s loathed property tax hike paralysed the housing market, locked up billions in hoarded capital, destroyed job mobility — and reduced Treasury revenues.Cutting stamp duty would instantly free up spending and boost the whole economy — especially for tradesmen and the hard-hit High Street.Speaking of shops, business rates need drastic reform to save our shuttered town centres. Why not tax the property owners instead of their struggling tenant shop-keepers All these measures would boost productivity — the amount we earn as a country for every hour worked.Ours is woeful. The average French worker produces more in four days than we do in a full week.Firms have learned to rely on cheap foreign labour, subsidised by taxpayers with welfare top-ups.Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration shake-up will cut the flow of cheap labour and force firms to pay proper wages for low-paid care home and service industry workers.The Chancellor can also help by reforming the Factory Tax and encouraging firms to invest in new machinery and technology — the key to economic growth.Whatever Sunak does on March , his duty is to make sure Britain is braced and ready for Brexit.Whatever he does will upset the critics. Sir Geoffrey Howe’s revolutionary  Budget was denounced by  “top” economists in The Times.In , the SNP’s Alex Salmond was booted out of the Commons for heckling Nigel Lawson’s tax-slashing measures.Together those controversial budgets cured Britain as the Sick Man Of Europe and began  years of unbroken economic growth.We need Rishi Sunak to walk in their giant footsteps and turn Britain into the offshore economic dynamo so feared by our erstwhile European partners.It has bluffed its way through the past few decadesby posturing as an integrated political and economic colossus.In reality, like the Wizard Of Oz, it has concealed its naked corruption, barefaced greed and brazen incompetence behind a curtain of bluster and denial.Britain was always there to impose reality on this world of self-delusion.

In a move described as ­“extraordinary” and “petulant”, the couple published complaints on their Sussex Royal website, which will have to be redesigned within weeks. They questioned the power of the Queen and the Government, saying there is no legal case to stop them trading on the royal name abroad. The statement read: “While there isn’t any jurisdiction by The Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word ‘Royal’ overseas, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use ‘Sussex Royal’ or any iteration of the word ‘Royal’ in any territorywhen the transition occurs in Spring .” The couple suggested they were being treated unfairly after the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William agreed to allow them to leave The Firm. As big banks and corporations queue up to work with them, they have been told to prove they can make it work while not profiting off the royal brand. In what is also being seen as a “highly inflammatory” move, Harry and Meghan ­insisted they will ­continue to receive taxpayer-funded security despite no deal being reached between the UK and Canada, where they are currently living with son Archie.  The statement read: “While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the ­institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month ­review period has been put in place.” A royal source said: “It’s pretty clear they are referencing minor royals such as Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, which is an odd association to make for two people whose associates were once claiming they had single-­handedly modernised the monarchy.” On security, they suggested they would demand round-the-clock protection paid for by the public, owing to, “The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military ­service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat”.  A royal source said: “We’re witnessing a quite extraordinary turn of events. “The British people will not stand for two ­multi-millionaires demanding taxpayer funds after abandoning the country they should be serving. “The latest series of comments published on the Sussexes’ website comes across as ­extremely petulant and has caused a great deal of alarm inside the palace. “This is further evidence of Harry and Meghan further ostracising ­themselves from the family rather than building bridges.”  Harry and Meghan defied the Queen on January  by releasing a statement on Instagram announcing they were to “step back” as senior members of the royal family. They intended to move to North America and trade on their royal ­connections to make money in the corporate world, while setting up a charitable vehicle and ­carrying out small roles for the Queen – but they were told there could be no “halfway house”. The couple have spent thousands trademarking Sussex Royal items and marketing their website and Instagram page.

A company with a similar name to fashion stylist Jessica Mulroneyaposs charity registered a website known as apossussexglobalcharitiesapos last Wednesday, causing confusion. The Shoebox Project Foundation, a company registered in the US state of North Carolina registered the site. After reports claimed Mulroney had used her charity to claim the domain name, she tweeted a denial, writing it had no affiliations or ties to our charity The Shoebox Project. It comes after Harry and Meghan were told that they would no longer be able to use their Sussex Royal brand. Earlier this year, Andrew Myer, Meghanaposs US business manager, told the Mail on Sunday that he had registered two websites - archefoundation and archefoundation.org - just eight days after the Duchess revealed she was pregnant in October, . In September last year, he renewed the trademark of Meghanaposs now-defunct lestyle blog, The Tig. Meanwhile, their lives as working royals will end on March  when they stop representing the Queen and become financially independent. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex hit back in a long statement in which they argued that neither the Queen nor the government owned the word aposroyalapos across the world. Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said the declaration reflected how unhappy the couple were, according to Sun Online. The statementaposs underlying message is they are very, very unhappy with this arrrangment., he said. It was completely unnecessary.  If they are unhappy with this arrangement, one would hope it lasts the year until the review and hope that both sides are able to continue to co-exist in a reasonable and peaceful way. The Palace confirmed Meghan and Harry will be closing their Buckingham Palace office, meaning their  employees face the axe as the couple prepare to move their lives to North America. Harry will keep his military ranks of Major, Lieutenant Commander, and Squadron Leader but will not use them during the  month trial period. New details of when we will see the couple, who are currently in Canada with their son Archie, next have also emerged. Harry will join Jon Bon Jovi as he re-records his song ‘Unbroken’ with the Invictus Games Choir on February . On March  Meghan will join Harry to attend the Endeavour Fund Awards.

Aid worker Ziz York paid to have her two girls Nia, nine, and eight-year-old Robyn join her on a visit so they could witness real poverty. She said: “Before we went to Uganda, my daughters had been complaining ‘Oh, we’re so poor’ because they’d seen friends get holidays to Disney World or getting an Xbox for their birthdays. “I said ‘You have a roof over your head, we can buy pretty much what we want in a supermarket, you have freedom of movement, we are in the top % richest in the world’.” The girls were not convinced, pointing out they don’t have “a mansion or servants”. So their mum showed them the conditions faced by some in the East Africa nation. She said: “We do live in a suburban bubble, so Uganda was mind-blowing for them. “I think the biggest eye-opener for them was the lack of clothing.  “They were seeing children that were a quarter dressed because their clothes were that ragged. “They saw the lack of basic supplies we take for granted. “The Ugandan kids didn’t have pens, paper, underwear – a lot didn’t have shoes. There were no toys.”  Nia and Robyn did not witness the malnutrition suffered by some children in the country, or those dying from malaria, but Ziz said they saw enough to understand why Uganda needs help. She added: “I wish more British people could get that perspective.” The mum, from Inverness, works for British charity TeamsU which specialises in educating people in Uganda about sexual health.  It aims to teach girls about their periods so they are not too ashamed to go to school. Periods are seen by many there as a “curse”. One in four women have a child by the age of . The charity also gives family planning lessons. Health workers offering birth control have been met by men with machetes.

Former Franklin College student Lucy Dawsonaposs parents were told sheaposd have to be sectioned after she started shouting her housemateaposs name, trembling and giggling manically. She experienced terrying panic attacks and at one stage her friend saw her rocking back and forth while hunched in a ball.The -year-old also tried to throw herself out of a moving car leading doctors to believe she was mentally unstable, Grimsby Live reports. Her shocked parents even asked friendsshe was taking drugs orher drinks had been spiked after one attack. But three months after being committed to a psychiatric ward, Lucy was diagnosed with Anti-NMDA Receptor Autoimmune Encephalitis, a rare brain disorder. It is a serious condition in which the brain becomes inflamed. Encephalitis can be le threatening and anyone can be affected but the very young and very old are most at risk. Lucy previously laid bare her ordeal but has now spoken out again to raise awareness of her condition as this weekend marks World Encephalitis Day, celebrated annually on February . In October , Lucy became overrun by negativity, locking herself away in her bedroom and avoiding all social interactions.She began to question her capabilities – saying she was going to fail her degree and started experiencing excruciating headaches.But, unfortunately, this was only the start of Lucyaposs troubles.  She was soon experiencing confusion, loss of consciences, problems speaking and weakness. Lucy, from Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, said: My housemate and best friend, Becs, found me in the early hours of the morning shouting her name with wild eyes and trembling in my room. Becs managed to contact my mum, who advised her to call an ambulance. My mum tried to speak to me on the phone but I couldnapost speak other than repeat the same word or giggle manically. Doctors said Lucy had suffered a panic attack and sent her home  minutes later with breathing exercises. But Lucy said: The next morning everything erupted.  Becs found me again at am frantically screaming her name. I was sat bunched in a ball in the middle of my room rocking backwards and forwards. Lucyaposs parents travelled to the University of Leicester to support their daughter through another hospital visit. They asked her housemates whether she had taken any drugs or had been spiked – she had not. On her way to hospital, Lucy tried to escape a moving car, and had to be physically restrained in the waiting room.  Later on that day, doctors told Lucyaposs parents she had suffered a severe mental breakdown and needed to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act . She was admitted to a mental health unit where she began to receive treatment. I was pumped religiously with psychotic drugs for a fictional mental breakdown, said Lucy. Because of this, my brain disease was able to progress, meaning my body effectively began to shut down and die. Doctors told my mum and dad I was going to die and they didnapost know why. After a hazy three months in a psychiatric ward, the condition Anti-NMDA Receptor Autoimmune Encephalitis was raised. Lucyaposs parents were told they could sign papers for her to undergo electroshock therapy in a last-ditch attempt to save their daughter’s le. She went on to receive three rounds of electroshock therapy and her first treatment coincided with her st birthday. Lucy said: By no means is this a treatment for encephalitis and by no means should it have worked. However, by some miracle, by the third round of shocks, I began to have large seizures which somehow must have shook my brain into resetting. Lucy was placed back into her hospital in a catatonic state, meaning she couldnapost feel her body.  She said: I was left unattended on this bed. It was at this moment that I had my next seizure. I was convulsing so much I fell off the bed and onto an open radiator pipe that was directly next to it. Lucy suffered a cm third-degree burn on her left buttock. She said: I was extremely hazy for a long time after first coming around.  I vaguely remember realising my left leg and foot were not working when I tried to get out of bed. Doctors said her leless leg was a result of encephalitis and her body wasn’t fully done waking up. On top of this, Lucy was unable to speak and all her memories had vanished. She credits her grandparents for playing a remarkable role in her rehabilitation. She said: My favourite singer had always been Elvis Presley and my grandpa bought every single one of his song books and learnt to play all his songs on the keyboard in the hope I would remember them and sing along. It wasn’t until a chance appointment with a locum doctor that Lucy finally received answers about her leg. She told the doctor what had happened and said she could almost see the penny drop. Lucy said: She said my burn was directly in the same place as my sciatic nerve. She believed the burn had been so severe it had burnt through my nerve completely and killed it, thus leaving my left leg paralysed from the knee down.  Lucy said suddenly, everything started to make sense and she was able to slowly start piecing her le back together. She had put her criminology degree on hold while undergoing treatment and rehabilitation.Lucy said: I can remember watching the Facebook live video of all my coursemates walking onto the stage and collecting their graduation certicates.As tears streamed down my face, I wonderedI would ever be able to string a sentence together again, let alone write a dissertation worthy of a degree. During a tearful conversation with her sister about her future, it was suggested she focus on her passion for writing instead of worrying about her degree.Her sister, a graphic designer, set up the blog  Lucy in the Sky with Encephalitis and created a zebra logo.Lucy said: The zebra is used in teaching medical students, where they are told: aposIf you hear hoof beats, think horse, not zebraapos. This means go down the diagnosis route that seems the most obvious and don’t expect it to be a rare disease. In my case, the doctors heard hoof beats and thought mental breakdown when in fact, I was the zebra – with encephalitis.

Unfortunately, these dreams donapost always become a reality whether thataposs because people changed their mind as they grew up, the opportunity didnapost present itself, or le simply got in the way and bills needed to be paid. But, having passion for your job can be le changing, and it is never too late to try and achieve your childhood hopes and dreams. Andyou are yet to reach your career goals or have found yourself going down a dferent path to the one you really want, retraining in your spare time can help you get back on track and into that job you always dreamed of. The study also revealed some of the top careers todayaposs adults wanted when they were children, including teaching, nursing or becoming a vet. Others had dreams of working for the police, being a musician or actor, or even being a ballerina. And  per cent were convinced their future lay in being a professional footballer. Despite dreams of being a professional athlete, zookeeper or train driver, six in  adults considered their childhood job goals to be perfectly realistic. And for those who made it a reality, a third admitted they had to work in more than one field before they were successful. Some of the main reasons for having to make dferent choices to the ones they really wanted when they were younger include failing to get good enough grades , and simply not knowing where to start . However, just under a tenth believe their parents dissuaded them from following their dream career path. It also emerged  per cent of respondents regret not chasing their dream job, and a fth have attempted to re-train or completed further education to get them on the right track.  One in three also say theyaposd be happy to take a pay cut,it enabled them to work in their dream career, according to the OnePoll research. Rebecca Jane, , from Clitheroe, wanted to work in the mental health field after facing depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress since she was a young adult. Now, she is the head of a mental health charity and responsible for coming up with schemes and ideas to help those in need. She said: Iaposve had struggles with mental health for  years now. Iaposve been that person who hasnapost had anywhere to turn and hasnapost been able to access what Iaposve needed to access at the worst point in my le. Itaposs amazing to see it benefiting other people, but itaposs also amazing that I can actually see it helping. As cheesy as it sounds, it literally completes my le. I had to sell my investigation company because it was too much stress for me. I went on a journey to find myself and to actually do this dream of helping people and thankfully it all worked out and itaposs exactly what I do.

He was a flamboyant character and was the le and soul of the party, but he was also sensitive and didnapost always understand social situations.\u2028 He was very articulate and was much more comfortable socialising with adults than people his own age and I think this made him a target.\u2028 But he was a beautul person and he had a very good group of close friends.\u2028 Ms Steward said Simonaposs bullying started at primary school when other children would name call or steal his bag - but progressed to physical violence when he started secondary school.\u2028 It was relentless, she said. He couldnapost get away from it. On the day he took his own le, heaposd had a fall out. It was over something trivial, but I think it had built up inside and this was what tipped him over the edge.\u2028 Just before Simon died we had agreed to home school. He loved subjects such as design and technology and he was very inquisitive, he loved learning.\u2028 But it got to the point where he just didnapost want to go to school anymore.\u2028  Ms Steward said that while Simon was a happy teenager who was full of le, the bullying started to take its toll on his home le.\u2028 She said: He would come home from school and for the first hour or so he wasnapost himself. But then he would relax for a bit and would be back to normal.\u2028 But then by nighttime he would be tense again. He wouldnapost sleep at night. By the end, he was sleeping in my bed and his father would sleep in his.\u2028 It was the same at the weekends. On Friday evenings he would have a sudden burst of energy, it was like a switch had gone off, but then by Sunday evening he would be saying he didnapost want to go to school.\u2028 But despite all that he loved le completely. He was always the first person to volunteer to speak in front of a crowd and he was a daredevil. He loved bungee jumps and skyes and he was a real thrill seeker.\u2028 I just think that at the moment in time he didnapost know what  to do.\u2028 In the afternoon of March , , Simon skipped his last lesson of the day and made his way home early. He then took a cocktail of medication.\u2028  A suicide note written by Simon was later discovered in the house.\u2028 Ms Steward first learnt about Simonaposs overdose when she ed home hours later to find the emergency services outside.\u2028 She said: I was out with friends and I just had this sudden feeling that something bad had happened. I think Simon and I had this special connection and I just told my friends that I had to go home.\u2028 When we arrived at the house there was an ambulance outside. I ran inside and Simon was sat at the dining room table talking to paramedics.\u2028 It turned out that a friend had messaged him to ask why he hadnapost been in school and he told her what he had done.\u2028 He sent a message saying that he aposhad done itapos and that he wanted to be with God. She told her mum, who managed to find out where we lived and called the police.\u2028  When I arrived home, nobody thought it was serious. Simon was telling the paramedics about the bullying at school, saying that he had had enough - but there was no sense of urgency. We had to wait an hour for an ambulance to arrive. \u2028Nobody thought it was a big deal because he was conscious and was cooperating with the emergency services. Looking back, I wish I had dragged him into the bathroom and made him vomit.\u2028 Simon was taken to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital by ambulance at around pm on March . He was subsequently transferred to Cardfaposs University Hospital of Wales on March , where he was admitted to the intensive care unit.\u2028  Ms Steward said that Simon was lying in his hospital bed when he told her that he didnapost want to die. \u2028He didnapost want to kill himself, she said. He was telling me that he was sorry and that he wished he hadnapost done it and that heaposd been stupid.\u2028 But at this point, I still thought it was going to be ok. I thought we would get through it and that I would take him home.\u2028 It wasnapost until we were in the Heath hospital that I realised just how serious it was. A nurse came into the room and was concerned that his haemoglobin levels were so low and then it all happened at once. Suddenly the room was full of nurses and doctors.\u2028 It felt like there was an elephant in the room, and I asked them to tell me what was going on. They said they were going to transfer him to the ICU.\u2028 I remember he was so scared and confused about why all these people were by his bed. After they transferred him to the ICU, they put him into an induced coma.\u2028 Simon died two days later.\u2028  Ms Steward said: They told us that it was serious and that we should make plans to say goodbye. I phoned my other two children and Simonaposs father and said look, aposI think you need to come downapos.\u2028 I still feel the pain I felt that day. Itaposs been nearly six years, but it feels like it happened yesterday.\u2028 I feel like part of me has been ripped away. Simon and I were incredibly close, we had a bond that I canapost describe and I will always feel the loss and the pain that comes with losing him.\u2028 An inquest into Simonaposs death concluded that medical cause of death was multiple organ dys caused by an overdose of several drugs.\u2028 Ms Steward said Simonaposs death had understandably taken its toll on her own mental health.\u2028 For the first  months, I was like a zombie - but I was getting by, she said. I ended up having a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\u2028 But I need to make sure that Simonaposs death was not in vain and that bullying is taken seriously. I think people have this idea that bullying is almost normal in schools, but imaginethat happened in the workplace.\u2028 Adults have laws in place to protect them, children donapost.\u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"vulnerable womans belongings found near","story":"NewsYoung womans belongings found near river after going missing after leaving nightclubItems belonging to Emily Hope have been found next to the River Clyde the day after the -year-old was last seen leaving Mango nightclub and heading towards Tradeston Bridge in GlasgowShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsEmily Hopes belongings were found by the River Clyde \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs statement detailing the royal agreement on le away from the monarchy aposindicates the pair are very unhappy with the dealapos, experts claim. The couple published a y post on their Sussex Royal website outlining the deal they struck with the Queen but experts say the pair are bitter about restrictions being placed on them. Richard Fitzwilliams, royal expert and commentator, said even the act of publishing the longer statement on their website was a telltale sign of their hostility. He said: It is completely unnecessary to add that. Simply because it underlines their dferences with the palace in a way that is avoidable. Here we take a look at what the main paragraphs - from not using aposSussex Royalapos to keeping their patronages - really mean. Seeking work where What the statement says: While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month review period has been put in place. Per the agreement The Duke and Duchess of Sussex understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties and not undertake representative duties on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen. In the announcement, the Sussexes told of a -month review period on Megxit but in the sour message the pair highlight such a measure hasnapost been placed upon for other royals. Mr Fitzwilliams said the statement could suggest the couple believe they are being treated dferently to other royals, such as Princess Beatrice and Queen Elizabeth IIaposs eldest grandson Peter Phillips, who are both permitted to earn their own money - with no review of their circumstances. He told The Sun online: It isn’t clear why, because Harry’s military appointments are being kept open and it only makes sense to see how this arrangement works after a year. Their behaviour is completely unprecedented.  Sussex Royal What the statement says: While there is not any jurisdiction by The Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word aposRoyalapos overseas, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use aposSussex Royalapos or any iteration of the word aposRoyalapos in any territorywhen the transition occurs Spring . Other royal commentators have blasted the couple for their spiteful statement after the Queen prevented them from using the word royal for their branding after they step back from duties. According to Mr Fitzgerald, the contradicting comment makes it clear they donapost like the deal. He said: The idea of putting out a statement which agrees that they canapost use the word royal but contradicts the idea the monarchy can stop them using it,apos he said, apostheyaposre basically saying the royals canapost stop them using it, but they wonapost be using itapos. It has been especially unnecessary to underline it in this way, especially as the agreement will be reviewed after a year.  It simply empathises the ision that we know thataposs there. The tone theyaposve taken is that they are unhappy, theyaposve made it clear every step of the way. News of the ban on the use of royal was a blow for the Duke and Duchess who have already spent thousands of pounds on trademark branding. The Queen drafted in top lawyers to enforce the rule on the pair. In light of the restriction, applications to use the trademark on merchandise such as clothes, books and stationary were cancelled. Meghan complained to her close friends about the Sussex Royal name ban, saying shouldnapost even be an issue in the first place and itaposs not like they want to be in the business of selling T-shirts and pencils. They added: Meghan said sheaposs done with the drama and has no room in her le for naysayers, and the same goes for Harry.  Royal duties What the statement says: It was agreed that The Duke and Duchess will no longer be able to formally carry out ‘official duties’ for The Queen or represent The Commonwealth, but they will, however, be allowed to maintain their patronages . While the couple wonapost represent the Queen on official duties anymore, the word aposallowedapos hints that the monarch has given her permission for them to retain their patronages. The couple have been given many high-profile patronages from the Queen since their wedding in , with Meghan being made Royal Patron of the National Theatre at the start of last year. However, Nica Burns - who co-owns The Nimax Group, which comprises six London West End theatres - says the former Suits actress has until Easter to prove she can still do the job. She said: I think we should give Meghan until Easter to say what she thinks is possible with her patronage.apos We have to give her a chance, forget who she is and give her some space. If she is not going to be doing any work with the National, then she should step down. But as she is a role model, we would rather she didnapost. Security What the statement says: It is agreed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son.  This is based on The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat and risk level documented specically over the last few years. No further details can be shared as this is classied information for safety reasons. Scotland Yard will continue to provide protection to the couple but itaposs not yet known who will pick up the bill. The annual bill is estimated to cost anywhere between £m and £m - and polls have consistently shown the British public arenapost keen to pick up the tab.  Becoming financially independent What the statement says: The Royal Family respect and understand the wish of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to live a more independent le as a family, by removing the supposed ‘public interest’ justication for media intrusion into their lives. They remain a valued part of Her Majesty’s family. In another section of the statement, the couple hammer-home their wish to choose what they do and donapost do. In becoming financially independent, withdrawing from the public eye and splitting time in Canada, the couple hope to escape some of the media scrutiny. The Duke and Duchess will no longer be part of the Royal Rota system that provides UK and broadcast media with exclusive titles and access to official engagements of members of the Royal Family.Mr Fitzgerald said their emphasis on this follows the birth of their son Archie which intensied the coupleaposs desire for privacy. Meghan has also fallen victim to negative press coverage, prompting Prince Harry to compare the pressapos treatment of his we to that of his mother."},{"url":null,"title":"woman told cover up sauna","story":"NewsWoman told to cover up in sauna as mums complained her swimsuit was too sexyA woman claims staff at a leisure centre in Uxbridge asked her to cover herself up after several parents said her swimming costume was \"inappropriate\"ShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsNicole says staff told her to cover up with a towel \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

They are ­genetically changed to grow quickly and suffer a string of health ­problems. One campaigner said: “Such conditions are cruel.” But Tory George Eustice has not ruled out chlorine-washed meat being sold here post-Brexit. Crammed into an airless room with barely any space and ­covered in sores, these chickens spend their pitul seven weeks on earth in silent horror. The end finally comes when their throats are slit at a slaughterhouse before they are machine-plucked and washed in chlorine. I hold one at less than eight weeks old in my hand as its heart pounds in its chest and I am told that thanks to engineered genetics to make them grow quicker,it were a human it would weigh st.  Welcome to the poultry capital of the world, where America’s ravenous appetite for controversial reared chickens is set to take flight across the AtlanticDonald Trump gets his way in a UK-US trade deal.For  years, chlorine-washed US chickens have been banned in the EU over fears it masks poor hygiene standards. But post-Brexit, American poultry producers insist we accept their lower welfare conditions as part of any new tie-up. Today, the Mirror reports from inside the highly secretive industry. One farmer, who rears birds for a major US supplier, took us to his shed at Gainesville, Georgia, to see first hand what is known in these parts as “white gold”. Stepping inside, I was hit by the overpowering smell of faeces and ammonia. The stench from the two-inch deep layer of excrement was so overpowering I had to cover my mouth and nose. Anyone would expect a crescendo of noise from what lives inside. There must have been more than , chickens sitting on the floor in front of me – but all were silent. They didn’t move. Or cluck. Other than those around the corn feeders, most appeared like statues, living in almost complete darkness. Allowed to pick one up, most shocking was its bloated stomach. Like all the others, it had lost its feathers, exposing red raw flesh.  The whole underside of almost every chicken appeared like an unbroken bedsore. Because of their abnormally accelerated weight gain some don’t even make it to slaughter, dying of heart attacks and collapsed lungs. Poultry Science Journal has ­calculated thathumans grew at the same rate as these modern chickens, they would weigh  stone by eight weeks. The noxious compound of nitrogen and hydrogen emitted by the birds can also make them go blind. Driving through the hilly ­farmlands on the outskirts of Gainesville there are times where you can see virtually nothing but series of low pitch-roofed sheds, each about  yards long. We arrived hoping to speak to farmers and paymasters about the industry. But very quickly it became apparent all were under a strict omerta that they dare not break or ­livelihoods would be lost and contracts ripped apart.  One farmer, who asked not to be named, told us: “The whole industry is run like a cartel by the big ­companies. Break the rules and you are dead to them. You’re gone. The poultry manufacturers provide everything… the birds, the feed, the antibiotics, the whole nine yards. “All we are now are landlords renting out our sheds for their tenants seven weeks at a time. “One wrong move though and you’re gone. It’s like dealing with the mafia. Their websites may say they care about animal welfare but their chief concern is profit.” Humane Society International’s Dr Sara Shields said: “Consumers are right to be concerned about importing US chickens. They are crowded together in barren, dark sheds. Under industry standards, each bird lives in a space equivalent in size to A paper. “Crowding can result in higher ammonia levels, skin irritation from wet litter, and scabs and scratches on the backs of birds from climbing over one another in such crowded space.”  Geneticists began breeding dferent chickens for faster growth in . A mix of the two most successful created the Arbor Acre bird. At the same age, the new breed had grown to four times as heavy as the ­original one. The farmer who granted us access to his shed defended the way poultry is raised for meat in the US. Because his birds were two days away from being slaughtered their meat would not be infected with viruses, which takes longer to ­incubate. He said: “The chickens have a short le, but they have space to walk around. I think the conditions are fair. “We are here to raise birds. To have thousands walking freely around a farm would make it ­impossible to fulfil what the markets needs. This is the next best thing.” The Mirror approached several companies to see the ­conditions inside and the chlorine-washing they operate. Three failed to respond.  Fieldale Farms ­president Tom Hensley rejected our request but said of the facilities: “They are spotless. It’s ­[chlorine wash] safe. ­Otherwise,  million Americans would be sick every week.” Britain produces about % of the chicken consumed here. But we also import , tons a year. Ex-International Trade ­Secretary Liam Fox has insisted there is “no health reasons why you couldn’t eat chickens washed in ­chlorine”. But some experts insist the chemical may not kill all bacteria present, such as salmonella. There has been ­criticism about the rise of similar ­mega-farms in Britain. But Cardf politan University senior lecturer in food science Simon Dawson said: “In the US, the hygiene standards are not as rigid as in the EU. Incorporating a ­disinfection spray wash is designed to remove ­pathogenic bacteria. We have worked tirelessly to improve hygiene and welfare ­standards of poultry.” A  study estimated there were about , UK cases of ­salmonella food poisoning a year, or  per , people. One in the US in  found there were just over a million cases annually, about  per ,. Cheap meat is killing workers  It is impossible to rear eight billion chickens a year in the imagined rural farming system most Americans still like to hold in their mind’s eye. Not only do consumers want more meat, more importantly, they want it cheap, and demand is squeezing the industry’s , family farmers. Those feeling the pressure most are process workers – % of whom have no legal right to be in the States. An Oxfam America report in  said supervisors routinely denied employee requests to go to the bathroom. One worker said: “I and many, many others had to wear Pampers.” The local Fieldale factories employ around , people. One plant has a big banner shouting “Think Safe, Work Safe” but in recent years, according to federal safety records, it has been the site of several accidents which have led to amputations and death. One El Salvadoran worker said: “There are hazards everywhere. Typically we are tasked to perform one action over and over again, surrounded by chemicals and rotating blades.” Chlorine and other chemicals used led to the most dramatic examples including a death. Government health inspector Jose Naro died in  from lung damage related to the chemicals used in a processing plant. A government investigation highlighted a rise in the use of toxic, bacteria-killing chemicals. But Agriculture Department inspectors find factories are turning to them more. MPs have beef as Eustice refuses to rule out new laws  Environment Secretary George Eustice refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US in a post-Brexit trade deal yesterday. He said it was illegal to sell such products and there were “no plans” to change the law – but three times he refused to rule it out. “We’re absolutely clear as a Government we will not take risks either without food standards and when it comes to animal welfare we will be projecting our views on the international stage,” he said. He said “lactic acid washes” are used more in the States than chlorine, adding: “We won’t make any moves on our standards.” Lib Dem food spokesman Tim Farron said: “They are wilfully threatening British consumers and farmers.” Labour’s Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said: “Chlorinated chicken being sold in Britain is a genuine risk, unless this backdoor to lower standard US goods imports is closed and a ban is put into law.”QA What is chlorine-washed chicken  American farms are allowed to wash or dip carcasses in water containing chlorine dioxide to kill harmful organisms such as E.coli, salmonella, and campylobacter on the outside of the meat. Why was chlorine-washing banned in the EU in   The EU maintains relying on a chlorine rinse at the end of the meat production process could be a way of compensating for poor hygiene standards – such as dirty rearing sheds or crowded abattoirs. It believes the ban leads to higher standards of hygiene and welfare at each stage.

The northern region of Lombardy has issued a warrant to close schools, interrupt public events and shut businesses apart from the most essential ones, Italian media reported today. It comes as the number of coronavirus cases has risen to more than , making Italy Europeaposs most affected country. Outside China, there have been more than , cases in  countries, the World Health Organisation said, including one confirmed case on the African continent, in Egypt. In China, where the virus originated from, measures to deal with the outbreak have been effective, but the battle is still at a crucial stage, President Xi Jinping said today. China has reported a total of , cases of the disease caused by the virus, known as COVID-, including , deaths. Meanwhile, South Korea declared a red alert on Sunday after a surge in coronavirus infections, now reported as , and a death toll of six. Iran confirmed  new cases of the new coronavirus, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on Sunday, taking the total to  with a death toll of eight. Japanaposs health minister has apologised after a woman who was allowed to leave a coronavirus-infected cruise ship docked near Tokyo tested positive for the virus. Closer to home, a plane carrying  quarantined people from the Diamond Princess arrived back in the UK yesterday morning. The patients, who have already been quarantined for  days on the cruise ship, were then taken by road to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral for  more days of quarantine yesterday.  A third passenger from the coronavirus-infected Diamond Princess in Japan died today, authorities said, as the government promised tointroduce fresh steps to contain the outbreak. More than  people flown out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak left a UK training centre on Sunday for the first time in  days. All  people staying at the Kents Hill Park training and conference centre in Milton Keynes tested negative for the virus.  Meanwhile, Lombardy and Veneto, Italyaposs industrial heartland which jointly account for % of gross domestic output, are the worst hit areas in the country. The last two days of the Venice Carnival, which draws tourists from around the world, were cancelled. The governor of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, said certied cases of the illness in his area had risen to  from  a day earlier. Lombardy is home to Italyaposs financial capital Milan which has a population of . million. The cityaposs mayor Giuseppe Sala announced that all Milan schools will be closed from Monday. Universities in both Lombardy and Veneto have also been shut until early March.  Sporting events have been cancelled in the regions, including three Serie A football matches. Fashion designer Giorgio Armani has said his fashion show scheduled to take place in Milan on Sunday would go ahead in an empty theatre without any press or buyers present. In Codogno, where the first patient identied in the northern cluster is in a critical condition, closed supermarkets, restaurants and shops made the main street practically a ghost town. The few people outside wore face masks, which were coveted items after selling out at pharmacies,reports.  A spokesman for the governor of the northern region Veneto said on Sunday the number of cases there had risen to , seven more than on Saturday. Luca Zaia, the Veneto regional president, said yesterday that the infection showed that the virus is transmitted like any flu and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China were no longer effective containment measures. “You can get it from anyone,” he told reporters. “We can expect to have cases of patients who had no contact [with suspected carriers].”  In an emergency decree approved late on Saturday, the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the extraordinary measures have been put in place to tackle the biggest outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe. The measures were introduced just hours after two people died from the virus in the north of the country. It is believed more than , residents have been asked to stay at home by authorities, Italian news website Fanpage reports.Mr Conte said it would now be forbidden to enter or leave the outbreak areas, unless special permission was granted, according to the BBC. Police, andnecessary the armed forces, will have the authority to ensure the regulations are enforced. The contagiousness of this virus is very strong and pretty virulent, Lombardyaposs health chief Giulio Gallera said.  A -year-old student from Valtellina, a valley in the Lombardy region, tested positive for the virus. His family said they were deeply angry with the healthcare authority which they say surely knew the results of the tests yesterday and they did not inform us. The family said they do not what to do now as the teenager, who studies in Codogno, is now feeling better but still has high temperature, according to La Repubblica.  A -year-old Italian man became the first European person to die after being infected with the coronavirus, health authorities said yesterday. Adriano Trevisan died at a hospital in Padua, northern Italy, after testing positive for positive for COVID-. Mr Trevisan, from the village of Voapos Euganeo near Padua, had recovered some  days earlier from an unrelated health issue, Italyaposs health minister said.

Sinister claims circulating on social media accuse the child and his mum Yarakka Bayles of pulling off a long con. The young Australian boy achieved viral fame practically overnight after a heartbreaking video of him expressing suicidal thoughts broke hearts around the world. Quaden, who lives with a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, is nine years old. In the footage posted online by his mum, the young boy says he is sick of cruel jibes over his appearance and saying he wants to die.    But conspiracy theorists are feeding off online trolls claiming the boy, who has faced bullying all his short le, is actually an adult posing as a child to cash in on his social media stardom and attract public sympathy.After the footage of him crying hysterically went viral, kind strangers have raised thousands to send him and his mum to Disneyland.Quaden has since been showered with support from around the globe, as the public and celebrities rally around him.  But even as Quadenaposs star rises, his mother Yarraka Bayles is being forced to fend off conspiracy theories about her sonaposs age. Fake viral rumours began to emerge almost as soon as his video began getting worldwide attention that Quaden is actually an adult, not a child.  Conspiracy theories have spread thick and fact, despite people who know him defending him - and numerous previous stories about Quaden showing him as a younger child and clearly identying his age being readily available. His mum has hit out on Facebook at the conspiracy theories about her boy. Here are five of the claims about Quaden circulating online: . The claim: aposHe is apos A birthday photo shows Quaden posing at an th birthday party. Conspiracy theorists claim it is his birthday. The reality: The photo was taken at someone aposs birthday partyA photo of Quaden posing with his pals in an Instagram post on January  is captioned aposhappy th ma bah.aposA sign in the picture actually says: aposGarlenaposs th birthdayapos. . The claim: He is actually an adult posing as a childapos Quaden has a high-profile Instagram page and modelling career, which features him regularly donning designer clothing and striking poses. Conspiracy theorists suggest this means he is actually a grown man. The reality: Proof of his age is only a click away Like a growing number of Instagram child stars of his generation Quaden has a wide online following.  One of his sisters is also a model. Striking aposadult-likeapos poses and wearing designer clothing is not out of the ordinary on social media. The boy also lives with achondroplasia, which means Quaden looks dferent from other children his age - which has been the leading case of the bullying he has suffered, and the very reason he now finds himself in the public eye. Quaden has made frequent appearances in Australian media before shooting to worldwide notoriety, because his mum has worked for years to raise awareness about his condition and the bullying he has faced. Footage readily available online shows Quaden at age four in an appearance on Australian television.In the Studio  interview dated , Quaden is sitting on his motheraposs knee and playing with toys, and is clearly a much younger child. He is featured again in an SBS special reportaposLiving Blackapos at age five in , which explores his condition. Not only that, there is also a Today article about Quaden from , that shows him as a five-year-old adopting a rescue dog, in which the young boy is pictured playing with his new pup - with his front baby teeth clearly missing.And according to reliable debunking website Snopes, which targets fake news and viral rumours, Facebook photos that have since been made private show he was a baby in .According to the siteaposs fact-checkers, in , Quadenaposs mum shared a series of pictures that showed her baby son on the beach. In the old post, Yarakka commented on those photographs that her son was almost  months old. . The claim: aposQuaden is a rapper posing as a childaposSeveral accounts have even sprung up around Instagram and Twitter in the days since Quadenaposs video went viral. A Twitter account claiming to be the aposrealapos Quaden under a dferent name emerged.The account posted a series of gloating tweets claiming to be a rapper posing as the boy who had scammed the public for money. Multiple posts accusing the child and his mum of being a scammer are using Facebook posts, pictures and video mash-ups featuring hiphop music, and pictures of Quaden striking poses and explicit language popular in the genre and claiming to provide aposevidenceapos that he is actually a grown man.   The reality: Children like hiphop too At least one account insisting that it is the aposrapperapos Quaden has posted GoFundMe page links in an apparent attempt to profit off the childaposs image. In the age of social media trolling and bots, Internet users must be vigilant to the fact that anyone can set up a fake account on sites like Twitter - and change the pageaposs username and pictures to suit their purpose.The account in question, which theis not naming, was set up in April . It only began posting tweets on February . The only other tweet it had previously posted was a retweet of a Beyonce video.    Most of the images appear to have been taken from his Instagram page, which has since been shut down amid the frenzy.  Before it disappeared, Quadenaposs Instagram account aposQuadosssapos warned his more than , followers that hoaxers were afoot. aposWARNING!!!! FAKE ACCOUNTS! PLEASE REPORT ASAP!apos Quadenaposs account posted to Instagram, along with a screenshot of the Twitter account using his name.  In one viral post doing the rounds, images of Quaden striking poses popular in the hiphop world have been spliced into a montage overlaid with rap music in an effort to suggest he is actually a grown man. Liking hiphop is not exactly unusual among children around the world, and especially in Quadenaposs native Australia.  Overseas doubters may not realise just how popular hiphop is in Australia and New Zealand. Reports and research show the genre is influential both in the rugby league world, and indigenous and Pacic Island cultures aposdown under.apos Quaden is a Murri Aboriginal Queenslander. Only yesterday, the young footy fan led the NRL Indigenous All Stars side out on to the field in front of a cheering crowd of thousands yesterday as they played New Zealandaposs Maori All Stars in the clash. . The claim: aposQuaden Boyles and his mum are scamming the public for cashapos Some posts featuring Quaden holding wads of cash are going viral on social media, overlaid with rap music and cut with images of him posing in designer gear from his Instagram profile. Critics suggest that his viral video was a stunt aimed at cashing in on public sympathy.  The reality: They never asked for money Conspiracy theorists may need to watch Quadenaposs viral video again. Viewers will notice he never asked for money - and neither did his mum. In fact, a crowdfunder set up to send him and his mum to Disneyland was started by American comedian Brad Williams. The crowd fundraiser has raised more than £, for Quaden since the viral video emerged on Thursday. The money raised will be used to send the boy and his mum for a holiday in Disneyland Calornia - and the rest will be given to anti-bullying charities.The Daily Mail Australia reported yesterday that Yarakka was forced to respond to the claims and issue a warning about scam pages trying to cash in on Quadenaposs fame on her Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands lab monkeys infected coronavirus","story":"NewsThousands of lab monkeys infected with coronavirus in bid to find vaccineThe US National Institutes of Health has infected , rhesus macaques with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in a bid to find a vaccine for the strain which has killed close to , humansShareCommentsByAnna SavvaMilo Boyd:,  FEB NewsScientists infected the monkeys with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Rhesus macaques have been infected with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusand then given an experimental antiviral vaccine.More than , of the animals have been infected with the disease by scientists, The Daily Star reported.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that the particular strain has already killed  humans. Symptoms of MERS include fever, cough, and or shortness of breath, with pneumonia, organ failure and septic shock often caused by the disease. Around % of those who contract it die, the World Health Organisation has said. The US National Institutes of Healthfound that the vaccine stopped macaques contracting the disease when used in a preventative manner. Scientists now hopeful they can trial it with the COVID- strain of the disease, which is part of the same family of viruses. Several clinical trials of remdesivir for COVID- are believed to be under way in China, while some humans are thought to have taken the experimental drug in a bid to recover. The macaques study had one group of primates, housed at a lab in Hamilton, Montana, receive the drug  hours before infection with MERS-CoV. Another group were given the vaccine some  hours after infection and another control group did not receive any treatment.  They were then observed for six days, and those treated a day in advance showed no symptoms. The animals which were treated after infection had less damage done to their lungs than the control animals. The scientists argue the results of the study acts as support for further clinical trials of remdesivir for COVID-. That particular strain has so far claimed , lives worldwide, with the figure rising every day. In a statement NIH said: MERS-CoV is closely related to the  novel coronavirusthat has grown to be a global public health emergency since cases were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December.  Remdesivir has previously protected animals against a iety of viruses in lab experiments. The drug has been shown experimentally to effectively treat monkeys infected with Ebola and Nipah viruses. The scientists indicate that the promising study results support additional clinical trials of remdesivir for MERS-CoV and -nCoV. At least two clinical trials of remdesivir for -nCoV are under way in China, and other patients with -nCoV infection have received the drug under a compassionate use protocol. It is thought that MERS originated in camels and was then transmitted to people. Transmission from person to person is believed to be possible.  So far most of the cases are centered in the Middle East, but some have been reported in the US and UK. The UKaposs RSPCA estimates thousands of monkeys, mainly macaques and marmosets, are used in research and testing. RSPCA say: In the UK, around , monkeys are used annually. Much of this use is to develop and test the safety and effectiveness of potential human medicines and vaccines.

after extra time.Ross County visit Pittodrie today on Premiership business and McInnes may pitch Cosgrove and Main up front together.The Aberdeen manager said: “We’ve looked at certain teams and certain games where we can do it.“We paired them against Hibswhen we had a lack of midfield options and we did it against Kilmarnockwhen they had a suspension.“The two of them can play well together in certain games and I thought the two of them did well on Wednesday.“They made Kilmarnock’s back four defend once they were up their together.

Shay Logan was back in on the right of a four-man defence.Youngster Dean Campbell paired Lewis Ferguson in central midfield.Relegated to the bench were winger Matty Kennedy, who’d started every game since joining from St Johnstone last month, and middle-man Dylan McGeouch. Summer signing Craig Bryson was absent entirely, once more injured – this time with a groin strain.It took until  minutes for the first effort on goal at windy Pittodrie to arrive, Don Cowie fizzing a low long-range effort by the left post.Soon after Niall McGinn curled a free-kick over Ross Laidlaw’s goal from  yards.On  minutes, Campbell was booked for blocking off Josh Mullin, before the Dons won the ball back and Cosgrove – fed by partner Main – pulled a shot across goal from  yards.As the home side started to click into gear, Callum Morris was the second man in referee Gavin Duncan’s notebook, chopping down Cosgrove has he drove forward with the ball.Aberdeen went in front on  minutes. After a McGinn-Campbell corner routine which saw the teenager swing the ball in left-footed and Liam Fontaine fail to deal with the delivery at the front post, Cosgrove nodded down to Main to finish from close range.Just as Pittodrie was thinking “here we go”, Campbell was dismissed by the referee, earning a cheap second booking for not being far enough back at a County free-kick.This meant goalscorer Main was forced to fill the void in the middle of the park by dropping back.The high from the goal had faded, however, the Dons still had the next big opening, with Cosgrove stopped by the sliding Laidlaw at the edge of his box after a great run and through-ball from Connor McLennan. Main then ballooned a second bite at getting a shot away over from distance.County equalised with two minutes of the half to play, Billy Mckay heading ex-Red Richard Foster’s cross beyond Joe Lewis.After the break, the visitors would’ve been in front but for Joe Lewis, with the keeper rushing out to close down Billy Mckay after Scott McKenna played a woeful blind back pass.Lewis then denied Erwin with his foot on the follow-up.Moments later, Lewis Ferguson’s raking effort from  yards hit the Staggies’ left post and Laidlaw done very well to tip away McGinn’s attempt to find the far top corner on the rebound.There followed a period where both sides struggled to create much of note in the final third.The Staggies undoubtedly had the better opportunities of the second period, however.And, with less than  minutes left, Lewis made a fantastic save after Mullin’s effort from the edge of the box was deflected towards the top left corner of the Aberdeen goal.On  minutes, the visitors got their winner.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

The charity works hand in hand with some of the poorest communities in Madagascar to improve their lives and their environment.By addressing people#s primary needs, such as health, sanitation and agriculture, the charity allows them to focus on longer-term challenges, like education, legal tenure and livelihoods.

So far, over , hectares of forest, fauna and flora has been protected.Taking part in the , mile unsupported rowing race across the Atlantic Ocean, the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, the Maclean brothers were setting out to raise £, for two good causes – Argyll charity Feedback Madagascar and Children st.Facing wind, rain, huge waves, fatigue and battery problems, the brothers rowed day and night, repeating shts of two hours of rowing and one hour of rest.One and a half million oar strokes later, they completed the gruelling challenge in an incredible  days  hours and  minutes, winning the trio class and placing third overall. And setting three world records in the process they are the first three brothers to row any ocean, the fastest trio to row across the Atlantic and the youngest trio to row across the Atlantic.In the time it took the brave Maclean brothers to row the Atlantic, Feedback Madagascar was able to undertake their feasibility study for the first BROARhole in Andranomena and begin the project.Breaking ground on the first BROARhole, Jamie Spencer said: #The MacLean brothers have raised so much awareness for Feedback Madagascar since their record-breaking Atlantic row.

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes.

The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence.

What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age.

This should only be done with a full evaluation to understand its effectiveness and impacts.However in the policy revealed on Tuesday by Priti Patel, no mention of the scheme was made, prompting concern from Scottish business owners and politicians that it may not happen at all.The Scottish Government said it was deeply concerned that the proposals have not been mentioned since they were recommended by MAC, and demanded Westminster seriously consider its suggestions of implementing a Scottish visa.Some in the hospitality, tourism and agriculture sectors have already told of how the plans would cripple their businesses, with some firms employing % of their workers who are not from the UK.Home Secretary Patel said thatbusinesses foresee problems with the plan, they should automate their processes or find a dferent way of working, promoting further outcry up and down the country.The Scottish Governments Migration Minister Ben Macpherson has today reiterated the calls for a rural pilot scheme, and has urged Boris Johnsons Government to ensure it is in the policy before changes take effect in January .He said: \"The Scottish Government and many others across the business community and the third sector have made it unequivocally clear to the UK Government that their immigration plans would deeply damage Scotlandrsquos economic, social and demographic prosperity.ldquoThe proposals would be catastrophic for rural areas, which are particularly dependent on migration to sustain local communities and public services, so it is deeply worrying that the UK Government does not appear to mention anywhere in these latest proposals their own prior commitment to running rural migration pilots.ldquoThe Scottish Government put forward a clear, workable proposal for devolving immigration powers and introducing a Scottish visa, which would allow Scotland to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes we need for all our communities and economy to flourish.ldquoThe UK Government must now seriously engage with these proposals, which have widespread support across Scotland.A Home Office spokesman told The Herald on Sunday there were several elements of the policy on immigration still being discussed, with further announcements to be made in the coming months.They could not confirmthe rural pilot schemes would be part of these announcements, but said that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would overly complicate the immigration system and cause signicant dficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff across the UK.A spokeswoman said: \"The UK points-based immigration system will work in the interests of the whole country ndash Scotland included.ldquoIt will attract the brightest and the best from around the globe, boost the economy and our communities as well as ending free movement bringing overall migration numbers down."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-back-stone-age-rubber-pavements-stodge-free-moaning-name-progress","story":"ITrsquoS been another bad week for Extinction Rebellion , and thatrsquos good news for the planet.Most people accept scientic analysis of climate, which says the atmosphere is hotting up at an unsustainable rate, leading to deleterious meteorological phenomena.

It was such bad PR that one suspects theyrsquove engaged PR professionals.Therersquos more than a hint, too, in XR of middle-class larpersturning a serious crisis into cheap drama, taking leading parts for the cameras, dressing in red robes and looking like sententious priests from some weird interplanetary cult on Star Trek.Various predictions since the s averred wersquod all have boiled or frozen or starved to death by .

And, going back through the centuries, you canrsquot help feeling XR is just the latest of these end-is-nigh cults that are a recurring phenomenon of hysteria in human history.Worse is to come for, already, there are people who feel XR isnrsquot going far enough. One such is Professor Patricia MacCormack, of Anglia Ruskin University, who says in her book, The Ahuman Manesto, that giving birth is ldquothe worst thing you can do to the climate.Irsquod some sympathy with this idea at first, until I realised it would lead to human extinction. And sure enough, according to the publisherrsquos publicity, the book ldquoembraces issues like human extinction, vegan abolition, atheist occultism, death studies, a refusal of identity politics, deep ecology, and the apocalypse as an optimistic beginning. Optimistic. I see.According to a review by Margrit Shildrick, guest professor of gender and knowledge productionat Stockholm University : ldquoAs a vegan abolitionist extinctionist, she [MacCormack] provides an unrelenting and exacting take-down of the violent self-interest of the human species ...Elsewhere, Prof MacCormack, who reportedly moonlights as a DJ, complains that the planetrsquos problems have been caused by ldquocreating this hierarchical world where white, male, heterosexual people are succeeding. Yes, terrible business.If this is your polystyrene cup of tea, you can find more on YouTube, where Patricia, or Morticia as shersquos been dubbed, partly for her Goth appearance, discusses ldquovulvic demaonitalia, which I donrsquot need to tell you invokes ldquodemonic convocation as an important ethical feminist and queer practice.Jeez.

Scientists are developing new sidewalk surfaces made from recycled tyres.The purpose is to reduce injuries among pensioners, who have a bizarre habit of falling to the ground. It says here that one in three OAPs takes a tumble each year in Britain, with many suffering hip fractures.But Professor Cesare Sangiorgi, from the University of Bologna, says: ldquo[If] people fall on our pavement, they are less likely to suffer injuries because the severity of the fall will be substantially reduced. It can reduce the burden on the health service.Too right. Apparently, falls cost the NHS pound. billion a year, which of course isnrsquot a true figure but the usual public spending fiction. All the same, falls must cost the service a pretty penny.The new pavement is to be piloted in Sweden, where old people are considered expendable and often used in experiments.No one is denying that old people should buck up their ideas when out walking but, since this is unlikely to happen soon, anything that helps them bounce back on their feet is welcome.Bacterial ersity a no-brainerAW, so to speak, naw.

There are kids that I was with in the early s whotheyrsquore still alive will not have known one day of peace. Anwarirsquos son is -ish and hersquos never known it. It was the th anniversary of the Soviet invasion on Christmas day. ##Readers of this paper, The Herald on Sunday, The Herald and the former Sunday Herald will be familiar with Prattrsquos extraordinary photojournalism and reports from war-torn parts of the world ndash Iraq, Gaza, Syria, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Bosnia.The title of a recent exhibition of his photographs, Only With The Heart, was taken from a quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupery: ldquoIt is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.There are few journalists with more heart, or more commitment to the stories they report on. The focus of this first documentary about his work is Afghanistan because itrsquos a country he has been visiting for over four decades. Itrsquos where a piece of his heart is. ##The idea, he tells says, of reporting from Afghanistan first entered his imagination when he was lying in a bed in a hospital in Nicaragua, feverish with malaria, after he had gone out there, just out of art school, to cover the revolution.As he suffered in the stling heat, he came across a copy of National Geographic with Steve McCurryrsquos iconic image of a young Afghan woman on the cover.ldquoI flicked through and I remember the pictures were of snowy mountains in Afghanistan ndash and I was sweltering in this hospital from malaria and, God, it looked so inviting almost by contrast, he recalls. ##Pratt wasnrsquot a stereotypical war reporter from a privileged background. He was a working-class boy who had grown up in the Hillhouse scheme near Hamilton, which, he says, they used to call ldquoBeirut or Hellhouse. The first time he was ever shot at, he describes, was in the street there, when he was seven years old and someone ldquotook a pot shot at the postman who had failed to deliver his giro benefit cheque, and he happened to be walking nearby.##His background is one of the things that makes his early trips all the more remarkable. ldquoWorking-class people were not meant to do what I was doing, he says. ldquoEvery foreign correspondent at that time was middle or upper class. There were times when I didnrsquot have the #price of a tube fare to come in from my flat in the southside of Glasgow for meetings in the city centre, but I was planning to go to Afghanistan in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoYou would beg, borrow and steal to get the money to get to these places. I feltI ended up getting clobbered in Afghanistan at least theyrsquore not going to come looking for my overdraft. There was a degree of fate about it.##Pratt was looking out at the world at a particular political moment ndash the early s, following the revolution in Nicaragua, the Iranian revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, all of which had taken place in . ldquoAfghanistan wasnrsquot really known at that time, he recalls. ldquoIt was still an obscure backwater. The only thing yoursquod read about it was the hippy trail. But the politics of the region werenrsquot known.ldquoThe religious aspect of it was misunderstood. A lot of the mujahideen groups were Islamist, but they werenrsquot absolutely rabid fundamentalists like the Taliban. They just didnrsquot like the bloody Russians. And can you blame them ##Pratt didnrsquot head out there looking for a specic story ndash though he had an interest in guerrilla movements and underdogs. ldquoI wasnrsquot looking at the grand politics of things, he says. ldquoI was very interested in how people lived. Although the irony is that by the stage I went to Afghanistan, I was very left-wing. I was actually a card-carrying member of the communist party.ldquoIf the mujahideen had known I was a communist it would have been curtains. They wouldnrsquot have waited to find out that I was interested in the notion of resistance and guerrilla movements.##His route into Afghanistan involved illegally crossing the border from Pakistan. The way Pratt tells it, it sounds like after a small amount of research. He flew to Peshawar on a wing and a prayer ndash with few connections. ldquoAfghanaid was my first port of call in Peshawar and they kind of sent me in the direction of one or two mujahideen, but I had to make those approaches myself.##What strikes you almost immediately is how risky his forays into Afghanistan were. He travelled with small groups of mujahideen, slept in caves, moved at night, and, when he fell ill, which he did, would have to be smuggled back out of the country. Often the groups he was with were making -hour marches through the Hindu Kush.He was also highly dependent on the mujahideen guerrillas who took him into the country, people like Sayed Anwari, with whom he formed a close friendship. ldquoWithout them, it would have been impossible. I went back and forward across the border in all these dferent guises. I got caught dressed as a woman in a burka. I went in a coffin, behind grain sacks. Anwari would organise these elaborate ways of getting in and out. I was completely dependent on them.##His le was at risk on countless occasions. In the film, he describes one occasion when he and the group he was with had to beat a retreat from mortar bombardment. ldquoRounds were landing all around you ndash people were going into the air, pieces of them coming off, body parts everywhere.As he and the others around him ran, he passed a man whose knee had been blown off. The man put his hand out asto ask for help, but shells were still landing all around him and he had to run on. ldquoThere is a kind of guilt about that, Pratt says in the film.##You canrsquot help but wonder what his parents and friends must have been thinking. In those times,you travelled in remote areas, you were essentially dropping off the map, cutting all connection with home. ldquoThere were no mobile phones, he says. ldquoThere was no contact. Some of the trips were months on end, and you would cross the border illegally into Afghanistan and disappear off the radar. I might never have come back. ##His parents however, were already used to these disappearances. At  years old, already a keen mountaineer, he was hitchhiking to Glencoe, sleeping under bridges and tackling serious rock-climbing routes. ldquoI was already doing that, so the idea of prolonged absences was no shock to my parents, he says.##The assumption when he was growing up had always been that he would join the military. ldquoIt was a very male-dominated family, says Pratt. ldquoMy uncles were in the military. My father had done his national service in the Middle East. That upbringing instilled in him ldquoan urge to see the world. He goes on: ldquoThe military may have been a way of doing that, but in the end I got really politically opposed to things military. ##Instead he did ldquothe polar opposite and went to Glasgow School of Art, and that was where his journey towards documentary photography began. ldquoSome of my close student friends could see my increasing interest in documentary work. They were seeing a drt towards the political and the fact that a painting was too contemplative for me. The camera was a more immediate tool.##Pratt made scores of trips into Afghanistan during the s. Some were for only two or three days, but his longest was for over three months.What does he think he learned in those early years ldquoIt was mostly finding out about myself, he says. ldquoIt was physically and psychologically very hard. I was on my own. You would be three months in the mountains. My interpreter was a young engineering student from Kabul University who did not want to be a guerilla and didnrsquot want to be hoofing over the Hindu Kush mountains, so when he was given the task by Anwari he actually loathed me because Irsquod got him into this situation. We became great friends. So those long hikes over the mountains were finding out about ourselves.##Pratt kept going back to Afghanistan even after the Soviet withdrawal in . ldquoFrom the s, the mujahideen were bickering among themselves, he recalls. ldquoIt was horrendous and the West was not really interested. I was determined to cover it simply because it wasnrsquot getting covered. No-one was interested now it was Afghans fighting Afghans, not Afghans fighting the Communists any more.##Afghanistan remains war-torn, a precarious and unstable democracy. What happens there is little talked about in the West ndash a recent New York Times editorial described it as ldquoThe Unspeakable War. Meanwhile, the Taliban wages violence and controls many parts of the country.In the documentary, Pratt talks with a Taliban leader by telephone, and is told that peace will only be possible in Afghanistanthe barriers to it are lted ndash and that this would ldquorequire all foreign troops to leave Afghanistan. In recent days that possibility has come closer with the announcement from the Taliban that they are on the threshold of a historic agreement with the USA which would involve withdrawal of troops.##During his film, Pratt s to many of the frontlines from which he reported. The zoo, the site of his startling  image of a sheep wandering across a background of rubble and armoured tank, now feels like a bustling attraction in any city. But, he says, Kabul remains a scary place. When his documentary team visited the Puli Mahmood Kahn district, another former frontline, they were told by their security officers that people up the street were making calls on their mobile phones.ldquoThat area is Taliban central. We bundled into the car and shot off. We had to get up the street and we did a right on to the main highway and the security guy told the driver to do a complete U-turn in the middle of the street and then go back the other way because otherwise the Taliban could ambush us further on. Yoursquore living with that all the time in Kabul.##Pratt went on to cover conflicts in many other parts of the world. The longer he went out for, he says, the harder it would be to adjust. ldquoAfter I was kidnapped in Bosnia, I went to ground for about six months.He also found it hard sometimes to be sympathetic when people back home were stuck on petty concerns.ldquoI remember coming back from Nicaragua, says Pratt. ldquoI was really quite sick and there was a woman on the last leg from Madrid to London and all she went on about was whether the driver she had would be waiting for her at Heathrow airport. Three days earlier Irsquod been in a refugee camp and Irsquod watched them put a machine gun in an adjacent area and fire on the refugees in the camp. Itrsquos dficult not to get angry. But peoplersquos problems are relative. ##For Pratt, the process of making the documentary has been ldquocathartic. The story it tells is of world events, but also his own le. Part of it happens back home, in Glasgow, with his partner, Caron, who has stuck with him through his repeated disappearances ndash a fact he says is ldquoamazing. Recently, he says, he overheard Caron talking about how miserable he was because he was waiting for a visa to go out to Iraq. If hersquos not there when something is happening, she observes, hersquos always miserable.ldquoI remember talking to Marie Colvin about that, he says. ldquoMarie was the worstsomething was happening where. Even when she was on a job she was thinking of the next job. Anditrsquos a part of the world yoursquore really familiar with ndash Afghanistan or Israel-Palestine ndash itrsquos twice as bad. ##Did he ever think about doing anything   ldquoNot really. Once I got into it that was it. The experience of arriving in Nicaragua at dawn, swaying palm trees, and humidity and crickets. Straight out of Graham Greene. Wonderful. You canrsquot go back from that, really. #####The Glasgow Film Festival premiere screening of Pictures From Afghanistan followed by a QA with David Pratt, chaired by Allan Little, is at the Glasgow Film Theatre on Sunday, March , at .pm.

Less than half of that key demographic watch it, boding ill for the future.The BBCrsquos back is against the wall. In our increasingly ided society, people of all political persuasions believe the channel is partisan. The left and right both hate it. Hardline Scottish nationalists and hardline Brexiters detest the BBC ndash itrsquos either part of a treacherous pro-union conspiracy, or in league with Brussels.After the criticism Boris Johnson rightly got for dodging tough interviews during the General Election, the Prime Minister seems ready to come for the BBCrsquos licence fee now. Therersquos speculation about it being replaced with an opt-in subscription model like Netflix.Of course, given that this is Britain in , the debate around the BBCrsquos future will degenerate into yet another front in our endless culture wars and produce much heat but little light ndash like a s TV set.One side will say that any threat to the BBC will see Britainrsquos media landscape turn American, with right-wing propagandists fronting channels like Fox News. The other side will say the BBC is unfairly propped up by taxpayers to the detriment of other media outlets, skewing British cultural le.The future of the BBC will be determined on purely political grounds ndash which is very strange. The BBC must be the only media institution in any democracy which is judged by a political yardstick. Everything  in the media landscape ndash radio, print, cinema, TV, online ndash is judged on much more simple criteria: do people like it and are they happy to pay for it So letrsquos judge the BBC on purely critical grounds. Letrsquos set aside the political wrangle ndash and letrsquos address this central question:the broadcaster vanished tomorrow, would you care in terms of the value and entertainment it brings you As the screw began tightening on the BBC, Irsquove started to monitor my own consumption of its programming. I wanted to see just how important it was in my le. Would I be happy without it I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the BBC plays a much smaller role in my le than I thought. Full disclosure: Irsquove worked for the BBC, and Irsquom also one of those liberal types who has spoken of the BBC as an essential pillar of British le. So, I thought when I began studying my own viewing and listening habits, that given my background the BBC would be both the journalistic and entertainment mainstay of my le. Itrsquos not.My household is media-hungry. We take nearly every TV service there is: terrestrial TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky TV, Apple TV. Wersquove got Alexas in most rooms so we can listen to radio. The house is filled with books, newspapers and magazines. Wersquore happy to pay for media.However, the question is then raised: am I happy with the way Irsquom required to pay for the BBC, compared to how I pay for other media  Would the public be better servedwe could choose the parts of the BBC we wish to pay for These questions come increasingly into focus for me as I find the BBC taking up an ever diminishing sliver of my le. The same seems to be true for many other members of the public.Just look at whatrsquos happening with the BBCrsquos news channel. Of all the services the corporation provides, this is the one I most respect. Itrsquos dependable, impartial, informative. However, like the BBCrsquos drama and comedy output, which is threatened by both homegrown competitors Channel  and international media such as Netflix, the news service is under pressure from viewers consuming current affairs online via sites like Facebook.The reach of the BBC News channel is declining. In the second quarter of , it had  million viewers. Five years previously, there were  million.When it comes to the most popular TV channel, as of September , it was Channel  with a % positivity rating. BBC was second with %, then ITV with %.I find myself agreeing with the public. Itrsquos been a long time since Irsquove watched the BBCrsquos Six OrsquoClock News. I wait for Channel  news at pm. Itrsquos smarter, more international, more in-depth. If I had to pick the channel I get most value from itrsquos Channel . But Channel  isnrsquot put on a pedestal. It provides public service broadcasting and itrsquos commercially self-funded.Irsquod certainly miss BBC Newsnight, in particular the reporting of Emily Maitlis, televisionrsquos best journalist. As to the rest of BBC TVrsquos news and current affairs therersquos not much I couldnrsquot live without. Irsquod certainly survive without the clickbait of Question Time. In Scotland, STVrsquos Scottish news is as good,not better, than BBC Scotland.Radio is a dferent matter. Irsquom very fond of BBC radio. I love Radio  music, I like a bit of Radio rsquos Jo Whiley in the background when Irsquove chores to do, and Irsquom a Radio  fan. One programme Irsquod really miss is Radio rsquos In Our Time with Melvyn Bragg ndash the best and cleverest talk show ever made, I reckon. If the BBC vanished, though, could I happily survive on podcasts and commercial radio, which I find myself increasingly listening to  Probably.The one part of the BBC Irsquod hate to lose is BBC Four. Its documentary output is excellent. From populist history shows fronted by Lucy Worsley and the channelrsquos Friday night music documentaries, to erudite and in-depth explorations of art and science, BBC Four ndash for me at least ndash fulfils the pledge to educate, entertain and inform. Butthe BBC was to disappear, alternatives do exist ndash Sky Arts and a plethora of documentary channels.However, BBC Four is the broadcasterrsquos least-watched channel. In , BBC One had a reach of  million, Channel   million, BBC Two  million, Channel   million, ITV  million. BBC Four had a reach of  million, putting it in the same fighting weight as ITV and Dave.Perhaps thatrsquos because the upstart Netflix has got into documentaries in a big way. The BBCrsquos Storyville strand was once the gold standard of TV documentary making, but these daysyou want to watch an Oscar-winning documentary, or a documentary thatrsquos going to show you things yoursquove never seen before, then Netflix is the place to go. And, of course, therersquos Channel rsquos acclaimed factual output as well, which also easily rivals the BBC.The most remarkable water-cooler documentary of the last year was Tell Me Who I Am on Netflix ndash charting the story of the lives of two adult male twins, one of whom had lost their memory, while the other lived with the knowledge of the history of abuse they had suffered as children.For me, itrsquos BBC One I could really do without. I find its drama output poor, its light entertainment toe-curling. For light entertainment, I head to Channel . If I want something relatively mindless, Irsquoll opt for Gogglebox or First Dates rather than Strictly Come Dancing.In terms of BBC drama, even Line Of Duty or Bodyguard ndash which critics responded to asShakespeare had risen from the grave ndash are in my opinion just cliche-riddled cop shows.If I want original drama then Irsquoll likely turn to Channel  once again, or Netflix, Amazon Prime or Sky with their streaming box sets. You donrsquot get great long-form TV drama on the BBC. A series like Killing Eve is a rarity. HBO is the global hub of the best TV drama, with a pedigree of refined and intelligent programming like The Wire, Six Feet Under and The Sopranos.If you want to watch a great blockbuster series like Game Of Thrones ndash also from HBO ndash then yoursquore more likely to find it on Sky Atlantic than the BBC. A new comedy  Netflix is where Irsquoll look.Therersquos something quintessentially middle-class, middle-aged and middle-brow about BBC drama and comedy. If you distilled BBC drama down into one show it would probably look like Last Tango In Halax. Itrsquos a family saga set in Yorkshire. Itrsquos relatively entertaining, a sort of Cold Feet meets All Creatures Great And Small. Itrsquos cosy ndash as edgy as a butter kne.Channel  drama reflects British le back to viewers in a much more sophisticated way, while Netflix takes you all over the world in a kaleidoscope of genres. Therersquos German thrillers, French horror, Brazilian sci-fi, Belgium cop shows, American comedies, Israeli spy dramas. Itrsquos unusual for me now to watch a long-running show unless itrsquos on Netflix.For films, we never choose the BBC or any other terrestrial channel. We search Sky Cinema, Netflix and Amazon. Why wait until pm to watch a movie on the BBC when you can stream the same movie right now from another service No-one in my house is that interested in sport, but itrsquos how wersquove chosen to opt out of sports programming thatrsquos important, in terms of how the BBC offers its services. With our household Sky package wersquove said no to the sports subscription. Our children are now adults, so wersquove long cancelled the subscription to kidsrsquo programming. Wersquove modelled our Sky subscription around what we like as a family: drama, comedy, films and documentaries.Choice is often hugely overrated ndash just think of all those hours yoursquove spent scrolling through Netflix trying to find something to watch but bewildered by choice. However, flexibility in choosing what you pay for is only fair. Sky understands that I donrsquot like sport so makes it possible for me to buy the bits I want, and discard the bits I donrsquot. The BBC doesnrsquot get it ndash yet.Why canrsquot I pay for the BBCrsquos documentaries, its quizzesand radio ndash and dump the rest  I donrsquot want soaps, terrible Saturday night shows, and mediocre dramas. Irsquom also happy to pay for BBC news. The full-spectrum hatred that BBC news gets proves that in terms of journalism itrsquos doing its job.However, the rest of the BBCrsquos output isnrsquot for me. So reduce my licence fee accordingly. Netflix and Sky have flexible packages, why not the BBC  A flexible BBC subscription fee doesnrsquot immediately mean an end to all Government support. Some state funding could remain. But thatrsquos another discussion.From April, the licence fee will be pound. a year. Make my payment proportional to my consumption. If I want to opt into everything, fine, charge me the full pound.. If I want a slimmed-down package, then charge me a fair share. Netflix, for example, charges for three dferent packages: Basic at pound. per month, Standard at pound., and Premium at pound..Unlike every other media outlet, the BBC doesnrsquot woo me for my money, it demands my money. The others earn it, they persuade me to part with my cash ndash and they donrsquot have the law on their side threatening court.I always thought Irsquod remain a loyal BBC subject. But Irsquom starting to rebel. I donrsquot want to be a subject any longer. Irsquod like to take control of what I pay for. So, in answer to the question I posed myself ndash does the BBC really matter  ndash Irsquom increasingly leaning towards the answer: sadly, less and less.The media landscape has changed ndash but the BBC hasnrsquot. The result is that while once I truly thought I couldnrsquot imagine a world without the BBC, Irsquom coming to the unhappy conclusion that although I wouldnrsquot want to do without the BBC completely,I had to give it up, I could as there are plenty of good alternatives out there now.The only way the BBC can win back people like me is for the broadcaster to change and enter the st century before itrsquos too late."},{"url":null,"title":"jimmy-reid-inside-mind-working-class-hero","story":"JIMMY Reid was haunted by memories of desperate poverty all his le. His early childhood in the Glasgow Gorbals slums, where three of his sisters died in infancy, drove him to fight to improve the lot of working-class people.Born into severe poverty in , Reid was drawn to radical politics as a way to bring about social reform, his heroic efforts for social change earning him the title ldquothe best MP Scotland never had.His passion and charisma, allied to a fearless ability for public speaking, made people from all walks of le sit up and listen ndash eventhey didnrsquot necessarily agree with him.Now a new biography traces Reidrsquos remarkable le from a poverty-stricken background in Glasgow to being thrown into the national limelight as the spokesman for the Upper Clyde Shipbuildersrsquo work-in.The authors of Jimmy Reid: A Clyde-built Man, who will be appearing at the Aye Write! festival next month, interviewed family members, friends and comrades, as well as delving into the University of Glasgow archives to shed new light on how Reid became a symbol of working-class defiance.ldquoWe were bowled over by the audacity of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders shop stewards and by Reidrsquos role as leader and political icon in his own right, and he was arguably one of the greatest political orators since , said Dr William Knox, honorary senior lecturer in Scottish history at the University of St Andrews.His co-author, Professor Alan McKinlay, professor of human resource management at Newcastle University Business School, said: ldquoI was a schoolboy when the UCS work-in happened between  and , and we were one of the schools that collected money for the shipyard workers.ldquoMy dad worked at Rolls-Royce and, like the UCS men, had faced redundancy, and I admired these audacious men who stood up to market forces.Researching the book uncovered some startling revelations about the man who, along with fellow shop stewards Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Gilmore and Sammy Barr, led and won a major industrial struggle.For McKinlay, one of the most striking aspects of Reidrsquos le that emerged from the research was how intensely personal his politics were.ldquoThe image that stayed in my mind was of Jimmy as a young boy watching his father cradle his dying sister in his arms just as midnight struck on Hogmanay and Auld Lang Syne rang out in the streets outside, he said.To Reid, his three infant sisters ldquohad been murdered ndash whatever it said in the death certicate, they should have put down lsquosocial conditionsrsquo as the cause.ldquoHis visceral personal politics came down to this bedrock of morality, said McKinlay.ldquoIt was the devastating impact of poverty and the desire to eradicate it that shaped his politics from an early age, he added. ldquoEven in his last years he never ceased to be emotional when the bells rang out to announce the arrival of the New Year.When the family moved to Govan, their circumstances improved and Reid did well at St Gerardrsquos Senior Secondary, where he was streamed for university and read widely. Once asked by Jonathan Miller, the theatre director, at which university hersquod been educated Reid told him: ldquoGovan public library.Despite his obvious intelligence, Reid left school at  as his ldquoexpectations never involved higher education. I did not know anybody who went to university from the streets of Govan, he would say.Knox was struck by Reidrsquos contradictory nature ndash a product of the macho culture of the shipyards who loved cricket and played the saxophone.ldquoI was surprised to learn that Reid started his working le in a stockbrokerrsquos office, where his employer recognised his ability, said Knox.The young communist firebrand struck up a rapport with the senior partner who promised him a bright career as a future partnerhe stayed on, but Reidrsquos socialist convictions were incompatible with working in a stockbroking firm.However, this early training proved invaluable as it gave him an understanding of the workings of finance capital. He said: ldquoIrsquove always been able to read the stock exchange, and in debates with people it has become quite useful.Reid signed up as an engineering apprentice in the Govan shipyards, but the Scottish shipping industry was already in decline. There were  shipyards on the Clyde in  but by  only nine remained.In , the Heath government attempted to close Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, which had been merged from five yards.Refused further state support, UCS was forced into liquidation despite the yards having a full order book and a forecasted profit for . The shop stewards, including Reid, came up with the idea of a work-in rather than a strike, which would hand victory to the government.They would have ldquocheered us out of the yards, said Reid. ldquoIf we go out on strike, once wersquore out on the street, theyrsquoll padlock the gates. Wersquoll have done their job for them.ldquoThe University of Glasgow archives gave us access to tape recordings of the shop stewardsrsquo private meetings, said McKinlay. ldquoThey were very conscious that what they were doing was unprecedented, and that they were taking on a huge burden that they couldnrsquot mess up.ldquoThe humour of these men really came through ndash that rough, caustic Glasgow humour. People often underestimated Reid because of this sense of humour, and when they heard his accent. But behind all that was an intellect and a breadth of learning.Reidrsquos intelligence and oratorical powers came to the fore during the work-in, and his electrying address to the workforce became famous: ldquoTherersquos a basic elementary right invoked here ndash thatrsquos our right to work. Wersquore no strikers. We are responsible people and we will conduct ourselves with dignity and discipline. There will be no hooliganism. There will be no vandalism. There will be no bevvying, because the world is watching us.The subsequent government climbdown was viewed as a tremendous victory, but the responsibility for saving the livelihoods of thousands of families took its toll on Reid, who was twice admitted to hospital. His daughter Eileen told the authors he was ldquopublic property ... we hardly ever saw him ... our whole lives were taken over ... no normal stuff like going to the swimming baths.His widow Joan said: ldquoHe always whistled coming up the stairs. Andhe wasnrsquot whistling then you knew something was wrong. He never whistled during the work-in.Despite being a household name after helping to save around , jobs, Reid was rejected when he stood as an MP for Central Dunbartonshire. He left the Communist Party but was also defeated in Dundee East as a Labour candidate in  by the SNP and began a career as a columnist and broadcaster. Disillusioned by New Labour, he resigned from the party in  and joined the SNP in .When Reid died in , Govan shipyard workers lined the road as his cortege went past. At his funeral, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: ldquoThe fact there is still a shipbuilding industry in Scotland today is in large measure because of the inspirational campaigns that he waged.McKinlay said: ldquoIf his le had a message it was that morality rather than economics should be the bedrock of policymaking.bullWilliam Knox and Alan McKinlay will discuss Jimmy Reid: A Clyde-built Man at Aye Write! on Sunday, March  at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"climate-comment-can-bit-meet-net-zero","story":"A ldquoclimate emergency needs a robust response. According to the philosopher Peter Springer, developed countries like the UK have an ethical duty to lead the world out of this crisis. After all, the UK has been partially responsible for creating the problem through its past actions. Much of its financial and intellectual capital base has been constructed on a legacy of environmental damage. It needs to put this right.The UK Government is committed to taking the country to net zero by  following the Committee on Climate Changersquos recommendation and analysis of the pathways to net zero. But the committee was also clear that there are huge policy challenges associated with meeting this objective.One of the most sobering aspects of the report from the Committee on Climate Change is the fact that we need to decarbonise the economy across all sectors simultaneously. It isnrsquot good enough to think we can do a little bit of this and then a little bit of that. The scale of this challenge is truly daunting not just for those who need to plan and implement these changes but for every single citizen. This will affect everybodyrsquos le. As I have said before, there is no point putting a bung in the tail pipe of a metaphorical car to stop its emissions without re-engineering, and perhaps even re-imagining, the car itself.Even though government has established a clear national objective, nobody should imagine that this is someone rsquos problem. It is not, as often implied, for government alone to deliver the changes which are needed. The government needs to play its part but there is a job for everybody and for every organisation and business. For example,every decision we make, from buying food in the local supermarket to deciding where to go on holiday, was informed by information about the environmental costs of the dferent options, we could probably make a massive and instantaneous dference. Many people already do this when deciding how much meat they eat, but this is just a start. Even small, almost imperceptible nudges to our decisions could be transformative. Government need to make sure we all have this information and, once delivered, we all have an ethical duty to take it into account.This is why I have taken on the job of leading the aspiration of the University of St Andrews to reach net zero in its own business within the time scales set by government. This university has adopted net zero as part of its strategy and make it a corporate responsibility. My job is to hold it to account and help it to reach its objective.Like any organisation, the university is going to find this dficult. It has already done much to reduce its carbon footprint, but there is only so much it can do on its own. Carbon, and other environmental impacts like water use, permeate almost everything the university does. Wringing the carbon and water out is going to take determination, smart decision-making and imaginative business practice.A university has a special role in the mission to achieve net zero. Apart from being an exemplar to normal businesses, it moulds the future through the research it does and the people it trains. It has global influence through its networks of academics and can itself be a living laboratory for exploring the kind of actions and technical fixes which demonstrate feasibility. A university is not just a crucible for the creation of new ideas but also an integrated part of delivering these ideas to meet the national objectives. It has an opportunity to create impact which is much greater than its size.Sir Ian Boyd is a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews and former Chief Scientic Adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"},{"url":null,"title":"eastenders-anniversary-35-years-hatches-matches-dispatches-rebirths-shape-shifting","story":"A cynic might say the comebacks occur when either the scriptwriters have run out of plotlines or the actors, who set out chasing that Hollywood role, stage or music opportunity, realise that their bread, thick white sliced, is better buttered in Albert Square.Some, of course, never reappear because, that cynic again, their ratings or focus group visibility doesnrsquot cut it.With  deaths in the place since the launch in , the Square is surely the most hazardous place on Earth, more dangerous than Chicago in the thirties or Caracas today.

But they wonrsquot be staying in cosy chalets, as accommodation will be mountaineers huts ndash ldquobothy-like, in the words of one organiser ndash where home comforts are hard to find.But while the facilities may offer the authentic Scottish climbing experience, nerves have been frayed waiting for the weather to play its part.A relatively warm December and January over Scotlandrsquos high ground had meant that the festival was facing poor conditions in gullies and clfs, which are normally cloaked in the snow and ice that makes them an international draw in winter for the worldrsquos mountaineers.But as the weather worsens for everyone , for the mountaineers conditions are improving as the cold, wind and wet moves in.Simon Richardson, one of Scotlandrsquos foremost winter climbers who sits on the organising committee for the festival, said: ldquoParticipants of the International Winter Meet have been anxiously watching the Scottish weather for several weeks now. After the warm December and January the prospects for winter climbing looked bleak.ldquoFortunately, the February conveyor belt of westerly storms has changed all that. There is plenty of snow across the Highlands, and ice is building rapidly. Ben Nevis and the mountains of Glen Coe are ice-making machines that love frequent blizzards and rapid temperature fluctuations.ldquoThe soft aerated Scottish ice occurs in very few parts of the world and is a delight to climb, and ice climbs in Scotland are highly sought after by International climbers.He added: ldquoThis weather trend looks set to continue through the week of the meet, and winter climbers from both the UK and overseas are looking forward to some superb ice-climbing conditions.The winter meet started in  and ran for  years. The last meet was held by the British Mountaineering Council in , but this yearrsquos revival, led by Mountaineering Scotland, recognises the key role that the event has played on the world mountaineering stage, bringing climbers together to share ideas and form new plans.Richardson said: ldquoThe spin-offs of winter meets have been huge. Regardless of the weather, all the meets have been hugely successful and have become a key event in the mountaineering calendar. International partnerships have formed and climbers have shared techniques and equipment. The meet has also helped shape the ethics of world mountaineering.ldquoAt the turn of this century, dry tooling was all the rage ndash highly gymnastic climbing using ice tool and crampons ndash but these routes required extensive preparation with drilled holds and were protected by bolts.ldquoThe Scottish ethic of climbing routes from the ground up and on sight, and not drilling holes in the rock, was in direct contrast to this and, after visiting Scotland, many visitors understood our ethic and have started to apply this more aesthetic approach in other parts of the world.Partnerships formed on the meets have resulted in dozens of important new routes across the world, and helped push mountaineering to new frontiers.Richardson added: ldquoPerhaps the most striking example of this was the first winter conditions ascent of the North Face of North Twin in the Canadian Rockies [which is] higher and steeper than the Eiger and one of the most formidable alpine walls in the world.ldquoIt was climbed by Steve House of the USA and Marko Prezelj from Slovenia in , where they used Scottish approach. Both climbers met on the Scottish winter meet.ldquoSeveral of the worldrsquos greatest ascents in recent years have derived from partnerships created at the winter meet. The most recent example is the UKrsquos Tom Livingstone and Alescaron Cesen and Luka Stra#ar, both Slovenian, who met on the last winter meet in .ldquoIn August , they made the first ascent of the North Face of Latok I in the Karakoram ndash one of the most coveted prizes in world mountaineering. The route was first attempted in  and had defeated  subsequent expeditions. They were awarded the Piolets drsquoOr, the highest honour in mountaineering, for their ascent.During the week, climbers will stay in some of Scotlandrsquos most famous winter climbing arenas, including the Cairngorms, Lochaber and Glen Coe, being accommodated in mountaineering huts such as the famous Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut beneath the massive clfs on the north face of Ben Nevis.The event is being staged with the help of the Scottish Mountaineering Club , the Alpine Club and the British Mountaineering Council, and is sponsored by clothing and equipment manufacturer Salewa.John Fowler, president of the SMC, which owns three of the huts accommodating climbers, said: ldquoThe Scottish Mountaineering Club is delighted to contribute to this international event and welcomes the opportunity to showcase the impressive nature of Scottish winter climbing to some of the best mountaineers from home and abroad.All abilities are represented, with climbers from Israel and South Africa, who have little opportunity to climb snow and ice in their own countries, through to regular winter climbers from Europe, Scandinavia and North America.Host climbers from the UK have been selected to match the abilities of the international mountaineers.These include Paul Ramsden, one of the worldrsquos most accomplished mountaineers and three times winner of the Piolets drsquoOr ndash mountaineeringrsquos highest award.The groups will rotate around each of the locations to ensure everyone gets to experience the ied terrain Scotland can offer.Stuart Younie, chief executive of Mountaineering Scotland, said: ldquoWe want to give the climbers as authentic a Scottish mountaineering experience as possible. In previous years, they would have stayed in a hotel and been based in one place, but here they are staying in the huts right on the doorstep of incredible mountaineering locations.ldquoIrsquod describe the huts as one step up from a bothy.

Those whose parents can afford to pay and those who are granted a concession because they are in receipt of free school meals tend to fill the spaces, but there is an emerging group of pupils in the middle who are being squeezed out of lessons completely.ldquoTherersquos a chasm in the middle where parents will be choosing between getting their car MOTrsquod or paying for music lessons, said North Lanarkshire percussion teacher Kirk Richardson. ldquoThese are people with jobs, who could pay years ago but now canrsquot afford it.ldquoTherersquos a whole middle section there who wersquore not looking after and thatrsquos the sad bit.Some schools are taking action to ensure that group is not squeezed out completely, with the headteacher at Newbattle High School in Midlothian using general school funds to ensure every childrsquos lessons are paid for them.However, Midlothian woodwind teacher Fiona Gray said that while this is an ldquohonourable thing to do, she noted that it is creating as unlevel a playing field within the local authority area as already exists across council boundaries.ldquoNewbattle is in a catchment where lots of children are falling in the middle and are not eligible for free lessons, she said.ldquoTherersquos a bursary scheme but you have to be below a certain level to get it. A lot of pupils are just above that level but their parents canrsquot afford to pay.ldquoThe headteacher is for very honourable reasons paying for all instrumental lessons for all pupils, which is wonderful, but we donrsquot have an equal and fair playing field for pupils in other schools.In the Western Isles, the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is also introducing measures designed to ensure its music service can be maintained at as low a cost as possible, with the council currently only charging for lessons in stringed instruments. Its solution is to make use of its digital learning hub e-sgoil, which sees pupils across the area get face-to-face lessons at least once a month with the remainder provided via video link.Other authorities are taking the Western Islesrsquo lead, with Orkney and Argyll  Bute already using some form of digital learning while Highland, Aberdeenshire and West Lothian are considering it. Dumfries  Galloway, which will look at proposals to axe instrument tuition completely when it meets later this week, is also contemplating an e-sgoil-type approach, although Andrew OrsquoHalloran, local secretary of the EIS union, said the solution is considered to be far from perfect.ldquoWersquove made it quite clear to the local authority that the technology has to be right first, he said. ldquoThe costs involved in introducing a technology solution would be far greater in the first year than the savings [they would make]they cut teachers or introduced charging. That model would be a long-term solution.The reason charging exists at all is that musical instrument tuition is not classed a core part of the education curriculum, meaning the Scottish Government does not provide funding for it as part of its local authority settlement. Though the Government has repeatedly said it expects councils to make music lessons free at the point of delivery, because they are classed as discretionary authorities are free to fund them as they see fit ndash or to scrap them altogetherthat suits their budgetary plans.Campaigner Ralph Riddiough, a lawyer and community musician from Ayrshire, has mounted a legal challenge to the Governmentrsquos position that music lessons are non-core, which,successful, would put the responsibility on the Government to fund tuition for children across Scotland. The Government is due to respond to his challenge at the beginning of next month.Regardless of what that response says, Mr Vipond ndash and everyone  campaigning to safeguard the provision of music lessons in Scottish schools ndash believes the Government must now step up to the mark, class music tutors as teachers who are integral to the education system and fund the service they provide.ldquoThe Curriculum for Excellence is supposed to be about educating the whole child you canrsquot just pick and choose who gets the chance to have a full education, Mr Vipond said.ldquoItrsquos a real shame that this has become a postcode lottery and the Government saying it should be free but itrsquos up to the councils to pay for it is not fair. Theyrsquore washing their hands of the issue.ldquoThey are under a lot of pressure but this is our future.

And the number of recorded crimes increased by  per cent from the previous year.Through its Wild West Web campaign, the NSPCC has been at the forefront of campaigning for better protection for children online since .Last summer, the charity revealed that one in  young people in the UK, aged from  to  years old, who used Facebook or Facebook Messenger had sent, received or been asked to send sexual content to an adult.And with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg planning to allow encrypted messages, which he admitted would protect “the privacy of people doing bad things”, the NSPCC hopes the government will act quickly.Peter Wanless, chief executive officer, said: “The government has signalled it is willing to stand up to Silicon Valley and commit to landmark British regulation that could set a global standard in protecting children online.“For far too long the safety of children has been an inconvenience for social media companies who have left them exposed to harmful content, grooming and abuse. “Tech giants will only do all that they should to stop groomers abusing children on their sitesthe penalties for failure are game-changing.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.cumbernauld-news webimage ..!

Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, said: “Facebook may be happy to shut its eyes to abuse but it can’t close its ears to the unanimous concern shown by international experts.“Mark Zuckerberg has a choice whether to allow sexual abuse to soar on his sites or listen to those from all over the world asking him to rethink how to implement encryption without putting children at risk.”"},{"url":null,"title":"stephen to hold 24 hour charity pt athon","story":"An Inverurie-based personal trainer is holding a -hour fitness event to raise funds for a charity which supported his sister.Stephen Hart, of Hart Fitness, will run fitness classes throughout the day and night on Saturday, February  in aid of CLAN Cancer Support.The personal trainer was inspired to raise funds for CLAN after his sister, Lauren, turned to the charity for support following a breast cancer diagnosis.Lauren, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, accessed CLAN’s services in Inverurie including counselling and wellbeing therapies.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility. Since then, little progress has been made.“What has happened, however, is that the ferries operating these leline routes have got older, less reliable and more costly to run. Despite the best efforts of crews, we have seen increasing levels of disruption, including the ongoing problems with the MV Eynhallow. This situation is simply not sustainable and needs to be addressed.“Scottish Government needs to agree a clear timetable for taking forward the procurement of replacement vessels so that communities in Orkney have the leline services they deserve.

Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Responding to the murders of at least nine people in Hanau, Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were clear signs that the killer had been motivated by racism.Merkel, of the centre-right CDU party, has been described by some as the new ‘leader of the free world’ because of her strong stance against the sinister ideology espoused by those such as the far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Echoing Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he has declared “the age of liberal democracy is at an end” on the grounds that it is no longer able to “provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture”. Normally the US President is the unofficial leader of the free world, but Donald Trump, quite accurately, views Orban as “probably like me”.: Andrew Sabisky: what the former No.  adviser is alleged to have said about pregnancies, eugenics and race as he steps down: Boris Johnson is not a ‘real racist’ despite Brits criticism, says Home Secretary Priti PatelFor Orban, the Christian culture of Europe is under threat from “Muslim invaders” and there is, and always will be, a great iding line between these two religions. He is right about one thing, but wrong about everything .There is indeed a iding line that separates human beings, not just in Europe, but all over the world. On one side of this line are groups like Isis but also far-right killers such as one in Hanau another who massacred  people in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year and the man who killed  people in attacks in Oslo and the island of Utoya in Norway in .The fascists may view the ‘Islamofascists’ as their deadly enemies, but they are fundamentally the same. Disagree with them too much and they will kill you belong to the wrong group and they will kill you.On the other side are the vast majority of people – of all religions and none – who are decent, peace-loving and respectful of others’ basic right to exist.Racism and other forms of bigotry are ideological mechanisms, societal poisons, that can persuade people to cross this line into a le of violence, murder and death.So , on playing a word association game, you say “terrorist” on hearing “Muslim”, beware, because you are heading in a dangerous direction.The basic premise of liberalism – the prevailing philosophy of all true democracies – is that each and every one of us is an inidual. It is, therefore, the antidote to the poison of prejudice.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how to stay rational about coronavirus in the face of panic dr antonis kousoulis","story":"The Covid- coronavirus outbreak may feel scary to some, but it is important to retain a sense of perspective and seek out reputable sources of information, writes Dr Antonis Kousoulis.The UK is a bit on edge at the moment. Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"family of caroline flack share unpublished instagram she wanted to post","story":"The family of Caroline Flack have released an unpublished Instagram post that the star wrote in the days before her death, in which she said that within  hours her whole world and future had been swept from under her feet.The -year-old former Love Island host, who took her own le, described the domestic incident with boyfriend Lewis Burton as \"an accident\".\"On December the th  I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend,\" she wrote. \"Within  hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed.\"I am suddenly on a dferent kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.\"I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night.\"Even on the night.\"But the truth is ...

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce. Mrs Tymelly, played by Bereen who first had the role in the Lyric in , isof everyone’s secrets as well as one of her own.The actress is no stranger to London, but much has changed since she first travelled there: “I worked in London in the s as a nurse – I did midwery in Beckenham Maternity Hospital, a good bit south of the centre. Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le. Organisations like CALM are the best defence we have against stories that end like Joe’s.”CALM runs a free and confidential helpline and webchat for anyone who needs to talk about le’s problems, available in NI and across the UK.‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ runs until February .Stage set forof one-woman Ruby show Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"pipe band championships to be held in antrim","story":"Around , visitors are expected to attend the second Antrim and Newtownabbey Regional Pipe Band Championship event at Antrim Castle Gardens in June.The event is being organised by the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association of Northern Ireland .The borough council will host the event at a cost of £,.Traditionally, this competition is held on the third Saturday in July but it has been switched this year to avoid a clash with the annual Antrim Agricultural Show in Shanes Castle.The organisers turned down the opportunity of holding the event at V at The Valley, in Newtownabbey.Meanwhile, a craft event is to be moved to an indoor location following concerns over weather and a subsequent reduction in visitor numbers.Mossley Mill has been recommended as the venue for ‘Spinning Yarns’ this September at a cost of £,.The event was held at Antrim Castle Gardens for the past two years and is said by council officers to be “challenged by poor weather”.Although this is described as “an ever present risk year round for any outdoor event but particularly challenging for the audience profile for this specialist event”.Council officers have stated that the numbers “reduced signicantly” to , last year, from , in , which they have acknowledged was “disappointing”.“There is no doubt the poor weather and warning issued impacted upon this.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

There is much more ‘going ons’ than merely learning lines and ‘tech’ work as the -strong cast fill the stage and raise the roof with their storming ‘Another Op’nin, Another Show’ number. The pace throughout is fast and crackles along towards the interval as Fred and Lilli lock horns but work to bring the show to le.Matthew Cavan, a familiar face to many as his cabaret drag act alter ego ‘Miss Cherry Ontop’ welcomes the audience to Act Two with a belter rendition of its ‘Too Darn Hot’ as the whole cast weave in and out of the stalls onto the stage. A special mention must go to Marty Maguire and Darren Franklin, two mobsters looking to ‘collect’ but take time to tell the audience to ‘brush up their Shakespeare’ in a classic comedic set piece. Cast and crew’s energy throughout the two hour running time is infectious as we hurtle towards the finale and the question of can or should the ‘Shrew’ be tamed  A timely question for our age.The Lyric and NI Opera’s co-production is a high octane, visually beautul way to kick start the Lyric’s  programme. The ‘Wunder’ bar has been set very high indeed.Kiss Me, Kate runs at the Lyric Theatre until February .

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example. The ‘crisis’ question was, why would the Scottish and Irish be granted an ethnicity status while the English were left out of this Well, the ethnicity question I am interested in here also brings the African to the table.•Elly Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renewed calls to open historic cemetery","story":"THERE have been renewed calls this week for Belfast City Council to re-open the historic Clton Street Cemetery to the public.The gates at the Henry Place site are locked to the public and can only be accessed by prior arrangement with Council officials.Local Sinn Féin councillor JJ Magee seconded a motion brought by colleague Geraldine McAteer calling out Council for their neglect of the historic graveyard which has led to undergrowth along its perimeter walls and accelerating deterioration of a number of headstones.Speaking to the North Belfast News, JJ Magee said: “We have tourist signs that guide walking tours and visitors from the city centre up to Clton Street Cemetery only for people to find out the gates are closed.“We are pushing Council to get the gates opened and make it a facility for tourists and local people.“I have been disappointed with the slow response from Council so we brought forward this motion to get a report back.“It is a massive asset for the people of Belfast with huge history. It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic and travel alerts latest updates","story":"Latest traffic and travelThe road has been closed. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Snow and ice could cause problems on Wednesday  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLatest traffic and travelFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFollow the latest updates from our travel feed belowPolice have erected tape and cones at a derelict building in Waterside Street in Coleraine due to falling masonry.

The win takes Rory Gallaghers men onto five points in the table, into third place on score dference behind Longford and ahead of Down and Offaly. The Oakleafers head to Paacuteirc Uiacute Chaoimh on next week to face leaders Cork before hosting Longford and travelling to Offaly on the last week of the campaign. Derry, playing against the wind, went into a - to - lead with points from Shane McGuiganand Benny Heron. googletag.cmd.push A McGuigan goal helped Derry into a - to - advantage by the eight minute, before Louth recovered to leave just a goal between the sides after  minutes. WATCH - Rory Gallaghers thoughts on Derrys win In the seventh minute, Derrys dominance paid off. A kick-out from Lynch was won by skipper McKaigue. When the play developed forward, Niall Toner drew goalkeeper Craig Lynch before offloading for McGuigan to palm to an empty net. Then came the talking point of the first half when Padraig Cassidy was unceremoniously hauled to the ground by Dermot Campbell but no penalty was given. googletag.cmd.push To rub salt into the wounds, Louth had the ball in the net seconds later. Ryan Burns took advantage of a mix-up and intercepted Odhraacuten Lynchs pass to set upDeclan Byrne for the easiest of goals and the sides were level, - each. Derry led - to - at half-time but Burns curled over two frees to put them into the lead for the first time in the game. McGuigan, who finished with -, levelled matters before Shea Downey floated over the bar. Derry were reduced to  men following Padraig McGrogans black card with six minutes of normal time remaining. The home side eventually broke Louths resolve with a Niall Loughlin goal. The Greenlough man was making a first appearance since Derrys  qualier defeat to Mayo and he palmed home from a Toner pass. Louth replied with two Burns frees and there was just the kick of a ball between the teams again before a curling McGuigan free sealed victory. Gerard McSorley and Brendan Rogers were both dismissed on a second yellow cards, at dferent times, in the closing stages but it mattered little as Derry held on.

Harry Gregg, a legend of the game, passed away this week aged . Gregg’s funeral took place in St Patricks Parish Church on Friday, followed by interment in Coleraine Cemetery. Books of condolences have been opened in both the National Stadium at Windsor Park and at Coleraine Town Hall.Gregg was capped  times for Northern Ireland between  and  but is most well-remembered across the world for his time at Manchester United. His career on Manchester was marred by one of the greatest tragedies of world football, the Munich air disaster. On  February , British European Airways Flight  crashed on its third attempt to take off from Munich-Riem Airport, West Germany,  people died that day, many of them Manchester United players. It has been well recorded, the bravery and actions of Gregg on the site of the crash, having survived, he ed to save a -month old baby, her badly injured pregnant mother and dragged Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet from the wreckage by their waistbands.Tony O’Doherty, Derry City Director and former Northern Ireland footballer, got to know Gregg during summers in Coleraine as a boy. “Harry would have been there, training in the Showgrounds with Victor Hunter and Ian McFaul. Its quite amazing when you think of it, I never realised as a boy but it was three international goalkeepers.”Tony remembers a humility about Gregg that could sometimes be sharp. “Harry was the most down to earth person you ever met in your le, but be prepared because he would know you five minutes and he would very quickly tell you what he thought of you,” he laughed. googletag.cmd.push PlauditsThe plaudits and title of hero never sat well with Gregg who remarked in his autobiography, “Munich has cast a shadow over my le which I found dficult to dispel.” Tony said it seemed that Harry distanced himself from Munich, “Certainly in my company and from people closer to him say, he never talked about it.”Gregg was a teacher in those times, not to outfield players like Tony but to the international goalkeepers around him. “Certainly as a young player he would have watched me and chatted to me but any tips would have been for goalkeepers,” he said. “He must have known something about the goalkeeping arts, to become an international. You knew he was something special. When I was growing up in the game we used to say, I’m sure they still do now, that goalkeepers were ‘mad’ in the nicest sense of the word.” googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Harry Gregg made his name with Manchester United, Northern Ireland and as a hero of the Munich Air Disaster. That huge personality and ‘something special’ was deployed on the pitch and was part of Gregg’s game. O’Doherty says, “That larger than le character was how he kept out goals as well, people talk about commanding your penalty area, Harry certainly did, make no mistake.”Tony struck a relationship with Harry in that time and regularly bumped into Gregg. “My last memory of him was  or  years ago, during Victor Hunter’s testimonial and I actually played in it believe it or not, along with Teddy Sheringham,” he recalled. “I went to go off at half time. Teddy told me, ‘you’re not going off, you’re my legs!’Just as I pulled up to get to that game, Harry pulled in beside me and I had a chat with him.” “He wasn’t just larger than le outside the game he was larger than on the pitch.” Harry Gregg played  times for United, and as it has been remarked in the last few mournful days, his strength of will and character was epitomised in a - win over Sheffield Wednesday, just  days after the Munich tragedy.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose. It can act as a driver for future investment in this area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Archaeologists.jpg","title":"Archaeologists find ‘treasures’ during dig  ","story":"SOME of the medieval lsquotreasuresrsquo unearthed during a dig at Down Cathedral last year will be revealed next month.Excavation director Brian Sloan from the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork, Queenrsquos University Belfast, will display several of the items recovered when he gives a talk at Down County Museum on Wednesday, March , from .pm.Last summer archaeologists from the centre, working alongside members of the community, discovered hundreds of medieval artefact in a dig at a site adjacent to Down Cathedral.More then  people took part in the dig mdash most of them young mdash while it also attracted some , visitors to come along to view the process.An earlier community dig in  had exposed a medieval kitchen building and associated rubbish pits at the siteLast yearrsquos dig went further and produced hundreds of medieval artefacts, including some surprises, reinforcing the importance of Downpatrick during the medieval period and before.Some of the artefacts included medieval pottery, animal bones, bronze pins, an Early Christian cross slab and a bronze section of a medieval cross with settings for precious stones.Wooden barrel staves were found at the bottom of one pit and Mr Sloan at the lecture will reveal how they have been dated.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey encouraged all those interested to attend the free event.He said: ldquoThe archaeological excavation revealed some very exciting and unusual objects and shows how important this site was in the medieval period.The attendance at the dig during the summer shows how widespread interest is in archaeology and this talk will provide people with a great opportunity to find out more.The dig was part of a series of projects funded by Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilrsquos PEACE IV programme.The digs were designed to find out more about le in the past, but also to help people understand local history and culture and gain skills in working in archaeology.Members of the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork spent five weeks investigating the site working alongside volunteers.The archaeological project was supported by

that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run

Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE and the MoD to address the power supply on as soon as possible.Last night the Ministry of Defence indicated that it had been working with NIE Networks and ldquoawaited confirmation of the proposed works.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the

All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

This film is her fight to understand the events that shaped her le, in order to move on.The storyline has some parallels with her own le as before her family moved to New York, her father was sentenced to six years in the former Long Kesh prison after being arrested in  on suspicion of carrying a weapon.Apart from writing and filming The Shore at Killough, which was produced by Oorlagh, Terry early earned his film-making credentials as the screenwriter for the film, In the Name of the Father , based on the story of the Guildford Four and wrote the screenplay and directed Some Motherrsquos Son .He has since gone on to write other major films such as The Promise in .While Oolagh worked alongside her father in some of his productions, she has branched out on her own and is currently developing a television drama called Faultline, which she co-created with The Wire writer, Edward Burns.It took six years for Oorlagh Georgersquos screen play of Stranger with a Camera to make it into production. The project has been developed through Sundance Institutersquos Screenwriting and Directing Labs.Oorlagh is producing the film with Mary Ann Marino , Molly Egan , and John Wallace .The film is supported by Sundance Institute, Northern Ireland Screen and Screen Ireland, with additional grant support by The Utah Film Centre and Artemis Rising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Schoolchildren.jpg","title":"Schoolchildren name social housing scheme in Crossgar  ","story":"A NEW social housing scheme in the heart of Crossgar has been officially named.Work on a scheme by Clanmil Housing to build  homes on a former derelict site in Downpatrick Street is nearing completion and has been named Everogue Lane.Housing officials approached Glasswater Primary School and Cedar Integrated Primary School to ask pupils to take part in a competition to name the new development by coming up with an imaginative name that would reflect the sitersquos surroundings or some other interesting aspect of the local area.A total of  entries were received from P pupils at the two schools, the most imaginative of which were submitted to Newry, Mourne and Down Council to select the winning name.The developmentrsquos new name reflects the original name for the village, Everogues Bridge, before it became known as Crossgar, with the winning name a combination of ideas from former Glasswater pupil Grace Chapman and Gabriel Gormley, a former pupil at Cedar.Clanmilrsquos community cohesion officer, Philip Whyte, presented Grace and Gabriel with Amazon Fire tablets in recognition of their creativity.ldquoWe are delighted by the interest that the children have shown in our development and very impressed by the standard and range of names suggested, he said.ldquo Well done to everyone who got involved and thank you to the schools for helping with the competition.ldquoCongratulations to Gabriel and Grace who have together come up with the perfect name for the scheme.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out. They have been behind us the entire way.Shane believes that he and Connor, whorsquos originally from South Devon, were meant for each other.ldquoFor me, it was definitely love at first sight. Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple.

He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

A  paramilitary report used convoluted language to say republicans believed that such influence still existed. The PSNI has said little in the meantime, seeming instead to want to show republicans a friendly face.It is not just the PSNI but legal, security and political figures who appear to be at pains to avoid making judgement. The Independent Reporting Commission is clearly not the body to give us a comprehensive assessment of the IRA and any influence that the terror group has on politics and society here. We need a new organisation for that vital role.While Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar’s remarks are welcome, and while Mr Martin has long been critical of Sinn Fein, it is too late. Dublin put no pressure on republicans in Northern Ireland, despite their intermittently disgraceful conduct after , or their post  veto on devolution until their blackmail got reward in a powerful Irish language commissioner.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
