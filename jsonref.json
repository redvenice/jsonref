Debbie Zurick (above, with her husband John) was found with gunshot wounds at her marital home          It certainly wasn\u0027t unusual to see either of the Zuricks with an uncocked rifle slung across an armA friend told MailOnline: \u0027Debbie and John split up a few months ago and she went to live in Ireland to get away from it all.\u0027Jamie was an old friend of both Debbie and John and she enjoyed spending time in Ireland. She was exasperated with their relationship. She needed some time away to clear her head and decide her next move.\u0027Debbie returned to the cottage because of the dogs and John had just found out about the new man in her life.\u0027 One neighbour said: \u0027Debbie wanted a separation. Things came to a head over the last couple of weeks. I\u0027ve been told that she\u0027s dead and that is such awful news - particularly as she seemed to be recovering well from cancer treatment.\u0027         Pictured: Debbie and John Zurick with their dogs. Police have opened a murder probeMr Zurick had hoped for a reconciliation and was deeply upset when he discovered his wife had a new boyfriend.Mrs Zurick, who is said to have been treated for cancer, is believed to have been shot when she returned to the cottage on Saturday with a female friend to collect some possessions and take care of the dog breeding business.Mr Ryan, a keen fisherman in his mid-sixties, is the great grandson of baronet Sir James Power, who was an Irish Liberal politician and governor of the Bank of Ireland and who died in 1877.He saw his own marriage to local head teacher Mary Stratton Ryan collapse several years ago.He and Mrs Ryan were close friends with the Zuricks and they had stayed at the Ryan home in 2011.         The Zuricks bought the property, where the Prime Minister spent some of his childhood, from Stanley for £440,000 in 2013A family friend said of Mr Ryan, who was unavailable for comment: \u0027Jamie is very well liked around here.\u0027I know that after his marriage broke down, Jamie went to live in Galway for a period before coming back. Jamie\u0027s ex-wife Mary is a picture restorer and a head teacher.\u0027But they are very private people, so nobody really knows what happened between him and his wife.\u0027Mr and Mrs Zurick bred and trained clumber iels and lived in their cottage where they were neighbours of Stanley Johnson, father of PM Boris.The Zuricks bought the property, where the Prime Minister spent some of his childhood, from Stanley for £440,000 in 2013.Stanley owns the neighbouring 14th century farmhouse on the Nethercote estate with his wife Jennifer. A third house on the estate is owned by the Prime Minister\u0027s sister Rachel.There are also a number of barns, which have been converted into properties, whose owners include Boris and his brother Leo.         Princess Anne, 69, expressed her sadness after learning that Debbie Zurick, who worked for her, had been shot dead. (Pictured second right with the Queen\u0027s daugthter is John Zurick, who allegedly shot his wife)A photograph on Mr Zurick\u0027s Facebook page from March 2016 appears to show Mr Johnson outside the cottage in Winsford, near Minehead, with one of the couple\u0027s dogs, also called Boris.Stanley this week told the Daily Mail: \u0027Both I and my whole family are shocked, stunned and saddened by this tragic incident.\u0027We very much regret the passing of Mrs Zurick. She was a neighbour and she was much loved.\u0027She was honorary secretary of the Working Clumber Spaniel Society and was much loved for the work she did, in the society and in Exmoor and beyond.\u0027The Zuricks were regulars at game shoots and were key figures in the Working Clumber Spaniel Society, of which Princess Anne is president.On the society\u0027s website, Mr Zurick describes how he trained Anne\u0027s dog Sparkle but received a rebuke from the princess when the hound failed to bring back a pheasant.Mr and Mrs Zurick had no children. Mr Zurick\u0027s son from his first marriage died in 1995, aged 17.Police have begun a murder investigation and are continuing to search the property but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.Detective Superintendent Julie Mackay said: \u0027This is a very serious incident in which a woman has lost her life. Due to prior police contact with those involved, a mandatory referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\u0027It would be inappropriate for us to go into further details while the referral is being considered.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Be kind Danny Cipriani leads Gloucester teammates touching tribute Caroline Flack","story":"Share this article          Danny Cipriani of Gloucester Rugby is pictured wearing a shirt with the words Be Kind on the back as a tribute to Caroline Flack during the the Gallagher Premiership Rugby match between Gloucester Rugby and Sale Sharks at Kingsholm Stadium on February 28The match tribute comes after Cipriani shared a message Flack had sent him about the court case she was facing before her death.On Wednesday he posted a screenshot on Instagram of a recent WhatsApp exchange between the pair.After Flack said she was \u0027OK\u0027, Cipriani asked: \u0027Why you just OK?

The hate she aims at me.\u0027Flack\u0027s message was thought to be referring to Jamil\u0027s criticism of a Channel 4 programme she was part of called The Surjury, which featured people pitching ideas for their dream surgeries to convince a jury of peers and experts to approve their life-changing operations.

The profile, which belonged to the O\u0027Neill\u0027s youngest son, who was 11, showed a caricature of a black person along with the racist term which Sturridge and his guests found offensive. Pictured: Sturridge has played 26 times for England and 116 league appearances for LiverpoolJust days before the discovery, Sturridge had been charged with allegedly breaching FA betting rules, for which he received a £75,000 fine and six-week ban, four of which were suspended. And the relationship between Sturridge and his girlfriend and the O\u0027Neill\u0027s appears to have become difficult after the discovery of the profile.The family claimed to have been offended by a letter which Sturridge and Ms Ferreira sent suggesting that that the O\u0027Neills\u0027 older children were in the wrong if they had ignored the existence of the account.          Court documents reportedly show that the O\u0027Neills, who had moved to California with their children, \u0027profusely\u0027 apologised to Sturridge and Ms Ferriera and said they were not aware of the accountThe O\u0027Neills felt that they were being accused of being bad parents. Correspondence between the families then became heated when the O\u0027Neills pursued Sturridge in the county court for £67,000 of unpaid rent.Sturridge paid the rent in July 2019 but then filed a separate claim for damages \u0027in respect of the defendants\u0027 discrimination against them andor harrassment on the grounds of their race\u0027.  Mrs O\u0027Neill then contacted Ms Ferreira to apologise but Sturridge and his girlfriend wrote a letter explaining how they found the word \u0027profoundly offensive.\u0027 Mr O\u0027Neill then wrote a long reply in which he insisted he and his wife had \u0027profusely apologised\u0027 for their son\u0027s mistake. He went on to say that they had received the most \u0027shocking and disrespectful\u0027 letter from Sturridge and Ms Ferreira which included \u0027harmful\u0027 words about their eldest children.  Daniel Sturridge sues landlord over N-word on child’s Netflix account | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Why Prince Andrews lawyers secret","story":"Share this article The FBI, US prosecutors and lawyers for Epstein\u0027s victims want to speak to Andrew as part of investigations into the disgraced financier\u0027s sex trafficking ring. Ms Roberts, now known by her married name Giuffre, claims she was trafficked to London and coerced into having sex with the Prince on three occasions in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands. The Duke has categorically and repeatedly denied her claims.Last month, US attorney Geoffrey Berman said prosecutors and the FBI had contacted the Duke\u0027s representatives but had received no reply. Andrew was said to be \u0027angry and bewildered\u0027 about the claims, saying he had not been approached to speak about the case.But in the increasingly bitter war of words, Mr Boies supported Mr Berman\u0027s account, adding: \u0027We have continued to be met with an absolute refusal to co-operate in our investigation. An absolute refusal to be interviewed.\u0027         Ms Roberts claims that she was flown to London by Epstein in March 2001 when she was 17 and coerced into having sex with the Duke (pictured together with Ghislaine Maxwell)       Mr Boies also said that the whereabouts of Ghislaine Maxwell remain unknown. The socialite disappeared from public life around 2016, although Prince Andrew told BBC\u0027s Newsnight that he saw her as recently as last spring or summer, saying: \u0027She was here doing some rally.\u0027Mr Boies added: \u0027We heard she was in California, the South of France, Israel, the UK… We have not been able to establish any credible evidence of where she actually is.\u0027Mr Boies said our story last week that a former Royal protection officer had raised questions about Andrew\u0027s \u0027alibi\u0027 for the night he allegedly had sex with Ms Roberts in London in March 2001 was \u0027significant\u0027. He added: \u0027All the evidence that has come out is supportive of what Virginia has said.\u0027He also urged Scotland Yard to reopen its investigation into the claims made by Ms Roberts, now 36. She made a criminal complaint against Epstein and Maxwell to the Met in July 2015, but in November 2016 Scotland Yard decided not to proceed with an inquiry.It is understood the complaint did not include any criminal allegations against the Prince.\u0027Both in the UK and the United States, prosecutors failed to pursue evidence of Epstein\u0027s sex trafficking that was presented to them,\u0027 Mr Boies added.

Aged three or four, he was left in a car in a supermarket car park not for long, maybe a few minutes, but long enough to wonder if his parents might not come back. The feeling never left him: “In a child’s mind, it is possible to be alone for ever.”Somehow, in his subconscious, that feeling of potential abandonment attached itself to animals. He was disturbed by the way humans might silence or confine animals, in zoos or on farms, even at home. Years later, he wanted to find a harmless way of photographing that feeling.How to do it? First, he wandered around his neighbourhood in east London looking for cars with a bit of cinematic glamour, then he left a note on the windscreen saying: “Can I photograph your car and put a dog in it?” To get the dogs, he sidled up to their owners in parks and asked them if he could put their dog in a car at night and photograph it in the name of art. He was astonished that most said yes.His new book contains nearly 50 of these set-ups.

Snapchat feeds capture your entire day, Instagram users meticulously curate their pages and stories, and detailed Twitter threads recount what happened on the morning commute. We are storytellers, narrators, transmitters of tales – occasionally those of others but mostly our own. We’ve been assured we all have a story and what we need is the courage and space to tell it. But these days it’s not enough just to have an experience, or even just to share it. People feel compelled to claim stories, to plant a flag and proclaim: “This is mine.” Instinctively, some people privilege their own experience over any other that their story is always the “authentic” one.When that story is rooted in trauma, a whole host of ethical implications suddenly come into play. How do we tell the story of such experiences? Why should we? To what extent does it desensitise the audience to future stories? And perhaps the most pertinent question, at least in this Era of Authenticity, is: who gets to tell it?Enter My Dark Vanessa. Kate Elizabeth Russell’s debut, for which she reportedly received a seven-figure advance, is one of the most hyped books of 2020. (These two points are not unrelated.) The novel opens in 2017 when, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Vanessa learns that her former English teacher – with whom she had a relationship in high school – has been accused of sexual assault by a former student. The allegations cause her to re-evaluate her own past with him.At the start of the year (and hot on the heels of another controversy concerning a much-hyped book with a big deal behind it), Latinx author Wendy C Ortiz wrote that the premise and marketing for My Dark Vanessa was “eerily” similar to that of her 2014 memoir Excavation, about her teenage sexual experiences with an English teacher. The Twitter mob kicked into high gear, levelling plagiarism charges at Russell and accusing her of being another white author co-opting and profiting from the experiences of marginalised communities. In a January essay, Ortiz shared that Russell had told her she’d read Excavation – alongside other material (naturally) in the 20 years she spent writing My Dark Vanessa.Although Ortiz is careful not to use the P-word, she questions Russell’s rationale in writing a novel about sexual abuse, and for “mining books that deal with the subject” in order to write it. Her use of the words “fictionalise” and “sensationalise” are worth noting as they seem to imply, in the case of the former, that a white woman cannot experience that kind of trauma, and in the case of the latter, that a novel is not an appropriate way to relate such an experience. When people began demanding that Russell prove she lived through the experience her novel represents (one shudders to think what such evidence might consist of), Russell revealed that My Dark Vanessa is based on experiences she had as a teenager. “I do not believe that we should compel victims to share the details of their personal trauma with the public,” she wrote in a short statement, sharing her fear that “opening up further about my past would invite inquiry that could be re-traumatising”.Here we come to the crux of the matter. It’s bad enough that people now feel comfortable telling novelists what they can and can’t write about, but this controversy brings to the fore something more disturbing – the notion that you must have lived trauma in order to write about it, and that there’s only one way of narrating it, namely through some autobiographical medium. Is it inconceivable that a person might choose to articulate their experience from behind the veneer of safety that fiction provides?Whether it’s to afford themselves some distance from a traumatic memory or to avoid reactions from loved ones (writers may have friends and family they do not wish to disclose such experiences to), fiction offers space to explore and work through sensitive, complex topics. Do we really want to get into a position of dictating how someone should write about such experiences?Aspiring novelists are frequently given the oft-misunderstood directive to “write what you know”, and there’s a long history of debut novels by women being seen as thinly veiled autobiography my own debut, which deals with the unacknowledged trauma of a young woman, was treated the same way. That a fiction writer could have experienced the trauma their novel narrates has long been assumed by the public, critics and academics, but this demand that a novelist prove such a thing feels new and more-than-a-little alarming.Whether or not Ortiz believes that Russell’s note regarding her own experiences is, like her admitting to reading Excavation, “a little too late”, when she says she has no interest in a fictionalised account of something she lived through, I understand her grievance. It goes back to ownership of an experience and strikes at the heart of the ethics of trauma representation. When you’ve survived something monstrous, attempts by others to create art from it can seem offensive, as though it diminishes the singularity of your experience – particularly if you think your own story has been overlooked.Another dimension to this is that we read novels and watch films and look at art because we derive some pleasure from them. When that pleasure is built on someone’s very real pain, it produces a profoundly uncomfortable tension. The question, though, is where do we draw the line? Can you only write about war if you’ve lived through it? What about cancer? Addiction? Mental health? Domestic violence? Do you have to produce evidence of your own personal experience with such trauma in order to fictionalise it?The last couple of years have seen a necessary call for #OwnVoices across the writing community, a desire to amplify the voices of marginalised authors. However, this has become conflated with an #OwnStories argument, which is not the same thing and is not necessarily the role of fiction. We have life-writing for that, and we cannot allow ourselves to normalise the policing of novelists.A more erse industry would mean a copy editor could point out that the Spanish in the text is not quite right for where the story is set. It would mean a cover designer who wouldn’t immediately be drawn to the most stereotypical motifs. It would mean a commissioning editor or a publicist who is embedded in marginalised cultural and artistic outlets. A more inclusive field would mean more erse books catering to a more nuanced and erse audience. It would mean publishers willing to throw their weight behind riskier books. Until the industry starts to view ersity as more than a box-ticking exercise, we’re destined to see more controversies about who gets to write what and how.• The Pact We Made by Layla AlAmmar is published by Borough (£8.99).

What if we looked to the other side of the Mediterranean to find the most exciting collective adventures, to discern the outline of a new form of democracy where people questioned violence, economic power and the development of society in a new way?Between 2011 and 2019, popular uprisings changed the destinies of first Tunisia and then Algeria. I was on Avenue Bourguiba when the Jasmine revolution began, and I have some extraordinary memories of those moments shared with the Tunisian people. I covered Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali’s Tunisia as a journalist from 2008 to 2011, and I had the feeling at the time that this country and its youth were dying. Young people were being driven to illegal emigration and suicide by the nation’s ills: police brutality, the economic crisis, endemic corruption and mass unemployment. Tunisia had been undermined so deeply and systematically by its ruling regime that it was hard to see a way out of the situation. In Algeria, similar causes produced comparable effects. And there was a sense of amazement there too, among observers and the protesters. As the Algerian journalist and author Kamel Daoud put it: “We had forgotten that we were a people, and in the street, we were united once again, amid joy and laughter.”In Europe, nobody had forecast the rise of these popular movements because it was nearly 10 years since the European Union has stopped taking an interest in the Maghreb. When I was a student, the Mediterranean was still talked about as a sphere of influence on Europe. Remember Turkey presenting its arguments for joining the club of 27 member states? Even Morocco did not exclude the possibility of gradually joining the union. There’s a story that King Hassan II hired teams of Moroccan and Spanish engineers to make a presentation – at a meeting with Jacques Delors, who was president of the European Commission at the time – for his plan to build a bridge that would connect Africa to the Old Continent. In 2008, the French president Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to pursue this dream of bringing together the peoples of the north and south by launching the Union for the Mediterranean. But no solid union could ever be forged with a band of dictators such as Muammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad and Hosni Mubarak.I am from the Maghreb I am from the Mediterranean. My attachment to Europe was built across that sea. For me, mare nostrum was not a border and not yet a cemetery it was the outline of a community. In Homer, the Mediterranean is hygra keleutha, the liquid road, a space of transition and sharing. It is our common heritage. Odysseus made stopovers on the coast of Africa just as he did in the Greek islands. When I first visited Spain, Portugal and Italy, I was struck by this feeling of familiarity. So how can we explain Europe’s current inability to face that sea? How can we understand the way it has deliberately turned its back on the Mediterranean, when this southward tropism is one of the most fortunate aspects of our continent? We have lost the sea and betrayed that essential part of our identity. How devastating to see the youth of the Maghreb and Africa turning away from the continent that has rejected them and let them down.The Austrian author Stefan Zweig devoted a large part of his critical work to the European question. In an article published before the second world war, he writes that a Russian exile once told him: “In the old days, a man had only a body and a soul. Now, he needs a passport too, otherwise he is not treated like a man.” And Zweig, who saw the European continent sink into the horrors of fascism and genocide, adds: “The first visible manifestation of our century’s moral epidemic was xenophobia: the hatred or, at the very least, the fear of the other. Everywhere, people defended themselves against the foreigner, they excluded and separated him. All those humiliations that before had been reserved for criminals were now inflicted on travellers.” And still today, the question of migration is fundamental, central, because the future of our continent will be decided in terms of our capacity to welcome and also to think about the Other.The European Union, built on the ruins of the second world war, was intended to be an incarnation of pacifism and the virtues of dialogue. Whether through Schengen or Erasmus, it championed the ground-breaking idea of a future based on reducing borders and encouraging the circulation of people, products and ideas. It is easy to forget this now, but when the European project was first conceived by its founding fathers, it was profoundly innovative, even subversive. Turning its back on a warlike, dog-eat-dog vision of the world, the European Union was designed to promote mutual assistance and cooperation. It seems such a sad waste that this democratic ideal is now considered by some to be a sort of outdated, rancid utopianism, while nationalist speeches are cheered, and walls are being built on our doorsteps.But the EU also bears some responsibility for what has happened to it. During the past 10 years, the union has too often renounced its own moral principles, providing fuel for nationalist and populist arguments. Europe’s leaders have demonstrated shameful cynicism by constantly prioritising finance and economics over the construction of a genuine “European people”. The management of the 2008 economic crisis in Greece constituted the EU’s first moral failure: by showing its reactionary side, it reduced Europe to a union that was essentially commercial, cold and heartless, embodied by a dominant elite obsessed with profit. Man’s indifference to man seemed to become the norm. The second stage in the EU’s fall came in 2015, with the migrant crisis. The image of those masses of people fleeing poverty and war and coming up against Europe’s haughty indifference left a deep wound in the hearts of many of us. Even today, this continent that sees itself as a lighthouse for the world is, in reality, incapable of fighting against the slavery at its doorstep, the death on its shores, the poverty within its borders.Faced with populists promising simple answers and playing on people’s fears, the EU must cast aside its fear of what it is and boldly proclaim that utopia is possible. It must reduce inequality, improve the democratic process, fight climate change, and welcome refugees fleeing wars and poverty. To be European is to believe that we are, at once, erse and united, that the Other is different but equal. That cultures are not irreconcilable that we are capable of building a dialogue and a friendship by seeking out what we have in common. The universalism of the Enlightenment must be at the heart of the European project.It was probably in Europe that the awareness of what is today called “globalisation” was first forged. Zweig wrote that, after the first world war, the intellectuals of the Old Continent were both enthusiastic and anxious about the fact that the destiny of different peoples was now so closely linked: “Humanity, as it spread across the earth, became more intimately interconnected, and today it is shaken by a fever, the entire cosmos shivering with dread.” European integration was driven by that awareness: the great problems of tomorrow will not be resolved at a national scale. Only by combining our efforts will we find solutions to the challenges of the future, and the best example of this is obviously the planet’s ecological ultimatum.It seems to me that Europe must look southward, with interest, respect and passion. It must look to those shores, too, in order to move on to the next chapter in its history to cease defining itself as an old colonising power, and to find strength in its egalitarian values. To stop wallowing in nostalgia, and instead pour its energy into inventing a better future. Europe must no longer be defined by Christianity or by exclusive, irreconcilable national identities, but must return to the Greek matrix that unites the two sides of mare nostrum. In Greek, the term crisis comes from crineo, which means to choose. That’s where Europe is now: at a crossroads. And our common future will depend on which path we take next, which moral and philosophical choice we make.• Translated from French by Sam Taylor.

However, Encoded’s status as a supplier to the Bank was only revoked following media inquiries in December.The Bank immediately disabled the company’s access to a backup audio feed after the Times revealed the breach and said the company would have no part in future press conferences, calling the sale of access “wholly unacceptable” and saying the feed was “misused”.While no non-public information was revealed, the audio feed potentially allowed unidentified paying customers to hear the Bank governor Mark Carney’s market-moving words at press conferences as much as eight seconds ahead of rivals listening via other means – giving a potentially lucrative advantage.The revelation has dealt a blow to the Bank’s credibility in securing crucial national infrastructure and it faces scrutiny from MPs and an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority. Mel Stride, the chair-elect of parliament’s Treasury select committee, said he expected the MPs to ask “searching questions” of the outgoing governor, Carney, and his replacement, Andrew Bailey, at hearings planned for this week after the ’s reports about the departure of multiple staff.The breach has prompted criticisms of a perceived lack of accountability at the Bank. It has also raised questions about why the potential for press conferences to be targeted in this way was not discussed in regular, confidential discussions between security bosses at the Bank and the European Central Bank, its eurozone counterpart.A person with knowledge of the ECB’s processes said the central bank detected similar targeting of press conferences by companies hoping to give traders an edge as early as two or three years ago, after spotting advertisements published on social media by unnamed companies. The ECB installed its own high-speed audio line in September 2019 in order to give equal access to anyone who wanted it at no cost.However, the Bank said it could find no record of a briefing on any such detections made by the ECB. The ECB declined to comment on its security procedures.Encoded Media is thought to be the supplier to the Bank whose access to the backup audio feed was revoked. Encoded Media’s two directors, Philip Wand and Tom Sillence, are directors of Statisma Group Holdings while also serving as directors of Microlatency. Encoded and Statisma are based in the same office, which was also listed on Microlatency’s website.Microlatency, which was put into liquidation in January 2019, specialised in “ultra-low latency delivery of key live events”, according to an archived version of the website www.microlatency. On the publicly available site, it said: “We use private networks. Not the internet.”The public website said: “We speed up the delivery process. You get to hear the news before others do.”The Times reported that Microlatency was selling access to the audio feed to hedge funds and other investors.Meanwhile, Statisma’s website states that it “started out in 2010 covering public events in the UK, such as Bank of England press conferences and UK parliament sessions”.Statisma’s ads said it allowed users “to hear him first”, according to a post before Mark Carney’s press conference on 7 November.In an emailed statement, Wand said Encoded or Statisma did not hijack audio feeds in any way. He said the companies paid to receive the feed directly from Bloomberg and that it was licensed to use it. He added that previous reports had “already caused economic loss to Encoded Media and Statisma, as well as considerable distress to its directors who run an entirely reputable small technology business with limited resources”.He said: “If we are quicker at delivering content to our clients, it’s only because we have the knowledge and technology to send that content, taken from the Bloomberg feed, to our clients faster than others.“Although we are not the subject of any investigation our preference is not to comment any further until the FCA have completed their inquiries and publish their findings. We are absolutely confident those findings will be that no breach of any law has occurred.”Wand did not comment on Microlatency, yet has consistently denied any sort of wrongdoing committed by Encoded Media linked companies. Sillence did not respond to requests for comment.A Bank spokesman declined to respond to detailed questions about the due diligence process used.

Newsflash: UK factories are also struggling to get their hands on parts from China, just like their eurozone rivals.Supply- chain disruptions across British industry are “rapidly emerging” as the outbreak of COVID-19 led to sizeable raw material delivery delays, rising input costs and increased pressure on stocks of purchases. That’s according to data firm IHS Markit, and its latest survey of UK manufacturing.This PMI survey also found that export business fell again last month, for the fourth month in a row.The effects of the COVID-19 outbreak had a noticeable impact on supply chains during February. Average vendor lead times lengthened to the greatest extent since July 2018, while the eight-point drop in the level of the seasonally adjusted Suppliers’ Delivery Times Index was the largest in the 28-year survey history.Recent storms and flooding in the UK also had an impact.This led to companies “burning through their Brexit safety stocks,” Markit adds. The shortage of raw materials is also pushing up input prices, which is leading to higher prices at the factory gate too.The mood in the City today is much calmer than during last week’s manic sell-off, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.“There is a semi-reversal of last week’s sector trends with healthcare and infrastructure-related stocks no longer in favour and heavily sold-off industrial and mining stocks leading the charge upwards.“The big question is whether a single day’s rebound is enough to repair damaged investor sentiment or if this is simply a dead cat bounce before fears take over again.“It wouldn’t be surprising to see fund managers with spare cash take advantage of the market sell-off and buy companies for a discount.Britain’s City watchdog, the FCA, says it is working closely with the financial services sector to ensure they can keep operating in the face of coronavirus.Reuters has the details:“This is in conjunction with the Bank of England,” an FCA spokesperson said. “As you would expect we have been in contact with a wide range of firms across the sector. We expect all firms to have contingency plans in place to deal with major events so that they are able to continue operating effectively.And, as part of that, to consider how best to support their customers.”Newsflash: Eurozone factories suffered falling exports last month, as the coronavirus outbreak hit demand for goods.Manufacturers have also reported longer delays to get raw materials and parts, due to the ongoing disruption to Chinese supply chains.That’s according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at eurozone factories, from data firm IHS Markit. Factories across Europe suffered “notable” supply-side constraints last month, mainly due to factory shutdowns in China.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says this could hit eurozone growth in the months ahead: “The concern is that coronavirus-related delays in shipments threaten to constrain production in the coming months, prolonging a downturn that already extends to over a year. Supply chains are lengthening to an extent not seen since 2018 and inventories are being depleted at a rate rarely seen over the past decade as companies struggle to produce enough to satisfy order books.“Furthermore, while a return to work for many Chinese factories after the extended New Year holiday could help ease global supply constraints, any further spreading of the COVID-19 epidemic risks driving increased risk aversion and a reduction of spending by both businesses and consumers.” Markit’s eurozone factory PMI came in at 49.2, up from 49.1 last month, a level which shows the sector contracted in February.Every sector of the FTSE 100 index is up this morning, as stocks rebound from last week’s rout:But there are now some fallers, including airlines (AIG and easyJet) and cruise firm Carnival.Newsflash: The Bank of England is promising to take “all necessary steps” to support the UK economy from the impact of coronavirus.“The Bank continues to monitor developments and is assessing its potential impacts on the global and UK economies and financial systems.The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.”So, no firm details of its plans yet.But it does mean the BoE is standing alongside the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve in promising to act where needed.

As part of her Labour leadership campaign, Lisa Nandy, one of the brightest and least entitled Labour politicians of her generation, managed to pull off a remarkable feat – she made a pro-immigration position sound craven.In a frustrating exercise in political hedging, Nandy recently articulated a new position on immigration. She said, or tried to say, all the things that Labour should have been saying for years. That immigration wasn’t the problem, that Labour took too long to make that statement, that never again will there be a “Controls on immigration” slogan printed on a mug. But because it’s now impossible to make those assertions without fear of looking too immigrant-huggy, she ended up couching it all in the boilerplate language of “legitimate concerns”. She apologised for Labour’s failure to understand “why in areas of low immigration, people are concerned about it”. She apologised for a political strategy that made voters feel “irrational or racist”. She pledged that after Brexit showed us that Labour had been “ignoring voters on immigration”, she as leader, “would have the courage to listen”.The result is that we are back where started, apologising for immigration. It’s as if she tried to take two completely opposing positions, then, unable to choose, merged them into one and hoped no one would notice. So which is it? Was Labour too reticent to make a full-throated case for immigration? Or did it err in making voters feel like their concerns weren’t real?I wish it were down to cynicism, to Nandy wanting to appeal to those whom the Tories had won over by successfully fearmongering about immigration, while maintaining Labour’s credentials as the party that stands up for immigrants and minorities. But it is more tragic than that. Nandy is genuinely taking a risk by making such strong pro-immigration noises, by saying the unsayable: that Labour has been complicit, if not instrumental, in passing, or supporting, hostile environment policies, and that this was not only a betrayal of principles, but a tactical mistake. But it seems she cannot express those views without watering them down so much she ends up falling into the same trap that she seeks to avoid – using the language of the right to connect with the base. She cannot – after all the failures, all the losses, all the evidence that the party needs to present a clear policy on immigration that is not just Ed Miliband’s “Tory lite”, or Jeremy Corbyn’s “Tory not” – just say what she believes to be true: the Conservative party ran the country down, and convinced you it was immigration’s fault.Nandy’s strength lies in her conviction and authenticity, the reasons for her rise in the first place. But with every increase in profile her edges are blunted more, her language flattened by platitudes, her demeanour more calculated. With this latest pivot Nandy joins a long line of Labour fantasists, those who believe that they will be able to magically do two opposing things at the same time – legitimise people’s unfounded and xenophobic fears of immigration, while also leading them out of that state into a promised land in one big racism conversion-therapy session. Or harness the positive hopeful power of the left, but distance themselves from its kindness, lest that empathy be taken for weakness.This fear of looking weak is why the opportunity to take on the Conservative party, and the right in general, by presenting a clear counter-narrative is missed again and again. There is already someone “listening” to people on immigration, already a party that has achieved the job of not making people feel irrational or racist for having anti-immigration views. Labour’s task is not to provide more of the same, but to spell out clearly the colossal trick that the right has played on the country, in taking the despair that should be directed at austerity, the gutting of the NHS, the corporatisation and dehumanisation of the state, and saying clearly that immigration has nothing to do with it.Even if we dispense with this truth, the “we hear you but might do nothing about it” approach just doesn’t work. If the point is to win back voters lost to the Tories, those who left because they disliked immigration will hear Nandy’s endorsement of that position, but come polling day will vote for the party they think will actually do something about it. Those who are desperate for Labour to finally take the lead on this topic will hear only Nandy’s apologism. It’s not going to work.It doesn’t take “courage” to listen to voters on immigration. The courageous thing would be to do what Nandy herself says should have been done long ago – stop pretending. There’s a lot of catching up to do. How about starting now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0711a33bf291a886f5b054b79b80220207191264/1083_1288_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca4131324b64a74f8af7a000fb03f48","title":"stop a worry becoming catastrophic how to talk to your kids about the coronavirus","story":"They hear our fears and share them. And they need our help to work it all outI was a the park with my kids a few weekends ago when I heard a group of boys, maybe eight or so years old, talking on the play equipment.“Have you heard about the coronavirus?” asked one as they swung in lazy circles around the spinning wheel.“Do you know how many people have died? Like, 50!”There was murmured agreement that this was indeed a lot of people and then, in the whimsical way of kids, they moved on to another topic.I, on the other hand, was stunned. How did a group of Australian schoolchildren living in a country town half a world away know anything about an outbreak of disease that was, at that time, largely confined to China? And why did they care?The answer is simple of course: they inhabit the same world we do. They hear and see the news, they use social media. They overhear our conversations. And they talk.They care because they hear our fears and they share them. And they need our help to work it all out.There will soon be no avoiding having to talk to your kids about the novel coronavirus, with the Covid-19 outbreak now spreading to every continent of the globe and entering a new, potentially pandemic phase. There are wall-to-wall media coverage, daily updates from our chief medical officer and government, and conversation about the virus is everywhere. It’s inescapable.For many kids, face masks are becoming a familiar sight if you’re in eastern Australia and lived through the summer of hazardous bushfire-related smoke this is even more likely to be the case. Quarantines and lockdowns, transport stoppages, school closures and other major disruptions to routine are already being seen in other countries and may soon become a fact of life here. Family, friends, teachers, even children themselves, may become sick.Parents too often assume that their children are oblivious to world events or are too young to understand what it all means. We don’t want to frighten them by talking to them about it, and that is especially true when we ourselves have a sense of trepidation about what the future holds or aren’t sure what to say.But children, particularly younger ones, think about and process the world in a way that can make them more vulnerable. Concepts of time, place and distance are nebulous. A child can see the same footage of an event over and over, and believe that every instance represents a cumulative threat, with no timeframe for resolution.Unless you explain that the images they are seeing or stories they have heard are, for the moment, from places far away from here, it can seem immediate and frightening. Context, proportion and reassurance are so important.If you seem worried or preoccupied, they will pick up on that and may be afraid to bring it up with you. Dread brings with it shame and embarrassment, and a simple worry can become catastrophic, leading to avoidance, withholding of information and withdrawal, particularly if their questions are dismissed or minimised. Speak the unspeakable.I asked a child psychiatrist, Dr Karen Gaunson, and a children’s media literacy expert, Saffron Howden, for their thoughts on how to talk to kids about the coronavirus outbreak.

But they still refuse to commit to what scientists say is necessary if the US is to rapidly cut back on burning fossil fuels.A recent package of legislation proposed by House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy would encourage capturing climate pollutants from power plants but use them to drill for oil.It would also lead to the planting of a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions but also ramp up logging, an idea Donald Trump has endorsed.The Republican party has seen a pendulum swing. In 2008, its election platform emphasized the importance of cutting emissions. By 2016, Donald Trump ran on a campaign of climate denial.Now at least some prominent Republicans are breaking from the president and veering away from questioning the science and toward efforts that do not directly attack the coal, oil and gas industries. Facing pushback from the far right, on the other side of the aisle they are criticized by some Democrats who believe they are not proposing legislation in good faith.Alex Flint, executive director of the Alliance for Market Solutions – a right-of-center organization that advocates reducing carbon pollution while growing the US economy – said the House bills were “directionally correct” but “need to grow to address the scale of our climate problem”.Flint’s group backs revenue-neutral carbon tax and deregulation.Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican who introduced the trees bill, insisted his proposal would curb emissions even as it promotes logging.When trees are cut down, they stop absorbing carbon. Westerman, a forester who worked for an engineering consulting firm in the timber, pulp and paper business, said forest managers would just plant them again.Products made from the trees would pay for continual planting, he said, and the wood would be used for sustainable buildings with lower emissions footprints.A scientist called to testify by Democrats, Yale ecology professor Carla Staver, strongly disagreed with Westerman’s proposals.Forest management is an important way to fight climate change but it is not enough and it must be done properly, experts agree. A bill from Democrats would aim to conserve forests without increasing logging and by banning oil and gas drilling on public lands if climate emissions exceed targets.Westerman told the  Democrats should be working with Republicans who want to address climate change.“Even someone who’s not a forester should be able to recognize an olive branch when they see one,” he said.Even as Westerman defended his bill, the top Republican on his committee seemed to dismiss the overall effort.At the beginning of the meeting, to which he was late, Rob Bishop of Utah suggested the elevators in House office buildings would be more timely under the rule of Benito Mussolini than they are with Democrats in charge. Democratic climate proposals, he said, offered not a “silver bullet” to fix the problem but “another bullet that is going to be used to shoot ourselves in the foot”.He then showed a graph demonstrating how US heat-trapping emissions have declined over time.While the Republican bills are far from aggressive, the right of the party is pushing back. The conservative Club for Growth Pac painted the package as “stifling liberal environmental taxes, regulations, and subsidies” and vowed to withhold support from any backers.At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference gathering near Washington, the climate change denial group the Heartland Institute presented a German teen activist who calls herself a “climate sceptic” as a foil to Greta Thunberg.In Oregon, Republican state senators fled the state capitol in order to derail a climate change bill.Despite that backdrop, the top Democrat on the House natural resources committee welcomed Westerman’s proposal. Raul Grijalva said he hoped for a “new chapter”, focusing on solutions not denial.“For too long my friends on the other side of aisle denied that this was even a real issue,” he said. “They would reject or even mock the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate is warming humans are responsible and urgent action needs to be taken.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b62f6d5d507dc254acbc6cef4fc0d6ab61df837d/0_210_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0309b8dabb00db8baf5cc39c06430a89","title":"vital cop26 climate talks could be derailed by coronavirus","story":"Preparations for Glasgow summit already hampered by travel restrictionsConcern is growing among campaigners that vital UN climate talks will be derailed by the coronavirus outbreak, while government officials are working to find ways round the problem.This year’s UN talks on the climate are the most important since the Paris agreement in 2015, as the world is now far adrift of the Paris goals and the Cop26 summit – scheduled for Glasgow this November – is seen as one of the last chances to put nations back on track to avoid climate breakdown.But while the talks will take place over a fortnight in November, the frantic round of global diplomacy required to reach a settlement is already under way and is being affected by the outbreak of the virus. Campaigners fear that preparations are being hampered by both the travel restrictionsand the urgent demands the outbreak is putting on governments’ time and resources.China, the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, is the key player in the climate talks. As the US is withdrawing from the Paris accord, whether or not China takes on strong new commitments on carbon will help determine whether Cop26 (the conference of the parties) is a success. But with the coronavirus taking hold across the country, the climate is likely be much less of a priority.Italy also plays a vital role in this year’s talks as the country is officially co-host of Cop26 and some key pre-meetings are planned there.Normally, at this stage before crunch climate talks, officials and politicians from the host nation would be convening meetings in key countries.Campaigners were already concerned that the UK had got off to a slow start, because the first Cop26 president, Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked, and her replacement – the business secretary, Alok Sharma – only appointed two weeks ago. The UK has still not set out a strategy or timetable for Cop26 or for its own goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.Tom Burke, the co-founder of the environmental group E3G and a longtime observer of the talks, said the preparations were already being affected. For the Cop26 talks to succeed “you need to generate much more momentum, you have to have diplomacy that is much more aggressive”, he said. The coronavirus “is already having an impact and if it gets much worse, there will be a more significant impact”.China would be distracted from the talks, predicted Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House and a strategic adviser to the Progressive Policy Institute in the US.“The challenge for the Cop leadership is to act prudently as organisers, while also retaining appropriate attention on the climate emergency itself, which after all is likely to make infectious disease a far bigger problem in much of the world,” he said. “Should coronavirus become a full-scale pandemic, holding anything like a traditional Cop might quickly become impossible.”Nat Keohane, a senior vice-president of the US Environmental Defense Fund, said a key meeting in Bonn, Germany, in early June could be hit, and bilateral meetings between the UK, the EU and other key players might also be affected.However, people with experience of the talks also said the UK and the UN would take advantage of communications technology to carry on with diplomatic preparations. At the Paris talks, negotiators held regular confabs on Facebook and other forms of social media, and have active WhatsApp groups. Videoconferencing is also increasingly used.These technologies have the advantages of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from travel. Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, said using virtual meetings could be “an unintended benefit”.The Cabinet Office, which is leading on Cop26 for the UK government, said: “The summit is still many months away but we’re monitoring the situation closely. Our officials are attending all planned engagements. But we are aware that this is an issue which may affect some international travel and will adapt our plans accordingly, to ensure necessary discussions and diplomacy with international partners can continue.”The European commission said there had been “no significant impact for the time being” on Cop26 preparations but the EU and China were “maintaining contacts via videoconferencing and through diplomatic channels at various levels. We are still hopeful and committed to the summits foreseen this year and will work closely with the Chinese government to this effect.” Travel is also continuing to unaffected areas around the world.Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a developing world thinktank, contrasted the rapid global response to the virus with sluggish attempts to stave off climate breakdown. “The response to Covid-19 has been drastic and urgent, as it should be,” he said. “The fact they can act this decisively to stop the Covid-19 crisis exposes their slow reaction to the climate crisis is not one of capacity, but a lack of political will.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff2b6113f5ae74263f22a9a828ed52fdcd34885a/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=509d2f7e9986d4605014feec1dd02f4d","title":"tell us have you not bought clothes for more than 10 years","story":"We’re interested in hearing from people who haven’t bought any clothes for the last 10 years Konnie Huq has revealed that she hasn’t bought any clothes in 10 years.

From the coves of Cornwall to the suburbs of Glasgow, inspirational choirs and angel-voiced ordinary folk are just waiting to be discovered and made into a movie. Not content with mining our pop heritage (Rocketman, Bohemian Rhapsody, etc), British cinema has set up a production line in everyday tales of the power of song, often claiming to be “inspired by a true story”, which might not be quite accurate.Military Wives is both the latest example, and an illustration of why this stuff is so prevalent. The true story in question is well known: how the partners of British servicemen fighting in Afghanistan formed a choir that became a national sensation. It is perfectly enjoyable, and the premise is beyond reproach, but we know how this tune goes: unpromising beginnings, a cappella pop hits, a chalk-and-cheese character clash (Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan), preparations for the Big Concert, and the obligatory angel-voiced introvert among them who never knew she had it in her.In the past few years we have had myriad variations on this theme. Such as Fisherman’s Friends, based on the real-life Cornish choir whose sea shanties became a surprise hit. We have had Jessie Buckley as a single mum following her country-singing dream in Wild Rose. For the seniors, we have had Song for Marion, with Gemma Arterton coaxing Ace of Spades out of her seniors choir. And, for the younger demographic, Teen Spirit, with Ellie Fanning as a glum Polish immigrant whose talent takes her into the final stages of an X Factor-like competition. The latter gives you some indication of where this is all coming from. Rather than reality, these movies are increasingly based on reality TV, which has already prepackaged the feelgood story for us.The popularity of shows such as Britain’s Got Talent, X Factor and Gareth Malone’s The Choir (which itself owes a debt to 2004 French hit The Chorus) has belatedly dawned on British cinema, just when the shows themselves are falling out of favour. Sometimes, cinema transcribes these tales directly: James Corden played BGT-winner Paul Potts in One Chance a Susan Boyle biopic is still on the cards with Meryl Streep rumoured to fancy the role. Other times, the movies massage the truth somewhat. In real life, the Military Wives benefited considerably from the input of Gareth Malone, who marshalled them into a chart-topping phenomenon and chronicled the whole process in his TV series. But Malone is tidily airbrushed out of the movie, as is composer Paul Mealor, leaving the impression of a grass-roots human tale when in fact this is more like a cover version of one. The reality is often rougher and messier, but also more interesting.

Through the rain they watched as Vinícius Júnior scored the goal that changed everything: a night, that had begun nervously, and perhaps the destination of the title race too. For almost an hour they had suffered, as if awaiting the inevitable against a side seemingly sure of its superiority, but now they celebrated. At the end Marcelo slipped to his knees and the arena leapt to its feet, symbolic of what this meant.The reaction after that first hour began with a shot from Isco, flying just over via Marc-André ter Stegen’s glove, before Vinícius gave Madrid a lead that Mariano Díaz doubled on the final whistle, as if to underline how fast things can change and Zinedine Zidane’s seemingly superhuman ability to revive footballers. Mariano had not played a single minute this season and had been on the pitch only 30 seconds but now he scored.Madrid had been on edge, Barça presented with the chance to tip them over and into the abyss, virtually ending their hopes of winning the league days after Manchester City had seemed to do the same in Europe. Perhaps that, too, will feel different now. Madrid are back on top and suddenly infused with life, electricity running through them.Barcelona had flatlined, their plan failing. They had appeared in control, rarely troubled, but when Madrid rebelled and this place burst into life they could not live with it. Unexpectedly they were overrun, the way the game and their world had been turned upside down expressed in the moment, with five minutes to go, that Lionel Messi took down Casemiro. It spoke of frustration: Messi had been stopped brilliantly by the Brazilian. He had also passed up two great chances and by then knew defeat was coming. What no one imagined then was that it would be by two goals. It hurt enough already.Quique Setién had said Barcelona would seek to dominate possession and that this game was more important for Madrid, two points behind at the top and in what Zidane had described as a “delicate position”. His team appeared to be playing with that – as if Barcelona had time, content for Madrid to feel the pressure build, the need to win drawing them into decisions that could cost them. Ultimately though, the clock worked against Barcelona, not Madrid – a team you should never leave alive.Isco had won a corner after 53 seconds but that immediately gave way to a two-minute long period of Barcelona possession which was an early indication of the way things would be. Slowly Barcelona took control – and slowly was often the word, playing up and playing back again, hold and wait, pass and then pass some more. The control was theirs and opportunities would eventually be, until it suddenly slipped away from them in the second half.Up until the opening goal Vinícius had dashed often but decided poorly, Madrid able to create little, quick but lacking clarity. Barcelona dominated but the chances which eventually arrived were wasted. Antoine Griezmann shot over, set up by Jordi Alba and Messi. Arturo Vidal was sent through but he gave the ball up for Griezmann who did the same for Messi, and his snapshot was saved easily. Then suddenly Arthur went clean through, outrunning Toni Kroos – not the fastest of foot races – only to be denied by Thibaut Courtois. And soon afterwards Sergio Busquets’ wonderful clipped ball left Messi alone. He brought it down and, as it bounced back up, sidefooted goalwards. Again Courtois saved.When the game changed, it came from, of all things, a short corner from which Isco drew a fabulous save from Ter Stegen. This place and this team, which had mostly watched the game go by, appeared awakened. Piqué had to scramble Isco’s header off the line and Karim Benzema volleyed just over as Barcelona lost their grip and the ball, the momentum Madrid’s and the noise rising.Soon it was off the scale. Kroos slipped the ball through for Vinícius, running into the area. Piqué stood off, not advancing until it was too late. Perhaps he was waiting for Vinícius to make the mistake for him. Instead he did, the Brazilian’s shot going in at the near post off his leg.The roar then was matched by the one that greeted Marcelo and Raphaël Varane cutting off Messi when he ran through. Marcelo punched the air and roared. They all did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60617ddfb0e125defadd721217cab7ce7a7ff302/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea1eba3353655647736982cff02bce7","title":"premier league clasico carabao cup weekend talking points","story":"Underrated Pearson has transformed Watford, Wolves’ unsung hero comes to fore and Messi and Griezmann just don’t clickLong tipped as the future of Manchester City, Phil Foden has been a largely peripheral figure in their glittering present. A regular in early cup rounds, he had played only one minute across City’s two previous League Cup finals. His selection ahead of Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez on Sunday felt significant, and was just reward for a player who has seized the opportunities he has been given. Foden played the full 90 minutes and was the game’s outstanding performer, setting up Sergio Agüero’s opener with an instinctive header back across goal. It is no mean feat to slot into Pep Guardiola’s team, surrounded by big names playing to a metronomic rhythm. To look like he belongs, as he did at Wembley, shows a mental fortitude to match his immense natural ability. Foden has had to balance patience and self-belief to avoid getting lost in the Manchester City machine now he is set to become a crucial cog. Niall McVeighThe first thing to understand about a frantic finish at Goodison is that it was not merely another VAR controversy. Because Gylfi Sigurdsson was clearly offside the Harry Maguire deflection that beat David de Gea was checked and, though the verdict that the Everton player was interfering aggrieved the home side, it was a reasonable conclusion to draw even if the goalkeeper was never going to reach the ball. The VAR story was moved on a little though, for the reason the whole stadium was booing at the end was not just Carlo Ancelotti’s red card but because the whole incident had just been replayed on the big screen. Spectators do not normally get to view disputed footage, but someone must have decided the paying customers deserved to see what Stockley Park officials and an armchair television audience were seeing. About time, too. This might just be the future. Paul WilsonIt did not take long to get to the heart of Frank Lampard’s irritations after Marcos Alonso got Chelsea out of jail at Bournemouth. Lampard criticised his players’ game management after conceding two goals in three second‑half minutes and acknowledged there is significant room for improvement on Tuesday night against Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round after Eddie Howe’s side exposed a recurring soft centre. Ruben Loftus-Cheek could step up his comeback with the under-23s on Monday and Callum Hudson‑Odoi is expected to return against Everton on Sunday but, in the meantime, Chelsea have defensive frailties to remedy. “Every game is different but you have to have a mindset within the group on the pitch,” Lampard said. “Sometimes you have to dig in and concentrate that little bit more as a group – that we have been tested with a lot. We have talked about it a lot. The players have to find that solution on the pitch.” Ben FisherLeicester need a fit and firing Jamie Vardy in double-quick time if their season is not to turn from outstanding to merely very good. Vardy missed the flat defeat at Carrow Road with a calf injury and has struggled with a series of niggles since Christmas. “It is a concern,” Brendan Rodgers said. “We’ve spoken about that with him and the medical team.” Rodgers hopes he will be back to face Aston Villa on 9 March, with Kelechi Iheanacho not the most convincing of deputies. In the short term Vardy is required to see Leicester over the line to the Champions League spots but his recent spate of absences may have longer-term implications: his injury record in recent years has been exemplary, but he has just turned 33 and cannot go at full tilt for ever. How Rodgers can address that reality in the summer may depend on where Leicester finish. Nick AmesIf we were not already, it is probably time to bracket Diogo Jota among the best and most intelligent all‑round forwards in England. His goal at Spurs was his sixth in three games but his all-round display, culminating in a marvellous run to set up Raúl Jiménez’s winner, was exceptional and the 23-year-old just keeps getting better. Jota is quick, difficult to knock off the ball and deft when releasing it – and on Sunday he also posed a threat in the air, a leap and flex of the neck muscles producing a header that almost flew in after half-time. Jiménez and Adama Traoré have taken most of Wolves’ headlines, and the former looked typically imperious in their latest win, but Jota belongs in that company too. Nuno Espírito Santo demands extreme tactical rigour from his front men in order that their flourishes have foundation Jota fits the bill in both senses. Nick Ames• Match report: Tottenham 2-3 WolvesEntering the final straight of the season with Premier League survival still in doubt is a familiar feeling for Glenn Murray. The veteran striker has been through his fair share of relegation battles since being promoted to the top flight in 2013 with Crystal Palace before moving to Bournemouth and then back to Brighton. But despite this damaging home defeat against their arch rivals on Saturday – a result that left Graham Potter’s side sitting precariously above the drop zone by one point – the 36-year-old knows they must end a run of just one win from their past 18 Premier League fixtures soon to avoid being dragged under. “It’s nothing new to us,” Murray said. “We don’t think we are better than this. We aim to improve all the time but this is the scenario we are in and we’ve got to deal with it.” Ed AaronsBurnley’s Chris Wood has scored 10 goals in 25 league appearances this season. The New Zealand striker began on the bench but made a big difference once he stepped off it, worrying Steve Bruce’s experimental back four. Wood’s movement and ability to make his physical presence felt prompted memories of Bruce’s predecessor, Rafael Benítez, regularly extolling his virtues. Considering Wood would probably have cost around half the £40m Newcastle invested in Joelinton – the scorer of one goal in 28 league games – it would surely have been worth Bruce trying to buy him last summer. But such an attempt would have been vetoed Wood is 28 and Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, has a policy of buying only players younger than 25 with high resale potential. Should the club suffer a third relegation on Ashley’s watch that will look like a shockingly false economy. Louise TaylorWhile the focus was on West Ham’s forwards after their 3-1 win over Southampton, David Moyes still wants more balance between defence and attack. West Ham have not kept a clean sheet in the league since 1 January and Moyes knows better defending will increase his side’s survival hopes. “If you are going to lose lots of goals you will always be in trouble,” he said. “If we want really good attacking players we have to have good defenders.” There were some encouraging signs against Southampton. Issa Diop and Angela Ogbonna impressed in central defence, while Jeremy Ngakia had another promising game at right-back. “I am working with them,” Moyes said. “Diop has incredible potential but he also has the mistakes of a young centre-half that we have seen over recent weeks. I have a 19-year-old right‑back playing his third game. We have to make sure we are strong defensively.” Jacob SteinbergThe list of stars who have faded in the wake of Lionel Messi at Barcelona is long and illustrious. Cesc Fàbregas, Thierry Henry, Alexis Sánchez and Zlatan Ibrahimovic come readily to mind. With Luis Suárez and Ousmane Dembélé long-term absentees, Antoine Griezmann is adapting to the role of superdomestique assistant to the master. The evidence of Sunday’s defeat at the Bernabéu is that the Frenchman and Argentinian do not operate on the same wavelength. Griezmann’s early glaring miss from from Jordi Alba’s pass – a favourite Messi supply line – passed up a golden chance to buy himself some credibility with doubtful Barça fans. Griezmann is unfortunate not to be playing with the peak Messi of the Pep Guardiola years, a player prepared to exert himself, and so must link with someone who flits in and out. And that makes establishing a connection even more difficult.

But a lot of what would fall under that banner dates back centuries and has its roots in Europe, not California.“There is a unique wellness culture in Europe,” says Beth McGroarty, the director of research at the Global Wellness Institute, a US nonprofit group. It dates as far back as Roman spas and the ancient Greek focus on preventing sickness, not merely treating it. “Europe has its own ancient medical thinking and wellness traditions and we don’t seem to pay any attention to them.”The continent is also home to some of the happiest, healthiest countries in the world, although the UK doesn’t trouble the top 10. So, what can we learn from European wellness practices and traditions?The siesta, a short afternoon nap, is believed to have evolved in Spain to allow farmers time to rest during the hottest hours of the day. The tradition persists in the country, with work hours extending later to accommodate the break.A large study in 2007 found that heart diseases were less prevalent among people who regularly took a 30-minute nap, while research in 2010 discovered that an afternoon snooze could improve the brain’s ability to learn.“Even just slowing down for a short period of time allows you to disconnect from the world and subsequently boost energy, focus and creativity,” says Paul Joseph, the founder of the travel company Health and Fitness Travel.Iceland consistently ranks highly in metrics such as life expectancy and blood pressure, placing third in Bloomberg’s 2019 healthiest country index, behind Spain and Italy.The Nordic diet shares some similarities with the life-extending Mediterranean diet, although it is lower in fruit and vegetables, advocating moderate consumption of fat and protein along with canola oil (a type of rapeseed oil), wild berries and root vegetables.A diet high in fresh fish, and therefore omega-3 fatty acids, is considered key to a healthy diet in Iceland. Haddock, herring and cod – including the cheeks and tongues, the most prized parts – are all dietary staples. Fermented shark is a national dish.It is also common for Icelanders to take a daily supplement of cod-liver oil during the winter months, when it is difficult to get enough vitamin D from sunlight alone. The benefits of fish oil and omega-3 are contested, but their proponents say they relieve joint stiffness associated with arthritis and improve the condition of teeth, nails, hair and skin.Although the use of mud as a beauty treatment was documented in ancient Egypt, with clay from the banks of the Nile being applied to the face and skin to improve appearance and texture, it was popularised in Italy during Roman times – “fango” is Italian for “mud”.From there, fangotherapy spread with the Roman empire mud treatments and wraps remain a common spa treatment across Europe and further afield.While different types of mud (mixed with mineral or thermal water) are said to have different properties, fangotherapy is most effective as a gentle cleansing treatment and has relaxing, anti-stress effects. These should not be sniffed at: chronic stress affects the immune system and causes high blood pressure, fatigue, poor mental health and even heart disease.Is there anything the Mediterranean diet can’t do? It draws together common food types and healthy habits from several southern European countries, including Greece, Spain, southern France, Portugal and Italy. As such, there is no single definition, but it is typically high in fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, olive oil and unsaturated fats, with moderate dairy intake.Its benefits have been found to be remarkably wide-ranging: it has been associated with longer life expectancy, a healthier gut, better heart health, protection from disease, lower risk of depression, diabetes prevention and alleviation – and even improved athletic performance.Sauna culture exists across Europe, but it is deeply ingrained in Finland, where there is one facility for about every two people, the Finnish Sauna Society says. The traditional experience is to push yourself to your limit in a communal sauna with a very high temperature, then to immerse yourself in cold water or snow – and repeat.The cold experience is “crucial”, says McGroarty, with the contrast between hot and cold thought to bring health benefits. She says: “It seems to have a strong impact on cardiovascular health.”This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. Scientific studies have found that the effectiveness of this “contrast therapy” (such as for treating athletes’ injuries) is questionable, but the physiological effects are such that it persists regardless. As no one knows better than the Finns, it feels good to be really hot, then really cold. As such, icy plunge pools and snow rooms are popular as a chaser to heated or humid experiences at spas worldwide.Sophrology, a practice of “dynamic relaxation”, was developed by a Colombian neuropsychiatrist in the 60s, but it took root in France and Switzerland, where it remains wildly popular.It combines eastern and western influences, meditation, breathing techniques, gentle movement, positive psychology and visualisation to give a sense of being calm and in control.Although the practice is said to be more dynamic than mindfulness, it has similar benefits, and is said to be helpful in stress management, self-development, preparing for public speaking or even childbirth. French studies have recorded positive effects in helping cancer patients to manage their anxiety, stress and fear.In the UK, sophrology is taught at clinics in London for about £100 an hour. In France and Switzerland, it is widely covered by health insurance, used by corporate high-flyers and professional athletes (including, reportedly, the French national rugby team) and taught in schools and hospitals.It is gemütlich in German and gezelligheid in Dutch in English, you might say “smelly candles”. But it was the parallel Danish concept of hygge that launched a global lifestyle phenomenon in 2016, with concerted cosiness the suggested solution to a turbulent year of Brexit and Donald Trump.“Hygge relates to a level of cosiness and conviviality that incites a feeling of wellbeing,” says Joseph. “The core of the practice is to live in the everyday moment and appreciate everything around you – streaming the ideas of eastern mindfulness.”There is no easy English translation, but the Dutch word uitwaaien refers to spending time in wild, windy weather – usually by going for a walk or a bike ride. By replacing “bad air” with “good air”, it is believed to leave you feeling clear-headed and refreshed.“It feels exhilarating – wind is distracting, so it’s sort of meditative, in the sense you cannot think about anything else,” says McGroarty.Many northern European countries have an equivalent of the Japanese term shinrin-yoku (“forest bathing”), which refers to the restorative effects of spending time in woodland or parks.Time spent outdoors in any capacity has recorded benefits, such as increasing vitamin D levels, improving mood and focus, encouraging incidental exercise and possibly reducing pain. A 2018 study found that exposure to green space can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, premature death, pre-term birth, stress and high blood pressure. Even as little as two hours a week may have an effect.Comparable to the western coffee break, fika is another simple Scandinavian wellness philosophy that involves slowing down to prioritise social interaction. “It is a meal or a meeting allowing for social interaction and stronger relationship bonds, increasing feelings of positivity, calm and creativity,” says Joseph.The meeting can happen at any time of day – and “preferably several times a day”, advises the Swedish government. Although baked goods or sweets are often served, the key purpose is the social interaction.Building a social component into exercise, by taking a fitness class or working out with a friend, has been shown to increase motivation and accountability and even improve performance. A University of Aberdeen study in 2016 found that people exercised more when they did so with a friend, due to the emotional support.The concept of “wellness tourism”, valued by Bloomberg at $639bn, began in Europe centuries ago, says McGroarty. She points to the 200-year-old German tradition of the kur: “a commitment to taking a longer break” for the purpose of wellness.From the late 18th century until the second world war, it was common to retire to a sanatorium or a spa for a weeks- or months-long programme of rest, fresh air, bathing and steam. McGroarty likens the best-known of these destinations – Baden-Baden and Bad Ems in Germany, Bad Gastein and Bad Ischl in Austria, Bath in the UK – to “our Las Vegas of health: the places to be and to be seen”. Composers and authors would go there to work, while others would go to recover from or avoid illness.Even today, a two- or three-week-long kur can be prescribed and even paid for through the German (and Austrian) healthcare system, in recognition of the fact that healthy, rested workers are more productive.The idea of taking a longer break just to be well is at odds with the modern fashion for shorter, high-impact holidays – but “the pendulum will need to swing back”, says McGroarty. She predicts a trend for “wellness sabbaticals”, as people retreat for longer to recover from the busy world.

To eschew dos, drinks things, screenings, soirees and shindigs. It might have been the time, at a fancy dress party, that I found myself telling a complete stranger how, when I was wearing a costume like theirs, I wet myself after underestimating the time to take off the outfit. (A straitjacket, if you’re interested.)Or it might have been the time I actually wet myself.That, of course, is not to be confused with the time, at another party, that I threw up in a sink, before realising that the host had just prepared a fresh bowl of punch in said sink. As I said at the time, it was a dumb place to leave a bowl of punch even temporarily, but I was never going to win that argument – or the subsequent kerfuffle in which I argued that if either of us should leave, it should really be him.It might even have been a time when there weren’t body fluids involved but famous folk instead: Julianna Margulies in New York, Andrew Lloyd Webber in Belgravia, the Queen at Holyrood Palace. (You’re not allowed to touch the Queen, apparently.)Or it could have been one of the countless occasions at which there were merely embarrassments and humiliations (major, minor and imagined) that were endured as I thought I ought to enjoy parties and maybe I wasn’t making enough of an effort to be effervescent. Or it might have been one of the times – inevitable at my age – when I’ve walked into a party to be greeted by an ex, or worse still, an ex and their new partner. Being gregarious or egregious may feel like particularly effective defence mechanisms in the moment, but those times when I thought I was hiding my damage? It was the only thing that others could see, probably visible from space.So, after one particular fete worse than death, I stopped going to parties. No more plucking prosecco off silver salvers, spilling little bowls of risotto down myself andor soap stars, playing informal but high-stakes games of hide and seek with people who, for reasons all too easy to fathom, didn’t like me very much. Enough was enough.On the rare occasion that I actually get invited to things these days, I usually decline. Now, the nicest time I can imagine is sitting on the sofa with a friend, eating pizza and watching Star Trek: Discovery (again) or the Ustinov version of Evil Under the Sun (again). I was reflecting on all this recently at a party. A really swanky annual event, always in a lux London hotel and seriously star-studded. I’ve been several times but this year, probably for the first time, I really enjoyed myself. I did not think this was possible at a party. And yet there I was. This is no reflection on the occasion’s previous iterations – objectively, it is one of the best parties you could go to – but there was something different this year. Obviously I couldn’t just feel happy and sense enjoyment and not analyse why. What was different? What had changed? That would be me.The main difference was that I wasn’t trying to have fun. I spent the evening talking to people I like – people I love – and having interesting, engaging chats with people I barely knew. I wasn’t in pursuit of validation from strangers. I didn’t need to put others down to make myself feel better because I felt fine. Fundamentally, my motivations for going to the party were different. For me, if my motivation is wrong, whatever I end up doing is contaminated by that. Fruit from the poisonous tree, so to speak.Also, I don’t drink any more. All of this means that now, I’m something I rarely was: I was present. I still find it tricky but like everything worthwhile, it takes practice. And here is the thing that is crucial to me: I don’t think of it as a change that I made, but one that is happening.Now I look back at previous parties and I can make light of them, package them as anecdotes, so they can sound almost harmless, my trials trivial. But at the time, they were awful. Feeling like an alien in a person suit is not a nice way to be. It’s lonely, relentless and exhausting – and blimey, I was angry. I still feel like that sometimes, but not as much as I used to. I hold on to the new me, who only goes to parties for the right reason. Because, for me, change is a process and not an event. Which is just as well, seeing as events and I aren’t great mixers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc97e9eaac7346adfbfffde0f08d2eff2bf22c3/0_225_6704_4023/master/6704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9cb329efe0b25109602968e5ff9b4e0","title":"laughter therapy there is nothing funnier than people in stretchy pants with their bums in the air","story":"Gymbox calls itself “the antidote to boring gyms”, and busts a nut to prove it. Its timetable includes a white-collar fight club, sword play training, exercises for “cavemen and neandergals” and a class called Death Row, which sounds as much fun as long ision. Most chilling of all, though, is the prospect of laughing therapy. Is there anything worse than forced fun? I have a very sophisticated sense of humour. I like Renaissance comedy. I appreciate subversion of form, meta-textuality. The prospect of Gymbox telling me what is funny is deeply painful, yet a strangely logical culmination of this column: like a Turner prize judge forced to assess their own child’s drawing of a dog, painted by numbers.And so I find myself at a class in south London, with about 12 others, plus a worryingly bubbly instructor. We start gently, lying on the floor and recalling a funny memory. Immediately I’m in trouble. I second guess my choice, try to find something better and come up blank. Everyone is moving on, warming up their laughs, chuckling then guffawing. I’m faking it, full of anxiety. Not only is it dawning on me that nothing funny has ever happened to me in my life, I also look out of place. I have a photographer with me, which is probably ruining the experience for others. I’m the only man here, and feel as if I’ve clodded into a female space. I’m wearing a Christmas T-shirt that reads: “Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-llama”, because I didn’t have anything else clean.I start to do better once the emphasis isn’t on laughter. There is a freestyle dance section, which is much more my thing. There is a bit where we move like chimps, which is very satisfying. There is a lot of downward dog, which gets me sweating and out of my head. Essentially this is a light yoga class, interspersed with group work and laughter exercises. It all hangs together because of the instructor, sly and mischievous, not like any yoga teacher I’ve ever had.It is odd that the world of wellness is mostly a po-faced one. Because the phenomenon of laughter should be a trump card in the industry’s semi-defiant, semi-craven relationship with science. While studies indicate a strong link between laughter and the release of endorphins, decreased cortisol, muscle relaxation and cardiovascular health, the exact mechanisms of this are little understood. The evidence is wide, not deep, yet laughter hurdles the need for data-driven proof. The benefits of a good laugh are physiological, mental, psychosocial, even spiritual. Whether the purpose of a punchline is to de-escalate negative emotions, reinforce tribe bonds or expose the paradoxes of our given reality, research papers are redundant. We know laughter is crucial to our flourishing, because … we just do.Back at Gymbox, things look pretty serious, for about 20 seconds. The class is lined up before a mirrored wall, attempting to laugh without smiling. I cackle mirthlessly, staring at my dead eyes and feeling like Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker. Unlike the film, this is pretty funny. Why so serious? There is a canny insight at the heart of this class – that we laugh harder when we know we’re not supposed to. Let’s call the effect the Funeral Giggles, because it sounds like a garage band the Joker might have played in if he had learned to lighten up.“Remember, if you wobble, you put the rest of the class off,” the instructor admonishes us, twinkle in her eye, as we practise one-footed balances. When she instructs us to shuffle backwards on the floor with our legs held aloft, I finally succumb. I get why this is a yoga class now. Yoga is funny. It is people in stretchy pants with their bums in the air, strenuously attempting to be at peace two doors down from a kebab shop. It is such a relief to let go of the usual anxieties of this situation, inhibitions about my ungainliness, lack of flexibility and ability to sweat from the elbows. They are the whole point here. I roll backwards like a purple-faced plum, over and over, buttocks to heaven, shrieking with involuntary cackles.I end the hour-long class with a goofy grin on my stupid face, feeling warm toward the strangers around me, oozing benediction like a pope on grappa. I’m loose and open. The physical workout has been relatively slight, but mentally I’ve been overhauled. That’s a ratio to love. I have also realised I like drawings of dogs, I don’t actually like Renaissance comedy, and I need to wash my clothes more often. Which is three more breakthroughs than I have had in actual therapy.Apparently, fake laughter triggers the same physical effects as real. Which is oddly disturbing, isn’t it?Penicillin is the best medicine, FYI. 45"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef075af09fe34165e5f04dde41cc869693c84f46/76_0_5540_3324/master/5540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0a890f13a9f414e23c9eab43abbf61f","title":"i cant afford a flat in london even though ive saved a deposit","story":"I’ve lived in Wanstead all my life and my hopes were raised by an ‘affordable’ developmentQ Since graduation from art college in 2009, I’ve been able to live at home rent free so despite being on a lowish salary of £20,000 as a trainee teaching assistant, I have managed to save a total of £35,000.

The flats will be priced at £275,000 in an area where flats are normally priced at upwards of £300,000.

I live in London. She saw there were many stores on its website in London, and that it was also valid online.I finally got round to using it in January, and went into its store near Charing Cross. But I was told that because it was a franchise, or authorised seller and not a full store, I could not use it there. They advised only “grey gift cards” could be used. I checked online, and found that means the number of stores in London where I can use it goes from 29 to two: Carnaby Street and Regent Street.The Carnaby Street shop is tiny, with minimal stock, while Regent Street also doesn’t have many of the items listed on the website, and is more expensive than online.I therefore decided to buy something from its website, but when I tried to enter the code, it said it was invalid. Customer services confirmed that “our gift cards can be used only in physical stores”.

We recognise this can cause confusion for consumers, so from late summer all The North Face vouchers will be redeemable in flagship stores and on TNF.“We’ve apologised for the inconvenience and offered the consumer the chance to switch his gift card to an e-voucher to allow them to purchase items online.”We’re glad to hear The North Face is changing its policy, though we are scratching our heads to understand why this isn’t until late summer.

I know from my own tortuous experiences, both with and without treatment, that it is extremely hard to get help, and there is too little money in the system to provide enough care.But I also know it is possible to get help and to recover. Hope is crucial for those with eating disorders, as well as carers and health professionals. The aim of eating disorders awareness week, which runs from 2-8 March, is to break down stigma, help more people understand these disorders and bring hope about recovery.Is this realistic? Speaking to patients, carers and clinicians, I am struck by the sheer desperation of so many people saying the system has failed them. Too many find that nothing is done until they are at death’s door. Others say no one talks about binge-eating disorder, which is still too often seen as a weakness or a problem that dieting can fix, rather than a real eating disorder.Clinicians, too, paint a gloomy picture of the state of services. Oxford-based eating disorder consultant Agnes Ayton, who chairs the faculty of eating disorders at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, is frank about the problems. She believes NHS eating disorder services are on their knees and desperately need more money after years of austerity. Staff are still committed to providing quality care, as I know well: I recovered from my own long-standing eating disorder in Oxford, having been failed by the system in other services. But Ayton’s service for outpatients, like many others, is contracted by the local clinical commissioning group to treat people with moderate or severe eating disorders, and is technically unable to treat patients deemed to have either mild or extreme disorders. Ayton believes making this distinction is unworkable and unethical, and is concerned that it stems from a lack of understanding about the nature of eating disorders.Tim Kendall, who directs clinical investment policy for eating disorders and mental health for NHS England (NHSE), says funding is being focused on community services rather than specialist eating disorder beds. Managing eating disorder illnesses through community care, in his clinical view, enables earlier intervention and reduces need for hospital beds.The problem is that this categorises hospital-based care as only for people with very serious physical health problems who need admitting to a general ward because of the severity of their disorder, when inpatient treatment should be about more than just restoring physical health.Kendall is keen to build on what he sees as the success of new investment in treatment for children and young people, to transform treatments for adult eating disorders. This falls within a larger framework of community mental health services being developed for adults. Almost £1bn more each year has been promised for community mental health services for adults as part of the NHS long term plan. So far, 12 sites have received more than £70m to pilot new integrated models of primary and community mental health. Of those, eight are implementing innovative new outpatient schemes to improve access and quality services for adults with eating disorders.While it’s good to have £1bn allocated to mental health services, I worry that this could pit eating disorder services against other mental illnesses, particularly as the long term plan includes no significant investment for adult eating disorder services in the next two years.Kendall says the new scheme includes what he describes as significant investment for eating disorders, and that two two of the pilot sites are for inpatient treatment of eating disorders. All the pilots will be monitored to see what works best. Importantly, Kendall says the rule for new services will be that they “open the doors”, rather than wait for people to be at their worst before being able to access mental health care.There are some encouraging signs. In West Yorkshire and Harrogate, consultant psychiatrist William Rhys Jones, who works for the Connect community and inpatient eating disorders service, says he is seeing real change. Connect’s community outreach teams deliver home-based treatment for people with severe and enduring eating disorders.This is one of the NHSE new care models and Jones says results so far have been very positive. Clinical community services and early intervention result in a good prognosis, he says – and it is cost effective. While inpatient treatment costs about £434 a day, community treatment costs about £20 to £35 a day, with similar or even improved clinical outcomes.While there are concerns about limiting inpatient treatment and prioritising community treatment simply because it may be cheaper, positive examples like this can help hold the NHS to its promise to make treatment truly open to all who need it.• Lorna Collins is a peer support worker, artist and writer.

The games have not been behind a paywall for two decades.The Six Nations chief executive officer, Benjamin Morel, said a report that a decision had been taken to move all the matches off free-to-air TV was “highly premature” but the door has been left open to such an outcome.The Rugby Paper said Sky Sports had become favourites to land a deal worth £300m and bring the Six Nations off terrestrial television “until 2024 at the earliest”.The BBC and ITV combined to outbid Sky when the last TV deal was negotiated, securing a deal said to be worth £90m. Six Nations matches have been on terrestrial television since England’s home games were shown exclusively on Sky from 1997 to 2000.However, no joint bids are being allowed in the next round of negotiations.“By ruling out any joint bids it’s almost as if the Six Nations are clearing the way for Sky,” the Rugby Paper quotes an industry source as saying. “There is a very real danger that they will be prepared to sacrifice the big audiences on BBC and ITV for more money.”In response on Sunday a Six Nations spokesperson was quoted as saying: “Six Nations are in the process of seeking bids for various sets of media rights but these are not due for some time.“All of this is highly premature and speculative as no proposals have yet been received by any interested party.

That was the good news for Australia. The very bad was that star all-rounder Ellyse Perry is likely out of the tournament after leaving the field late in the game with an apparent hamstring strain, after already nursing shoulder and hip complaints.The virtual quarter-final at Melbourne’s Junction Oval was not quite as close as the scorecard suggests: 155-5 next to 151-7. The Kiwis were out of the chase when they needed 15 runs from the final two deliveries, at which point Katey Martin hit a four and a six that couldn’t change the result. Her closing contribution was 37 from 15 balls.But New Zealand had been behind the asking rate all day, with Australia’s leg-spinner Georgia Wareham and swing bowler Megan Schutt making timely interventions in the latter half of the innings, after Kiwi captain Sophie Devine had started it far short of her best.Devine is known in Australia for her devastating innings in the Big Bash League, where in five seasons she has battered over two thousand runs and bombed the grass banks and grandstands with a frankly obscene 88 sixes. After an underwhelming World Cup, though, when the stakes were high, Devine battled to 31 from 36 deliveries, facing 16 dot balls before the one that got her out.Her partner Rachel Priest initially covered the shortfall, clubbing three early boundaries to push the score to 25, but as happens so often the Australians were able to trip up a partnership using Jess Jonassen. The left-arm spinner did what she always does, bowling a suffocating line on the stumps and straightening the ball from round the wicket: we haven’t seen a Priest trapped so squarely since Thomas Becket.With Devine joined by Suzie Bates, New Zealand’s two best strikers were at the crease, but they couldn’t get the run rate up around the eight or nine per over that would have kept the pressure low. A combination of Wareham’s slider and Alyssa Healy’s reviewing broke that stand, with Australia’s wicketkeeper convincing her captain to go upstairs when Bates missed a sweep and was struck high but right back in front of her stumps on 14. The video projection showed the ball would have hit the top of middle.Devine and Maddy Green each hit a six, and Perry’s departure with injury posed a potential headache for Australia’s bowling rotations. But with seven overs left New Zealand were still 75 runs short, and attack was the only way. Wareham returned and anticipated Devine’s charge, bowling a slow leg-break well wide of off stump, turning past the bat for a stumping.Green and Martin smacked 16 from Nicola Carey, including a simple dropped catch by Schutt at cover, but Wareham replicated her previous dismissal to Green for 28.Needing 48 off 26 with Martin at the crease, it was still possible for New Zealand if the incoming Amelia Kerr could match her previous innings against India, when she ked 34 off 19. Not to be, as Schutt made up for the drop by angling a ball into Kerr’s stumps for two, before having Hayley Jensen scuff a drive to Carey at mid-off next ball. That left 40 needed from three overs, and while Martin tried her best, there were not enough boundary offerings from Jonassen or Schutt, nor from Gardner until it was too late. Given the momentum of the finish, much of the attention had to go back to the start, when the field was up but the run rate wasn’t.An equal New Zealand regret might be Devine’s decision to bowl first, choosing the pressure of the chase in a knockout match, and giving Australia first bat on a pitch that had seen plenty of traffic. Australia made best use of the invitation, with Mooney’s calm 60 off 50 balls covering for Healy’s chip to the infield.There was some early pace and bounce in the wicket, with Lea Tahuhu topping 120kph and throwing in one very sharp bouncer, but Mooney was in perfect position to hook it away from grille height for four. Meg Lanning played some postcard shots, driving Devine through cover before cutting and lofting Anna Peterson, but was caught sweeping for 21.Mooney is not a six-hitter – she cleared the ropes twice in her 743 runs in the last edition of the WBBL – but in this innings the left-hander hit two in five balls, using the angle into her pads of seamer Rosemary Mair from around the wicket, then advancing to Peterson’s off-spin.Gardner was bowled on 20 trying to lift the rate, with Leigh Kasperek smartly darting a ball through her charge. Mooney was on track for her third six of the day before Bates flew into the frame at long-on for a spectacular leap and catch, while Rachael Haynes whacked an unbeaten 19 from 8 balls, and Perry was bowled for 21 off 15 with one ball to spare.Wickets had fallen, but the cake had been iced. Sadly for Australia, Perry’s leg would end up being iced as well. The champion all-rounder had to this date played every match for her country at a T20 world tournament, from the very first back in 2009. That run has surely come to an end, and should Australia make the final at the MCG, it will now be a one-Perry affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea1d9be3554ff6460a9fdf8fcde377deb2fecb8/0_0_3600_2001/master/3600.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc7d67724108e25880411e89b3346e84 1010w","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ec44ac3aaf9654cea4e77026ccdd48ff14f681/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1a7a546976e96d52322dbc34afbb3eb","title":"hamburg locals guide what do see food drink culture boats parks","story":"With buzzy cafes, plenty of green space, music venues, fashion and football, there’s more to the Beatles’ favourite German city than the ReeperbahnOur historic port city is defined by its waterways: the mighty Elbe River, a maze of canals around the warehouses of the Unesco-listed Speicherstadt neighbourhood, and above all the giant lake, the Outer Alster, formed by the Alster River.

A very Hamburg souvenir to take home.• Kampstrasse 11, mojostore.deWhen I arrived in Hamburg, I lived in the St Georg neighbourhood and Café Gnosa, my first local cafe, is a place I love going back to. People always talk to you in here when you sit down, whether you want them to or not. This is a bakery and the cakes are out of this world, perfect for what all Germans love – kaffee und kuchen. St Georg is one of the more gentrified quarters of the city, a favourite LGBTQ+ haunt, and the rainbow flag proudly flies outside the cafe. And just 10 minutes’ walk away is the Kunsthalle, the fine arts museum. • Lange Reihe 93, on FacebookMy home is in the St Pauli district, where I do a Beatles tour of the clubs they started out in, and I would not live anywhere else in the city. Although gentrification is creeping in, there is still a grittiness to this working-class, seamen’s quarter, and while tourists may identify it with the red-light Reeperbahn, this is actually a tolerant, friendly village where everyone knows each other. Start off at my local cafe, Kandie Shop, where friends catch up on gossip and politics over great coffee, waffles and vegan cakes. For dinner, Krug has a warm, gemütlich atmosphere, serving hearty dishes from the south of Germany, and then it’s on for cocktails at the Chug Club, where owner Betty Kupsa stocks 400 tequilas and mezcals. And if you are in town when St Pauli FC play at home, grab a ticket. They are our very own social club, as well as a football team.The island of Kaltehofe (connected to the mainland by a bridge) in the north branch of the Elbe offers unspoiled countryside in the city centre, and few visitors know about it. After a cholera outbreak at the end of the 19th century, Kaltehofe was where Hamburg’s water was purified – filtered through sand in a series of basins. In 1990, the island was abandoned and made off-limits, left to grow wild, but today it has been transformed into a wetlands reserve. It is ideal for cycling to for a picnic or birdwatching, following a bike path through the docks and along river dykes, or the 503 bus takes you direct to the original Wasserkunst waterworks, with exhibitions and a restaurant. On the landward side of the bridge is the perfect spot for a sunset drink, the golden pavilion of Entenwerder 1 cafe, on a pontoon on the Elbe.The vinyl record scene is booming in Hamburg, hardly surprising given the vibrant DJ clubbing scene. Each neighbourhood has its specialist stores but nothing beats the venerable Michelle, a big and beautiful record shop in a quiet side street just off the department stores lining Mönckebergstrasse, the city’s main shopping street. Musicians love Michelle because the staff are so friendly and knowledgeable. It stocks about 30,000 records, from hip-hop and indie to jazz, funk, electro and techno, but you have to come in and browse as it doesn’t sell on the internet. Check Michelle’s Facebook page for its monthly gig, with a band of the moment performing live in the shop window.• Gertrudenkirchhof 10, on FacebookCafé Paris is the most beautiful venue in Hamburg, no question, and every time you go it feels like a special occasion. The 1882 salon is so romantic, with art-deco tiles and a beautiful ceiling fresco. Yes, everything is French – from café au lait and croissants for breakfast, a bubbly glass of crémant for an aperitif, to its signature steak-frites and beef tartare – but the people of Hamburg love it, and it is their favourite place to be seen. For a real slice of local life, come on a Friday lunchtime when it opens Kantine, a no-reservation self-service diner of long communal tables, two floors above the cafe, with the same plat du jour (€14.50) as in the chic brasserie downstairs. • Rathausstrasse 4, cafeparis.netYou can’t come for a weekend in Hamburg and miss the Sunday morning Fischmarkt on the bank of the Elbe. Following a tradition that began in 1703, the church allows fishermen to sell their catch up to 9.30am on a Sunday, so you need to get up early or more likely, given the nearby Reeperbahn’s electric Saturday nightlife, not bother going to bed. The 100-plus stallholders scream out their wares, everyone feasts on our favourite fischbrötchen – rolls stuffed with anything from shrimps to herrings and salmon – then, at the end, the massive auction hall is crowded with partygoers as live bands get the crowds dancing to cover versions of Sweet Caroline, Johnny B Goode and, of course, the Beatles’ Get Back.A tiny chalet sits in the shadow of the crisscross girders of a railway bridge, leaning dangerously like the tower of Pisa. Built a century ago when this was the heart of Hamburg’s busy port area, Oberhafenkantine is the last genuine dockers’ canteen. And it is the place to try Hamburg cuisine: green cabbage with pork chop and wurstel marinated salmon slow-cooked veal cheek with kartoffelsalat (mains from €12). The one dish I tell everyone to try is the traditional sailor’s recipe labskaus. Created to last long sea voyages, it’s a strange but tasty mix of mashed potatoes, corned beef and beetroot, served with a gherkin, pickled herring and fried quail’s egg on top. Although this area looks like an industrial wasteland, the once-abandoned warehouses have actually been transformed into a thriving cultural hub, hosting concerts, theatre, art installations and exhibitions. • Stockmeyerstrasse 39, oberhafenkantine-hamburg.deFor me, as a musician and music lover, Hamburg is one of Europe’s top cities for live entertainment. The clubs the Beatles first played in, the cult Indra and Kaiserkeller, are still going strong and are a dream venue for any up-and-coming band. On the Reeperbahn, Molotow specialises in punk and indie rock, while at Mojo (not to be confused with the fashion boutique, above) there is everything from jazz and funk to roller-disco nights. And since the state-of-the-art Elbphilharmonie concert hall opened three years ago, the city is attracting top classical conductors and musicians. Attending a performance is a memorable experience, and the futuristic building looks like a spaceship.Getting thereTake a ferry from Harwich to Hook of Holland or Newcastle to Amsterdam, then train or Eurostar from St Pancras via Brussels and Cologne.When to goThe Come Together festival, from 27-29 March, celebrates the 60th anniversary of the Beatles’ first concerts in Hamburg.Where to stayIn St Pauli, Superbude Hotel (doubles from €65 room-only, breakfast €10.90) also has dorm beds from €19pp.Discounts and sustainabilityThe new Hamburg CARD Green (from €10.50) has discounts on 40 sustainable attractions, such as zero-waste cafes and cycle toursStefanie Hempel is a singer and ukulele player, and created the Beatles TourLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Yet ITV’s new detectives are the perfect pairing, as they investigate a very middle class murder‘I’m here for two years, tops, so don’t get attached to me,” says DCI Lauren McDonald (Tala Gouveia) at the start of McDonald and Dodds (ITV). Which is no way to launch a TV cop franchise, but still. “But, while I’m here, I’m gonna solve cases in half the time with half the manpower.” Talking about it won’t make it happen.Imagine Simon Pegg from Hot Fuzz as a crime-solving woman of colour with sarcastic eyebrows and you’ll get the picture. McDonald has been transferred from south London’s mean streets to Bath, a city where the worst crimes are usually the prices for cream teas.Well, not quite. There’s a corpse at a millionaire’s mansion, plugged with two slugs from a military-issue sidearm. Despite the panama hat and expensive shirt, the vic had prison tats and a rap sheet as long as the elegant Regency staircase down which he fell to his death.The mansion is owned by Robert Lindsay’s oleaginous entrepreneur, Max Crockett. He made a £30m fortune from making steam irons which, as one cop puts it, are “the best things to come out of Bath since Plasticine”. Plasticine was indeed invented in Bath by William Harbutt. No, not William Hardbutt. He invented chair cushions.Crockett is planning to retire. But to which of his three daughters will he leave his fortune? If the premise sounds like King Lear or Succession, let me say this: Brian Cox didn’t give anything away in Succession. And is Crockett’s artisanal-baker daughter, Ellie, who does such a good Cordelia impression all she seems? Not if I know my crime dramas she isn’t.Whodunnit? “Most murder victims are killed by a member of their own family,” McDonald tells the Crocketts. “Maybe where you come from. But not here,” scoffs Crockett’s Goneril-like daughter, Megan, who is not only vice-chair of Bath’s police oversight committee, but the answer to the question: “Who ate all the lemons?” “We’re nice, middle-class people who go glamping,” says her no-less-citrus-filled barrister husband. “We play boules at the weekend. Where are we going to get a firearm?”McDonald rightly figures she has a family of suspects, all with motives, but no alibis. But how is she going to prove some or all of them are guilty before the sixth and final ad break? Step forward her new partner, DS Dodds. Like Morse, if he has a first name no one has used it for decades. Dodds hasn’t been deployed in a non-desk-related crime scenario for 11 years. The brass so want him to take early retirement that they have put his desk under the air-conditioning, which means he has to wear a scarf. Monsters.I don’t want to endorse the stereotype that Dodds is pale, male and stale, but he wears a tie under a tank top, which is so wrong I don’t know where to start. He may have eyebrows, but they are sneaky ones, so blond that they pass unnoticed on his pasty face. As a result, Jason Watkins, who plays Dodds, has to use not his eyebrows but minimal eye movement to suggest his character’s default mode of existential bewilderment.Watkins was so adorable as W1A’s floral-shirted BBC drone who was literally good for nothing but folding Hugh Bonneville’s Brompton (not a euphemism) that he surprises here as someone with unexpected professional gifts. Dodds breaks the case by spotting a peregrine falcon near the Crockett mansion. Its nest in a nearby church tower, he realises, will be ringed with RSPB-installed cameras, which will show who broke in to the Crocketts’ mansion and offed the stiff.“Good work with the penguin falcon,” says McDonald, still not convinced her new partner isn’t a chump. “Peregrine,” he corrects, saddened by her ignorance of local fauna. The writer, Robert Murphy, has created a lovely double act. Not since Felix Unger tried to vacuum Oscar Madison’s drapes (again, not a euphemism) have I enjoyed the venerable trope of the odd couple so much. Don’t get attached? Too late, ma’am. I already am."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6dbf362604f0e5f80f3b64166403aa0b237c2e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b38c0a73b7f29271596e607213ac6f5c","title":"pete buttigieg drops out of 20202 race to be democratic presidential nominee","story":"Former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, leaves the race to take on Donald Trump after a poor showing in the South Carolina primaryPete Buttigieg has ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination with a call for Democrats to unite in their fight to beat Donald Trump in the election.The 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend has never held statewide or national office but made a strong run in the Democratic primary, winning the Iowa caucuses narrowly from Bernie Sanders, now the national frontrunner, to whom he placed second in New Hampshire.But Buttigieg could not make progress in Nevada and South Carolina, the first two states with influential minority voting blocs.Speaking to supporters in South Bend on Sunday night, Buttigieg issued a call for unity. “Today is a moment of truth ... the truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy if not for our cause.” he said.“We must recognize that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and country together.”“Our goal has always been to unify Americans to help defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for our values.”Joe Biden, the former vice-president, won the South Carolina primary on Saturday by a landslide margin. The next date on the calendar is Super Tuesday, 3 March, when 14 states, American Samoa and Democrats who live overseas will vote.Biden will look to harvest support from Buttigieg as he seeks to establish himself as the moderate choice to deny Sanders. The progressive from Vermont, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, sits in the Senate as an independent. Party figures fear he will not be able to beat Donald Trump in November.Speaking to CNN on Sunday morning, Biden said he had not had any conversations with other candidates about whether they should drop out and back him but added: “I think everyone knows it’s going to be much more difficult to win back the Senate and keep control of the House if Bernie’s at the top of the ticket.”The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar is still in the race and is unlikely to quit before her state votes on Tuesday. The billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is also a centrist candidate for the nomination but he is self-funding his campaign and has not yet entered a primary.Another billionaire moderate, Tom Steyer, dropped out on Saturday night.At first on Sunday, which Buttigieg began with breakfast with former president Jimmy Carter in Plains, Georgia, it did not seem he would take the final step.“Every day we are in this campaign,” he told NBC News, “is a day that we have reached the conclusion that pushing forward is the best thing we can do for the country and for the party.”But later in the day he was out.Sanders responded to Buttigieg’s exit from the campaign on Sunday night with an appeal to his supporters.Rick Wilson, a former Republican consultant turned anti-Trump organiser who advocates a moderate choice of Democratic nominee, wrote on Twitter: “It’s hard to pick the right time to go in a campaign, but Pete Buttigieg did.”It seems likely Buttigieg will remain a figure on the national stage. A charismatic campaigner in the centre lane of the primary, having prepared his ground with a run for party chair in 2016, he built an impressive fundraising operation.He was also the first openly gay candidate for American president.“The Pete Buttigieg story isn’t over. It’s just beginning,” said Democratic strategist David Axelrod. “He’s 38 years old. He’s vaulted himself into the national conversation.”“He obviously has work to do on some things that – some weaknesses we’ve seen in this election – but whenever there is a conversation again about Democratic candidates, he’ll be in that conversation. And that’s a remarkable achievement, given where he started a year ago.”Recently, when the rightwing shock jock and Trump ally Rush Limbaugh questioned whether Americans were ready to vote for a gay president, even the controversialist in the Oval Office was quick to disown the suggestion. On the campaign trail, where he regularly appeared with his husband Chasten, Buttigieg hit back hard.In comments distributed to the media on Sunday, a Buttigieg campaign official said: “Pete was willing to go where no other candidates were – and when he held a Fox News town hall and got a standing ovation, people realised that Pete’s message of moving past our ided politics was truly possible.”One of Buttigieg’s last tweets as a candidate linked to a Michigan ballot initiative on anti-discrimination law and promised supporters that as president he would “help pass the Equality Act, and with your courage and activism … create a community where we all belong”.In a statement, Sarah Kate Ellis, president and chief executive of the Glaad advocacy group, said Buttigieg “showed the world that Americans are ready to accept and embrace qualified LGBTQ public leaders.”Charles Kaiser, a  contributor and the author of The Gay polis: the Landmark History of Gay Life in America, said: “Even though he is leaving the race, his success in Iowa and New Hampshire was transformative.“Before Pete Buttigieg no one knew if an openly gay or lesbian American could be a credible candidate for president. Now, no one from the LGBTQ community will ever grow up thinking their sexuality is an unsurmountable obstacle on the road to the White House.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e6eecd1b9a4022ed39cc48dcbc0cd165114ad5/0_0_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d337208a870aa6c59f75d5510bbbb362","title":"china transferred detained uighurs to factories used by global brands report","story":"At least 80,000 Uighurs working under ‘conditions that strongly suggest forced labour’At least 80,000 Uighurs have been transferred from Xinjiang province, some of them directly from detention centres, to factories across China that make goods for dozens of global brands, according to a report from the Canberra-based Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).Using open-source public documents, satellite imagery, and media reports, the institute identified 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces that have used labourers transferred from re-education centres in Xinjiang since 2017 as part of a programme known as “Xinjiang aid”.In conditions that “strongly suggest forced labour”, the report says, workers live in segregated dormitories, are required to study Mandarin and undergo ideological training. They are frequently subjected to surveillance and barred from observing religious practices. According to government documents analysed by the ASPI, workers are often assigned minders and have limited freedom of movement.The factories were part of supply chains providing goods for 83 global brands, the report found, including Apple, Nike and Volkswagen among others.China has come under mounting international scrutiny for its policies toward Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, where as many as 1.5 million people have been sent to re-education and internment camps. Beijing, which says these facilities are voluntary vocational training centres, has said in recent months that most “students” of such centres have “graduated” and returned to society.The report from the ASPI adds to growing evidence that even after being released from the camps, former detainees are still subject to severe controls and in some cases forced labour. The report’s authors said the actual number of those sent to other parts of China as part of the work programme was “likely to be far higher” than 80,000.“This report exposes a new phase in China’s social re-engineering campaign targeting minority citizens, revealing new evidence that some factories across China are using forced Uighur labour under a state-sponsored labour transfer scheme that is tainting the global supply chain,” the researchers concluded.Case studies highlighted in the report, titled Uyghurs for Sale, include Qingdao Taekwang Shoes, a factory in eastern China that produces shoes for Nike. The workers were mostly Uighur women from the prefectures of Hotan and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang, and attended night classes whose curriculum was similar to that of the re-education camps.According to government notices, workers were required to attend the “Pomegranate Seed” night school, named after a policy that aims to make ethnic minorities and the majority Han Chinese ethnic group as close as the seeds of a pomegranate. At the school, workers study Mandarin, sing the Chinese national anthem and receive “patriotic education”. Public security and other government workers were to give daily reports on the “thoughts” of the Uighur workers.Advertisements for “government-sponsored Uighur labour” have begun to appear more frequently online, according to the researchers. One ad read: “The advantages of Xinjiang workers are: semi-military style management, can withstand hardship, no loss of personnel … minimum order 100 workers!”The report called on China to allow multinational companies unfettered access to investigate any potential instances of abusive or forced labour in factories in China, and for companies to conduct audits and human rights due-diligence inspections.“It is vital that, as these problems are addressed, Uighur labourers are not placed in positions of greater harm or, for example, involuntarily transferred back to Xinjiang, where their safety cannot necessarily be guaranteed,” it said.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, told the Washington Post: “Apple is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. We have not seen this report but we work closely with all our suppliers to ensure our high standards are upheld.” A Volkswagen spokesman told the paper: “None of the mentioned supplier companies are currently a direct supplier of Volkswagen.” He said: “We are committed to our responsibility in all areas of our business where we hold direct authority.”A Nike spokeswoman told the Post: “We are committed to upholding international labour standards globally,” adding that its suppliers are “strictly prohibited from using any type of prison, forced, bonded or indentured labour”. Kim Jae-min, the chief executive of Taekwang, the QingdaoTaekwang factory’s South Korean parent company, said about 600 Uighurs were among 7,100 workers at the plant, adding that the migrant workers had been brought in to offset local labour shortages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81d645c6ca3739f6d6b96d61d6aa096cecb8d78/0_256_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f291b6111f8c799e3f86cc023944a0b0","title":"the worst case scenario for coronavirus dr jonathan quick q and a laura spinney","story":"The former chair of the Global Health Council talks about the mentality that left the world vulnerable to the Covid-19 epidemic and what can be done to minimise its effectsIn 2018 global health expert Jonathan D Quick, of Duke University in North Carolina, published a book titled The End of Epidemics: The Looming Threat to Humanity and How to Stop It. In it he prescribed measures by which the world could protect itself against devastating disease outbreaks of the likes of the 1918 flu, which killed millions and set humanity back decades. He is the former chair of the Global Health Council and a long-term collaborator of the World Health Organization (WHO).The Covid-19 epidemic looks like it’s edging towards becoming a pandemic – that is, as the WHO defines it, “the worldwide spread of a new disease” – but the WHO hasn’t declared a pandemic yet. What are the best-case and worst-case scenarios?The best case is that the Chinese conflagration is brought under control, the smaller “flames” we’ve seen flare up in other countries are extinguished, there’s little or no spread to new countries or continents, and the epidemic dies out. The worst case is that the outbreak goes global and the disease eventually becomes endemic, meaning it circulates permanently in the human population.If the worst-case scenario comes true, are there still things we can do to minimise the pandemic’s impact?Absolutely. We can mobilise more health officials and keep engaging the public, implementing sensible travel controls and ensuring that frontline health workers have ready access to diagnostic tests and are vigilant – that they don’t send anyone who may have been exposed home without testing them, for example. Judging by past experience, however, it’s likely that health officials and the public in much of the world remain unaware or unconvinced of the danger this virus poses.You have said that time and trust are critical to good epidemic management. What do you mean?The delay between the frontline health workers noticing something unusual, in the form of an emerging disease, and that information travelling up the line to central decision-makers is critical. To illustrate that, a 2018 simulation that the Gates Foundation conducted of a flu pandemic estimated that there would be 28,000 deaths after one month, 10 million after three months, and 33 million after six months. The virus used in that simulation was more contagious and deadly than Covid-19 – though they are both respiratory viruses – but the example shows how all epidemics grow exponentially. So if you can catch an epidemic in the first few weeks, it makes all the difference. As for trust, it’s critical to disseminate dispassionate, evidence-based information, and not to try to mislead the population. If you do, they will stop cooperating. Let’s hope that doesn’t happen in China.Is it plausible that the Chinese have already created a Covid-19 vaccine?The US drug company Moderna is the only one I’m aware of that has a Covid-19 vaccine ready for human trials. Those are due to start in April. Chinese firms are new to the global vaccine market, but at least one, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, is working to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.It appears that the Covid-19 virus originated in a “wet” or live animal market. Should such markets be banned?No. The Chinese government tried that after Sars. The markets just went underground. They need to be better regulated, and there needs to be active surveillance. Active monitoring and culling of poultry populations in Asia has stamped out outbreaks of avian flu in those populations.Was an epidemic like that of Covid-19 inevitable?From a biological standpoint an outbreak of a novel pathogen was inevitable, but this one happened in the worst place at the worst time. Wuhan is a big city and a crossroads, and the first cases were recorded there just before the lunar new year, when large numbers of people were about to travel to visit their families.In terms of containing it, was it a good or a bad thing that it happened in China?As of five months ago, we have a measure of epidemic preparedness – the Global Health Security (GHS) Index – that scores countries on six dimensions: prevention, detection, response, health system, risk environment and compliance with international standards. No country scores perfectly on all six. China has detected and responded to this epidemic pretty well, though its health system is now stretched beyond capacity, but it is weak on prevention – particularly when it comes to food safety.How well is the US prepared?The US ranks high on the GHS index, but is still unprepared for a severe pandemic, should one happen. Malfunctioning coronavirus tests have frustrated public health labs and delayed outbreak monitoring. Supplies of masks, suits and other protective material for health workers are running low in the midst of a moderately severe flu season. Since the creation of a much-needed public health emergency preparedness fund in the aftermath of 911, its budget and the public health functions it supports have been steadily reduced. This is the mentality that left the world vulnerable to the devastating 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa – that is, close the fire department and cancel the fire insurance as nobody’s house or factory has burned down lately. It’s time we learned that the bugs never stop mutating and crossing over to humans.Has the world been an ostrich over pandemic risk?Generally speaking, no. After each major recent outbreak – Sars, swine flu, Ebola – we’ve moved ahead. The GHS Index is itself a big advance, because we can now see where inidual countries are weak in terms of preparedness. We should be moving faster, though.What exactly should we be doing faster?Fewer than one in three countries are close to being prepared to confront an epidemic, which leaves the vast majority of the world’s population vulnerable. That in turn leaves us all vulnerable because we’re only as safe as the least safe place. We need to invest more in preparedness, and we need our leaders to take a greater interest in it – that’s all leaders, in both the public and private sectors – from the grass roots to the grass tops.Is a global health agency essential to managing a pandemic, and is the WHO up to the task?A global health agency is essential, yes. None of the advances I’ve mentioned could have happened without the WHO’s involvement, but the WHO can only perform as well as its members allow it to – and they have pulled back on funding since the 2008 financial crisis.Your book is optimistically entitled The End of Epidemics. Could we ever really wave goodbye to epidemics?The world will continue to have disease outbreaks, but there is plenty we can do to protect ourselves against global catastrophes like the 1918 flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9ae4430e3becfe01bd82db6cf4153bbd20dbc3/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7beef93fa8761fa623ee2f5ab3073888","title":"twelve more people test positive coronavirus in uk","story":"Second person in Britain tests positive without having recently travelled abroad as Scotland reports first caseA patient in Essex has become the second person in the UK to test positive for coronavirus without having recently travelled abroad, fuelling concerns that the virus is circulating in Britain undetected.Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the patient “had no relevant travel” and an investigation was under way to determine whether the patient contracted the virus directly or indirectly from someone who had recently returned from overseas.The case suggests the country is edging closer to the point where containment becomes impossible because the virus is being spread by people who are either unaware they are infected, or are diagnosed too late to prevent onward transmission.The Essex patient was among 13 new cases reported on Sunday, bringing the total UK infections to 36. It is the largest single-day increase of new cases in the UK so far. One of the new cases is the first to be reported in Scotland, while two cases in total had previously been reported in Northern Ireland and Wales.The patient in Scotland, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee on Sunday evening and will be taking part in a similar meeting chaired by Boris Johnson on Monday morning. Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: “This really adds to the supposition that many are now making that this one is going to be very hard to put back in the box. It makes it particularly difficult to control any outbreak if there are people who don’t know they’re spreading it.”Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting on Monday to review the next steps aimed at containing the virus, and he will tell those signing off the strategy that the government will “stop at nothing” to fight the disease.The meeting will be attended by senior ministers as well as Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in order to ratify the government’s proposed countermeasures.The prime minister is set to tell those at the meeting: “The number of coronavirus cases around the world is rising every day – and the UK is no exception. There now seems little doubt that it will present a significant challenge for our country.“But we are well prepared, and the government and the NHS will stop at nothing to fight this virus. This battle plan lays out in detail the measures we could use – if and when they are needed.”Johnson had been dubbed a “part-time” prime minister by critics for failing to take charge of a Cobra meeting before this week. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed on Sunday that the government would publish its approach to coronavirus this week but conceded it was inevitable that the virus would continue to spread across the UK. The NHS is planning to bring doctors out of retirement to cope if the outbreak escalates and Hancock did not rule out following China’s lead and isolating cities to contain the virus.“There is clearly a huge economic and social downside to that,” Hancock told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “But we don’t take anything off the table at this stage because you have to make sure you have all the tools available if that is what is necessary.”Emergency powers to slow the spread of the virus, if it becomes endemic, would only be temporary, Hancock added. He said “population distancing measures” such as banning public gatherings and cancelling football matches might be considered and closing schools could become necessary.On Friday, a man from Haslemere in Surrey became the first person known to have caught the infection in the UK. Three of the men’s relatives, one also from Surrey and two from West Sussex, are among the new cases, forming an “adult family cluster”, said James Mapstone at Public Health England. At the weekend, the Prince of Wales pub in the town closed for deep cleaning after landlords said one of its customers had tested positive. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “Although it may still be possible to prevent a community-wide epidemic, this is looking increasingly unlikely and we should be prepared to cope with a more widespread epidemic on our shores.” The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Of the remaining eight new cases, six had recently returned from Italy and two from Iran. All of the new patients, from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire, are being investigated and their close contacts traced.The sudden rise in cases came as health authorities scrambled to track down people who had come into contact with a 35-year man from Shenzhen in China, who had been working in Bristol and tested positive for coronavirus after taking a Cathay Pacific flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong on Thursday.A statement from the Guangdong health commission late on Sunday said authorities in Shenzhen had declared an “imported case” of the coronavirus after the man tested positive. It is unclear whether or not he became infected in the UK, but Chinese authorities said two of the patient’s colleagues in the UK had reported coughs and fever.The man travelled from London to Hong Kong on 27 February on Cathay Pacific flight CX250. After landing in Hong Kong he took a ferry to Shekou port and from there entered mainland China.While the man’s temperature was normal on arrival, he developed a cough and fever on 29 February and was driven to a hospital where he tested positive for coronavirus. He is now having treatment in Shenzhen, where his condition was described as stable.Chuang Shuk-kwan, the director of the infectious disease ision of the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong, advised all passengers on Thursday’s Cathay CX250 flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong, or on ferry number 3A109, to call the centre’s hotline and to be “aware of the health situation”, and seek medical help or quarantine if necessary. A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said the plane was being disinfected and the airline was helping authorities trace passengers who came into close contact with the man.Among measures announced by the Department of Health and Social Care on Sunday were a ministerial lead on the virus in every department and a cross-Whitehall “war room” to coordinate a beefed-up public information campaign.One of the newly confirmed cases is a patient from Bury in Greater Manchester, who is being treated at a specialist NHS infection centre, according to Bury council. Will Welfare, the interim deputy director of health protection for Public Health England North West, said the agency was tracing people who had close contact with the patient, who became infected while in Italy.Another case, identified on Saturday, is a member of staff at St Mary’s school in Tetbury, Gloucestershire. The school has been closed until at least Wednesday because of “operational difficulties” with staff rather than any ongoing health risk, according to a letter sent to parents from Jo Woolley, the headteacher. She said a deep clean was carried out on Saturday and that all people who had contact with the infected staff member had been spoken to.“The thing I would urge every organisation and every business to do is to really start planning, as of now, for how people are going to manage to work remotely and cover each other’s jobs in the event that people have to take time off from work,” said Openshaw. “It’s planning for resilience in the eventuality that the spread is going to continue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7504b65a5fde3c9dc292c75ff64199818a1644de/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2314e0ea032f99be86d6b54253a1780f","title":"britain is leaving europe the guardian is not","story":"The editor-in-chief explains why the  is deepening its commitment to European voices, issues and peopleToday we are making a renewed and deeper commitment to reporting on every aspect of Europe – the continent, its people, its politics, institutions, economy and culture. is a European news organisation with a close relationship with our large and committed audience in Europe.

Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, adviser to the Saudi royal court and supervisor general of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief fund (KSRelief), said he was sure the Houthis would try to hinder aid, and pressure should be put on them, but not in a way that “harms poor children, women or people at risk”.Roughly 17 million people in Yemen are expected to be dependent on humanitarian aid this year.To the alarm of Saudi Arabia, the Houthis confirmed on Sunday they have captured the strategically important Al-Hazam city, the capital of Al-Jawf province, which borders Saudi Arabia. It marks the Houthis’ first capture of an administrative city in two years in Yemen, and follows months of fighting. The province is thought to have the largest oil reserves in Yemen, and the Houthi success immediately led to Saudi air strikes. However, throughout the five-year civil war Saudi Arabia has not been able to translate air superiority into success on the ground.Raab is expected to meet the president of Yemen’s UN-recognised government, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, to discuss the war effort, including the Saudi mediation to bring together Hadi’s forces and those of the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC). The Saudis brokered an agreement between the two sides in the south but it seems largely unimplemented, leaving the forces arrayed against the Houthis still badly ided.The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, is working on a plan to bring together the Houthis, Hadi’s forces and the STC at some form of national talks. The Houthi military advance will strengthen its hand in those talks, and critics of Griffiths said he has been too accommodating to the Houthis at a time when they will not end their offensive.Raab’s aides said he will also raise restrictions to free expression and human rights in Saudi Arabia, an oblique reference to the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul more than a year ago.Britain has said its future relations with Saudi Arabia will depend on how the kingdom handles the killing and the degree to which Britain has confidence such an event will not reoccur.The UK is eager to get co-operation with Riyadh back on track partly because, as chair of the UN climate change conference in November, the country needs to work closely in tandem with Saudi Arabia – the chair of this year’s G20."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0585ef4b250b88082b77e50e24c0a9c320a6731d/0_88_2490_1493/master/2490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51c5f9b444a7d9e39d12cbbd113197a6","title":"israel election round three begins as voters head to the polls","story":"Netanyahu says main rival Gantz ‘not a leader’, while Gantz has focused on PM’s alleged corruptionIsraelis have begun voting in the country’s third election within the space of a year in a fight Benjamin Netanyahu is desperate to win on the eve of a criminal corruption trial against him.More than 6.3 million people are eligible to cast their votes in polling stations that will close at 10pm (8pm GMT) on Monday, after which exit polls will be reported.For the more than 5,000 Israelis who were under precautionary home isolation after returning from areas of the world affected by coronavirus, special voting booths covered in plastic sheeting had been set up around the country. Ten Israelis have contracted the virus and are quarantined. The health ministry, however, has urged people that it is safe to vote.Over the weekend, in the final stretch of a campaign that has increasingly descended into mudslinging, Netanyahu and his main rival, the former army chief Benny Gantz, ripped into each other.Netanyahu told Channel 12 that Gantz was “not fit” to be prime minister. “He is weak he’s not a leader,” he said. Gantz said in another interview that his opponent was acting as if he was part of a mafia.The country has been in a state of political crisis for almost 12 months after two previous general elections failed to produce a clear winner.Central to the deadlock is the Israeli prime minister, the longest-serving in the country’s history, who has managed to persuade allies and even some foes that rematch after rematch is preferable to any deal that does not include him as leader.Gantz has focused his campaign on Netanyahu’s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves, but he also failed to form a government after coming out marginally ahead in the previous election.In an embarrassing blow to Gantz four days before the election, a recording emerged on Thursday of his top strategist, Israel Bachar, privately complaining to his rabbi of his boss’s lack of “courage”. Local press reported the rabbi had secretly recorded the conversation.Gantz fired Bachar for the comments but the words played into one of Netanyahu’s biggest campaign tactics – arguing that Gantz does not have the stomach to face the country’s security issues.Netanyahu’s other election strategy has been to energise his hardline nationalist base, with promises of land grabs from Palestinians.On Tuesday, he announced he would go ahead with a highly controversial plan to build settlements east of Jerusalem. The plan would almost completely encircle Palestinian neighbourhoods in the holy city.The prime minister made similar appeals before the previous votes. In April, he said he would annex all current settlements, and in September he promised to go further, by claiming sovereignty over a third of the entire West Bank.He has also looked to his rightwing global ally, Donald Trump, to help him convince Israelis that he is the only leader able to garner concessions from world powers.In late January, the US president appeared to gift Netanyahu just that, revealing a “vision for peace” plan in the White House that read like a checklist of demands from the Israeli far right. It gave the country Jerusalem, huge swathes of the Palestinian territories and permanent security control over Palestinians, whose leadership rejected the plan as flagrantly biased.In preparation for election day, the Israeli military closed crossings with the occupied West Bank, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under Israeli rule but cannot vote, and Gaza, where 2 million more live under a blockade.Meanwhile, a November indictment for three major corruption cases against him has dented Netanyahu’s image. He is expected to appear in court on 17 March, the first day of his criminal trial.It is still not clear if the two major developments since the September election – Trump’s plan and Netanyahu’s indictment – would affect voters. Recent polls suggested they have little to no impact, with Netanyahu’s Likud party just ahead of Gantz’s Blue and White party. However, neither side appear to have enough allies to form a majority coalition.Political parties fear a low turnout on Monday as voters become apathetic about the political stalemate and fearful of the spread of coronavirus, issues that could drastically affect the result in such a small country.In a survey released last week, the Israeli Voice Index, the most popular prediction for the election outcome was another election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7eea168c87139e67b4e2132673bedb9acc0e7f/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52531a9a63808f000b4da12a7c6d0dd7","title":"remain in mexico asylum seekers at border see hopes raised then dashed","story":"Many hoping to enter the US but kept out by Trump policy remain stuck in squalid and dangerous conditionsEsmeralda Martínez got the news via a WhatsApp message: a court had invalidated the US “remain in Mexico” program, which had obliged her to stay put south of the border while her asylum claim was heard.It had been six months since she fled Guatemala after the murder of her husband. For a brief moment, it seemed she and her 13-year-old daughter Jazmín might be able to move on from the dismal frontier encampment were they have been stranded.She packed her court papers in a black and yellow backpack, stuffed her clothes into a suitcase and prepared to move on.But just hours after Friday’s ruling, the same three-judge panel suspended its own order pending fresh arguments, leaving the policy formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in full effect.Despite the confusion, the temporary invalidation of MPP offered rare hope for around 2,500 migrants living in the insecure and insalubrious tent city along the Rio Grande in the city of Matamoros, a stronghold of the notorious Gulf Cartel.Dozens of asylum-seekers, some clutching printed copies of the 57-page court decision, headed straight to the bridge separating Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas. They were turned back by US border guards.“We were all hoping for this inhumane and macabre program to be invalidated,” said Joel Fernández, 51, a Cuban asylum-seeker who also had his bags packed.MPP has forced more than 60,000 migrants to wait in some of Mexico’s most dangerous cities. The Mexican government pledged to provide work permits and access to healthcare, housing and educational opportunities, but those promises have largely gone unfulfilled.And as they wait, the migrants are easy targets for criminal gangs.In one month last year, three-quarters of asylum seekers seen by physicians working for Doctors Without Borders in the city of Nuevo Laredo reported having been kidnapped for ransom.Over the weekend, immigration lawyers attempted to clear the confusion, convening scrums of migrants and trying to answer their questions.“There’s good news and bad news,” said Jodi Goodwin, a Brownsville immigration attorney, counselling the asylum seekers stay the course: “Everyone must continue preparing their cases you need to continue going to court.”She also cautioned against illegal entry to the US. The number of asylum claims in cities like Brownsville has been declining. A crackdown by Mexican authorities has choked the migrant flow, while expedited expulsion and the new policy of sending migrants to Guatemala has reduced the numbers of people waiting for an asylum decision.“We’re seeing dramatically lower numbers in Brownsville,” said Charlene D’Cruz, an immigration lawyer.MPP “worked” as proponents hoped, D’Cruz said, as “it took 60,000 people out” of the traditional asylum process. “But do we mean by success? Humanity-wise, we have completely failed as a people.”As the number of asylum seekers from Central America and further afield slowly dwindles in Matamoros, a new group has replaced them: Mexicans fleeing rampant violence in central and southern states.Mariana came to the camp with her family six weeks ago from Veracruz state, where she says a drug cartel tried to forcibly recruit her teenage son. Her turn to apply for asylum was fast approaching – and couldn’t come fast enough.“We’ve gone hungry. We’ve been cold. We’ve had to bathe in the river,” she said as she cooked eggs and chilies for her children. “This is a desperate place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cf2419445cdf8147d10c3e738dbf23c05dcec54/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=311a574344d51811cda28163f8206567","title":"europe britain superpower european","story":"As a European leader once remarked, Europe should be a superpower, not a superstate. Faced with an increasingly powerful and authoritarian China, global heating, the challenge of AI, not to mention an aggressive Russia, chaotic Middle East and Trumpian United States, this argument is more compelling than ever. In a world of giants, you need to be a giant yourself. If we Europeans don’t hang together, we will hang separately.Most Europeans agree with this simple proposition. Indeed, this is one of the big things they want the European Union to do. But is Europe up to the job? The answer is not a simple yes or no. It depends what dimension of power we are talking about. In trade negotiations, the EU, which represents the biggest and richest multinational single market in the world through a single negotiator, is already a superpower. It has made trade deals with major economies, such as Canada and Japan, of which Brexit Britain can only dream.The EU is a superpower, too, in the unsexy but vital area of regulation. Just ask Facebook or Google. In effect, Brussels sets the privacy standards for the worldwide internet (although not for the now largely separate Chinese internet). An interesting new book on the EU as a regulatory superpower, The Brussels Effect by Anu Bradford, carries the noughties nostalgia-inducing subtitle “How the European Union rules the world”. Well, publishers will be publishers, but somewhere in there is a grain of truth.The EU is not a superpower in respect of the climate crisis, but it does have a halfway coherent strategy for a European Green Deal, the flagship policy of what the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has described as her “geopolitical” commission. The proportion of waffle in the EU’s external relations is still alarmingly high – “why do they talk so much?” an Indian official whispered to a friend of mine, as senior representatives of each EU institution had their wordy say on a visit to India – but there is some effective action. The EU shows a significant degree of coherence in relation to many smaller countries and poorer parts of the world. Europe is the world’s largest donor of official development aid.For four decades from the 1970s to the 2000s, the EU’s most powerful external policy was enlargement. Whole societies were transformed in southern, central and eastern Europe, as countries lined up to join this unprecedented, anti-imperial empire. But now there is such enlargement fatigue that even accession talks with tiny North Macedonia were nearly kiboshed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. No one is seriously talking about prospective membership for Turkey, as we were in the early 2000s, and things are not all that much better for Ukraine.Europe is least impressive when it comes to relations with great powers. At a meeting of the European Council on Foreign Relations some years ago, we started with Russian, Chinese and American speakers giving us their views of Europe. They were three very cold showers. There was a remarkable degree of overlap in the reasons the three speakers gave for criticism of Europe that sometimes verges on contempt. Seen from Beijing, Moscow or Washington, Europe too often appears weak, ided and hypocritical.What can Europe do about this, besides getting its enlargement mojo back? One answer is offered by the European federalist Guy Verhofstadt, who is slated to be the chair of a new Conference on the Future of Europe. When I spoke to him in Brussels recently, he said his message could really be boiled down to a simple formula: ending unanimity. So his remedy is institutional, concentrated on getting the union to take more decisions by majority vote. In short, Europe must be a superstate before it becomes a superpower.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. There are three flaws in this solution, of which the first is already fatal: there is no majority for it among the governments and peoples of Europe. Such far-reaching institutional changes are also not necessary for a more coherent and effective European external policy. And it has no place for European states that are either not, not yet or, in the singular case of Britain, no longer members of the European Union.Fortunately, there is another way that we can still work together towards the goal of being a superpower. It can be summed up in the Nike slogan: “Just do it.” This is how we have achieved a European policy on Iran, for example, and to some extent on Ukraine. All it requires is for a group of states, ideally including Germany, France and Britain (the “E3” of Iran policy), wherever possible together with some other relevant European states (Poland and the Baltic countries for east European challenges, for example Spain and Italy for Mediterranean ones), to develop an effectively co-ordinated policy, working closely with the EU’s high representative on foreign and security policy. Supported by the EU’s own diplomatic service, known as the European External Action Service, the high representative can also represent the interests of other member states, and bring their active or passive support. No major institutional change is needed, let alone a federalist great leap forward, and the beauty of this pragmatic method is that it can still fully engage the heft of countries such as Britain.What it does require, however, is a shared strategic analysis of the threat, convergent understandings of national interests and a lot of political will. That remains a tall order. Let me be clear: I don’t think it’s likely that Europe will get its act together in this way. The hard or even no-deal Brexit towards which we seem to be heading will make it even more difficult to achieve. My point is simply that it is still desirable, even essential, and still possible.Among today’s European leaders, Macron is the one who most clearly articulates this strategic ambition, even if his specific proposals are not always persuasive. If he could find some equally strategic and ambitious partners in Berlin, London, Madrid, Rome and other national capitals, as well as in Brussels, Europe could still aspire to be a superpower. Just do it. And remember, before she became an American running shoe, Nike was a European goddess of victory."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Photograph:  Jalaa MareyAFPGettyA Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease. The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it. Low risk It is understood the risk to other pupils in the north Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening: “Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary.

Photograph: Jallaa MareyAFPThe Republic’s first case of coronavirus has forced the closure of a Dublin secondary school on infection control grounds.More than 400 students of the school are today beginning two weeks off after public health officials ordered it to shut to prevent the spread of the disease.Meanwhile, public health officials are expected to decide on Monday on restrictions that will apply to mass gatherings in light of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. The restrictions to be decided by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) may affect the St Patrick’s Day Festival and other big events over the coming months.NPHET made the decision to close the Dublin school after learning that the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus had became ill after returning from Italy and going back to school. He is currently in isolation in a hospital in the capital.Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease. The decision was announced by NPHET at a briefing on Sunday evening.“Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school,” said Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer with the Department of Health. “Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.”Dr Holohan called for patient confidentiality in this case, and all others, to be respected. The department would provide updated information as necessary, he said.However, the school was quickly identified on social media following the NPHET briefing.Dr Holohan said no other schools were affected and there was “no reason” for any other school to close. Travel to ItalyHe also expressed opposition to any further travel restrictions on Italy, over and above those already in place.With more than 1,100 cases, Italy has the highest concentration of coronavirus cases of any state in Europe. Parents of children attending the school last night received a letter from the HSE saying a case of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) had been identified and “to prevent the possible spread of infection” the school had been closed until Monday, March 16th. “As a precaution, all students and staff at the school are being treated as possible contacts of the case,” the letter states. “Because your child may have had contact with someone who has Covid-19, it is possible that they might have picked up the virus and could become unwell or pass the virus on to other people.”Public health staff will monitor children over the next 14 days “as a disease control measure”, according to the letter. Parents are asked to isolate children from others “without delay” if they develop symptoms of the disease over this time and to contact their GP.No visitorsThe letter asks students to limit their social interactions “in so far as possible” during this period, adding: “This includes not having visitors to the house.”Students have been told to avoid social gatherings and crowded settings, not to attend school, work or sporting events and to avoid contact with the elderly, those with chronic health problems and pregnant women.They should not travel outside Ireland and have been told to discuss travel plans within Ireland with public health officials. Other household members do not need to restrict their activities.Scotland last night reported its first case of the virus, while in France the Louvre museum remained shut over the weekend after the government banned large gatherings in confined spaces."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"National Public Health Emergency Team to decide on mass gatherings on MondayDuke and Duchess of Cambridge will also meet Varadkar and travel to four countiesAmong the dead in Louth crash were an elderly woman (80s) and her son (50s)Report criticises firm paid \u0026euro330,000-plus under State distressed borrowers\u0026rsquo schemeStatus yellow snowice warning in place until Monday morningDonegal industry fears Irish boats losing the right to fish lucrative British watersSeven people killed on the roads in counties Louth, Galway, Monaghan and CavanLabour leadership contender lengthened rent review period as a minister in 2015Analysis: The delay in its arrival bought us valuable time in which to prepareNetwork Ireland survey highlights pressures and worries of working mothersPlan to build homes on East Wall site deemed at odds with finishing circular motorwayPascal Lamy, the former EU commissioner, says broad outline of EU-UK trade could be agreed by year-endElderly and disabled residents say new owners of complex have removed servicesOrganisation, which has never had a claim, is denied coverFianna F\u0026aacuteil deputies warn Martin\u0026rsquos leadership may come into question over the issuePest-control firms say restricted use of poison is behind rise of rodents in food premisesOver 400 students at Dublin school begin two weeks off to prevent spread of infectionPricewatch: Glitch between AIB and French toll operators set to cause more traffic jamsPricewatch: Many warranties run out after a year whereas your consumer rights don\u0026rsquotPricewatch: Reader describes failure to provide entitled refund as `very frustrating\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190190.1583143573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus health officials defend decision not to name school with first case","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr John Cuddihy,  Dr Tony Holohan and Dr Ronan Glynn during a media update on the confirmed case of Coronavirus in Ireland. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.The State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, has defended the handling of the country’s first confirmed case of the coronavirus, which has forced the closure of a Dublin secondary school on infection control grounds.More than 400 students of the school are today beginning two weeks off after public health officials ordered it to shut to prevent the spread of the disease.Dr Holohan again declined to identify the school pointing out that confidentiality must be maintained so that the public would feel confident about coming forward if they thought they might have contracted the virus.A series of measures had been outlined to parents of pupils at the school urging the students to limit their social interactions and not to attend social gatherings.The Health Service Executive (HSE) will hold a public meeting on Monday evening for parents who will also be texted daily to check on symptoms so there can be immediate action and follow up if necessary.“We felt this was a proportionate measure, in the event that someone else becomes ill, they can be diagnosed quickly,” Dr Holohan said on Monday. The senior health official said he understood the impact this could have on families with parents potentially having to take time off work to care for their child, and it was a decision that had not been taken lightly.Minister for Health Simon Harris defended the HSE’s decision not to publicly name the affected school. In a post on Twitter he said health officials “have to protect anyone who comes forward with symptoms of coronavirus.” “They are acting in the public interest and helping our national and global efforts to contain this virus. Contact tracing ensures anyone who needs to know knows,” he said. Dr Holohan said decisions from sports clubs near the school to cancel training sessions were not necessary. The HSE will find ways to work with all organisations to help provide responses that were proportionate, he said.He warned that social media had highlighted concerns that had no basis in fact. “Anyone with access to social media, has access to hse.ie for accurate information,” he said. Some of the information being shared on social media was “completely false” and the public should rely only on “trusted sources,” he said.St Patrick’s DayDr Holohan said this was a fast changing situation and it was difficult to predict what might be of concern in 10 days time, such as large gatherings like the St Patrick’s Day parade.The chief medical officer was also adamant that the country has sufficient hospital isolation rooms, and pointed out that most people who had been infected elsewhere had experienced only a mild infection.When asked about the possibility of people being infected a second time, Dr Holohan said this was “an open scientific question” as there was much still unknown about the virus.Public health officials are expected to decide on Monday on restrictions that will apply to mass gatherings in light of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. The restrictions to be decided by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) may affect the St Patrick’s Day Festival and other big events such as concerts and sports matches over the coming months.Last week a decision was taken to cancel the Ireland vs Italy Six Nations rugby match, due to take place in the Aviva Stadium this Saturday. This came after a significant outbreak of the coronavirus in parts of northern Italy.

It meant that, in effect, anyone who faced a rent review that year did not face another one until 2017.In 2016, the Fine Gael-led minority government brought in the current policy of rent pressure zones (RPZs), which restrict rent increases to four per cent per year in designated areas.Most cities, their surrounding areas and large towns are now designated as RPZs but there have been calls from the Labour Party, Sinn Féin and others for a three-year rent freeze.Fianna Fáil had considered adopting such a policy last year but has since said it has received legal advice saying it would be unconstitutional.‘Matter of policy’Mr Kelly, a Tipperary TD, is competing against Dublin Bay North TD Aodhán O’Ríordáin for the leadership of the Labour Party. They take part in the first of five head-to-head debates in Cork on Monday.Mr Kelly has repeated a call for a rent freeze and has published a section of the legal advice given to him in 2015 which he says outlines how it could be implemented.The portion of the advice said the “length of interference with protected property rights can be a factor in determining whether such interference is justifiable”. It said the duration of such interference “should be supported by a clear policy rationale and extensive market analysis to ensure it will be found reasonable, proportional and minimally invasive of established property rights”.“Ultimately, the duration is a matter of policy – if the length selected can be objectively justified and supported by cogent evidence, then it should be defensible as a proportionate measure.”Mr Kelly said: “While the State cannot direct landlords to set inidual prices, both the Dáil and Seanad have the legislative power to regulate the frequency of rent reviews. This gives rise to an effective rent freeze.“This means, as a temporary measure, we can easily extend the time period under which rent reviews are allowed and this delays future rent increases for a temporary period. It is easily achievable under the Constitution to legally set this period to three years. There is no need for a referendum.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189530.1583082615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fishing why it is the first flashpoint issue in eu uk trade talks","story":"Fishermen and industry officials in Killybegs, Co Donegal highlight the fraught issues surrounding fishing rights as EU and UK post-Brexit trade negotiations begin. Video: Chris Maddaloni\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFishing could be the biggest obstacle to a deal in the upcoming trade talks.Michael Cavanagh stands on the quayside in Killybegs, Ireland’s largest fishing harbour. He points at a docked trawler in Co Donegal port to give a sense of how large his own fishing boat is.The Father McKee is the Greencastle man’s 65m trawler and is out with his sons in the north Bay of Biscay off France fishing for boarfish, a small fish used to make meal for feeding salmon. Cavanagh does not fish anymore – “too many birthdays”, says the 70-year-old.The UK’s decision to exit the European Union and the potential closing of soon-to-be British waters, on top of existing restrictions, has made life stormier onshore for Irish fishermen like Cavanagh.“We have more challenges ashore than when we are at sea,” says Cavanagh, buffeted by blustery Donegal weather on the quayside.Even before negotiations on a trade deal between the EU and UK start on Monday, the two sides have already clashed over fishing rights. Fishing, it is feared, could be the biggest obstacle to a deal.Brussels has tied any post-Brexit free trade agreement to a reciprocal deal on fisheries that will allow EU boats to fish in British waters and British-caught fish to be sold in EU markets.In stark contrast, Britain’s negotiating position, set out last week, does not include fisheries as part of any future trade deal. Instead, the UK wants to stop European fishing vessels from accessing British waters and to negotiate any access and permitted catches on an annual basis.Even though fishing accounts for just 0.1 per cent of the UK economy, the sector has become totemic of Boris Johnson’s dogged “take back control” political agenda heading into the trade negotiations. Protecting British waters have become a visceral symbol of Johnson’s post-Brexit vision. It is not surprising Brexit and his trade plans enjoy strong support in the UK’s depleted coastal fishing communities. However, there are practical problems to his negotiating position.“The UK wants to take back control of their fishing. On the other hand, they will have to recognise that most fish caught in British waters is exported to the EU, so there is not a lot of point in taking control of your waters if you don’t have an export market,” said David O’Sullivan, the Irish former EU director general for trade.Fishing will be the first flashpoint issue as both sides have set July 1st as the target date for a deal on fisheries to give time for negotiations with third countries such as Norway and Iceland in October and November to finalise quota agreements on widely distributed fishing stocks.“That is a tall order and extremely difficult but not impossible,” says Sean O’Donoghue, chief executive of the Killybegs Fishermen’s Organisation.The fact that migratory fish like mackerel caught by Donegal trawlers do not stop at man-made borders makes the range of potential solutions large and the negotiations highly complex.“It is very difficult to explain to a fish that there is a border whereas you can do that to a human and a lorry driver,” Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the World Trade Organisation and a one-time EU trade commissioner, told The .In Donegal, Cavanagh sees the political posturing ahead of talks starting as “sabre-rattling”. However, the concern that fisheries would be cast adrift in favour of the more pressing post-Brexit arrangements facing other more lucrative and powerful industries is palpable in Killybegs. Cavanagh believes that the industry has “become the sacrificial lamb” of the negotiations.MackerelIreland’s fishing fleets rely heavily on fishing in UK waters to make a living and nowhere is the concern about the collapse of trade talks more keenly felt than in Killybegs.“No trade deal is a disaster, a total disaster, because it’s vitally important for us that the link between the wider trade negotiations and the fisheries is maintained,” says Cavanagh.“It is never going to be as good as it was, no matter what deal we get.”Donegal fishing trawlers traditionally catch mackerel north and northeast of the Irish coast and as far east as the Shetlands, north of Scotland. When the Brexit standstill period expires at the end of the year – and if there is no deal – these waters will be out of bounds to Irish boats.Mackerel, part of the valuable pelagic stocks landed by the large trawlers that sustains Killybegs and the Donegal fishing industry, are at their most valuable before they start migrating south and southwest towards the Irish coast where they are slimmer and their fat content declines.This year, the fish only started reaching Irish and EU waters in the second week in February, by which time Japanese buyers have stopped purchasing stocks as the quality of the fish has declined.Long term, being “out of British waters” could cripple the industry, says Cavanagh.“Our income will fall, our overheads will rise because when the mackerel are north they are in large shoals. You shoot and tow on a spot of mackerel for maybe 10 minutes. Down here, they are scattered out and you spend longer towing for them,” he says.“If you get a mixed fishery, the horse mackerel damage them, the quality is less and nobody wants to be picking through them in the factories. It is not a good product.“It is vitally important that we get access to the UK waters.”On average, mackerel caught in British waters makes up 60 per cent of the Irish fleet’s catch, though it can be as high as 75 per cent. The fleet is 40 per cent dependent on access to the UK waters, mostly in fishing areas west of Cornwall, for nephrops, or prawns. For these species, the economic value of UK waters to the Irish fleet is 60 per cent. For all species, it is 29 per cent.O’Donoghue of the Killybegs Fishermen’s Organisation said that loss of access to British waters would be “unmitigated disaster” for the Irish industry. The value of the industry would be halved to €600 million, he estimates, and between 30 and 40 per cent of the 14,500 people employed in coastal communities around the country would lose their jobs.The fallout would not stop there as Irish, British, Dutch and French naval vessels could be forced to manage fishermen unwilling to recognise an “artificial line at sea” if there is no deal. He expects “clashes at sea” not unlike the “scallop war” between French and British boats in 2018.“There will be chaos on the high seas between the different countries. People are not going to accept that they are out of waters that they have fished in for generations. There will be flashpoints and port blockades – it is inevitable,” he said.‘We need stability’A short walk from the quay, Sean Óg Ward’s fish processing factory is quiet for now. He is expecting another catch of fish in two days. At peak, he employs 105 people from August to April processing mackerel, horse mackerel, herring, sprat and blue whiting. He has 30 employees for the rest of the year. Last season, up to 90 per cent of his mackerel came from British waters, he says.He fears that in the event of no trade deal boats will not be able to catch mackerel until February when it could run into the start of the blue whiting season, reducing the size and value of both catches to the Donegal fishing industry.“If we don’t get the fish out of UK waters, we are in trouble. The whole industry is in trouble. We need stability. We can’t invest in the company. We don’t know what will happen,” says the Donegal man whose business turned over €60 million last year.The fishing industry in Donegal is also concerned about what will happen to the waters off the Irish west coast if EU fishing fleets, displaced from British waters, arrive in these fishing grounds.“It is already a crowded area without putting everybody into it. It would have a crazy effect on stocks and stability and supplies and business models. It just wouldn’t work and it would be disaster for the Irish, a complete disaster,” says Ward.Standing in a passing rain shower on Killybegs pier, Cavanagh hopes – following the age-old negotiating principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed – that fisheries can be kept on the negotiating table for the duration of the talks to extract the most leverage for the industry.“It is like the little boy on a toilet: nothing’s finished until the paperwork is done,” he says.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan BetsonGovernment formation talks continue this week, with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael due to hold a policy exchange meeting in the coming days. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he intends leading Fine Gael into opposition, but his party will hold policy meetings with the Green Party on Monday. The Greens have also held meetings with Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin in recent weeks, and sources in both of the larger parties have said they want the pace of the negotiations to quicken. One Fianna Fáil TD said the public health and economic threat posed by the coronavirus should encourage all parties to accelerate the government formation process.Mr Martin last month told his parliamentary party that a new government may not be formed until April. Some of his TDs have privately said the Cork South Central TD’s leadership of Fianna Fáil will come into question if a government is not in place by the end of next month. One member of the Fianna Fáil frontbench said the leadership of the party was not being actively discussed, despite a call from outgoing party senator Keith Swanick for Mr Martin to resign.Mr Swanick was involved in controversy last year over revelations that he had recorded his presence in Leinster House while rarely voting. Mr Martin said he had questions to answer on the issue. The frontbench TD privately said it was “quiet” in Fianna Fáil on Mr Martin’s leadership while government talks continued. “All quiet awaiting to see where this goes,” the TD said. “If it goes nowhere, he’s gone.” It was added that Mr Martin would be given “max” until the end of April.Another senior TD said: “There will be six to eight weeks of a period given. Everyone is ready for at least another six weeks of this process.”Untenable positionOther TDs said if Mr Martin brought a proposal for a coalition involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens to a special ardfheis but lost a vote of party members on such a government, his position would be untenable. However, it is stressed by Fianna Fáil TDs that they want Mr Martin to become taoiseach. A coalition involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens is mentioned most often as a potential government but there is significant resistance to the idea in each of the parties. “The grassroots and the councillors are very opposed,” one Fianna Fáil TD said. “The grand coalition is still the most likely but, as time goes on, that could fall through the cracks as well.” Another TD added: “The biggest issue now is with the membership base in Fianna Fáil.”It comes as some sources in both Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil say the government talks process must speed up, in particular their engagements with the Green Party. A Sinn Féin source said the party was “very keen for these engagements to accelerate a bit”, adding: “At some point, people are going to have to decide if they are up for this or not.”Sinn Féin is seeking to assemble a government of the left under Mary Lou McDonald as taoiseach. In a series of rallies last week, Ms McDonald said her party, the Greens and the Social Democrats capitalised on a mood for change at the recent general election.A senior Fianna Fáil TD said the talks could not drag on for months against the backdrop of the threat of the coronavirus and increased Brexit tensions.“We can’t have this charade going on,” the TD said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189800.1583132533!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pete buttigieg ends campaign as super tuesday beckons","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPete Buttigieg, former  Democratic presidential candidate, campaigning at a high school in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Saturday.  Photograph: New York TimesFormer Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg ended his presidential campaign on Sunday night, in a major reconfiguration of the Democratic race to become the party’s nominee.The 38 year-old veteran - the first openly gay candidate to run for the Democratic nomination - confirmed he was suspending his campaign in his home town of South Bend.“Today is a moment of truth,” he said. “The truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy if not for our cause.“I will no longer seek to be the 2020 nominee for president, but I will do everything in my power to ensure that we have a new Democratic president come January,” he said, to cheers of “2024, 2024.”While he did not endorse a candidate, he called for a “broad and inclusive politics… that is the way forward for our eventual nominee,” a comment broadly seen as a reference to the centrist politics represented by candidates such as former vice president Joe Biden.Mr Buttigieg had entered the race last year as a relative political unknown, but mounted a strong campaign, culminating with his victory in the Iowa caucus last month.But on Saturday in the fourth primary of the season, he ended in fourth place in South Carolina, polling particularly poorly among African-American voters.His departure from the campaign comes just before tomorrow’s Super Tuesday contest when more than a dozen states will choose their candidate to take on Donald Trump in November.‘Firewall’On Saturday, former vice president Joe Biden secured a huge boost after he surged to victory in the South Carolina primary.Mr Biden, who has long argued that the southern state would be his “firewall,” clocked up a better-than-expected victory in the state, clinching almost 50 per cent of the vote.The strong performance by the former vice president has imbued his campaign with a much-needed lift as the Democratic campaign enters a decisive phase with 14 states and one US territory due to vote tomorrow.South Carolina – the fourth state to hold its selection process after Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – also has the largest African-American population of the early-voting states. Some 56 per cent of voters in South Carolina on Saturday were African-Americans, with 61 per cent of this cohort voting for Mr Biden. The former vice president won every county in the state, indicating the breadth of his support in South Carolina.Speaking to supporters in Columbia, Mr Biden thanked the voters of South Carolina for backing him. “Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead,” he declared. “Now thanks to all of you - the heart of the Democratic party - we’ve just won and we won big because of you, and we are very much alive.”He also made a barely-veiled dig at front runner Bernie Sanders, asserting that Americans did not want a revolution but instead wanted “results.”“If Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us,” he said to cheers. “We have the option of winning big or losing big. That’s the choice.”Super TuesdayMr Biden’s commanding victory now puts him close behind Mr Sanders in the Democratic race. But he faces a tough battle on Tuesday when more than a third of all delegates are up for grabs.Polling suggests that Mr Sanders is on course to win California - the largest state in the union with a coveted 415 pledged delegates – and possibly Texas, though Mr Biden has been polling better in the state and is due to campaign there on Monday.Mr Biden is also polling relatively well in southern states voting on Tuesday such as Virginia and Alabama.Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman who finished in third place at 11 per cent in South Carolina having invested millions in the state in advertising, suspended his campaign on Saturday night, stating that he could not see a path forward to the nomination. He has not yet endorsed another candidate.Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertisements, was not on the ballot in South Carolina but is contesting Super Tuesday states – the results will offer the first indication of his level of support in the country. Mr Bloomberg was due to air a new primetime three-minute ad addressing his ability to deal with the coronavirus yesterday, the latest in a series of polished TV and online ads devised by his campaign.Mr Biden’s resolute victory on Saturday in South Carolina could underscore his argument that he is the best person to take on Mr Sanders.The Vermont senator, who won the nomination contests in New Hampshire, Nevada, and the popular vote in Iowa, responded to his second-place showing in South Carolina at a rally in Virginia, one of the Super Tuesday states. Mr Sanders’ surge in the first three primary states had sparked alarm among many on the moderate side of the Democratic party that the high number of candidates is effectively splitting the non-Sanders vote.“There are a lot of states in this country.

And in Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hinted at border closures in the event that Greece failed to keep the crowds at bay.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, has long threatened to let refugees into Europe if they don\u0027t meet his demands. His latest move marks the most serious escalation in his attempts to secure more help from Europe and Nato in tackling the refugee crisis in Syria, where almost a million have fled war in Idlib province in recent weeks.   In a speech on Saturday Mr Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, claimed that 18,000 people had amassed on the border and threatened to send a further 30,000.But in reality the number of people gathered at the main crossing, near the Turkish city of Edirne, appeared no higher than 5,000, while in nearby Ipsala a Turkish police officer said around 500 people had arrived.In what may soon become a sprawling refugee camp unless the crowds are dispersed by Turkish forces, women and children huddled around fires, masking their faces from the smoke.Rumours swirled at the border on Saturday about Turkish authorities transporting most of the migrants back to Istanbul at the end of the weekend, should Mr Erdogan feel his point has been made.The majority of those gathered in Edirne were young men, who angrily shouted at the Greek soldiers guarding their side of the border, behind a barbed-wire fence that stretched as far as the eye could see in each direction.Further south, dozens of migrants were attempting sea crossings to the Greek island of Lesbos in dinghies, with limited success.Some migrants claimed they had been beaten by Greek police, and that in at least one incident those who tried to cross into the EU had their shoes confiscated.Others told the Sunday  of their devastation as they realised they had been duped were now trapped at the border, Many who were unable to board free buses have resorted to paying taxi drivers around 100 lira (£12) and claim they are now out of money.Some migrants rode in on the back of pickup trucks driven by locals hoping to make some easy cash. Meanwhile, a group of taxi drivers bartered with migrants at a crossing near the Turkish town of Ipsala for transport back to Istanbul, after they gave up on entering Europe.Abdullah, an 18-year-old Afghan who came to Turkey with his five siblings six months ago, said they felt their hearts leap as they were waved across the Turkish side of the border, only to be greeted with barbed wire, soldiers and tear gas at the Greek side.We are devastated...we haven\u0027t even tried to cross again because we are too scared. One group today came back without any shoes, cell phones or bags. They were confiscated by the Greek police, he said.They lied to us, they said we could leave and now we are trapped here. We just want to go back to Ankara now but we don\u0027t have the money. I have no idea what to do.One Iranian refugee who said he was fleeing the theocracy in Tehran accused Mr Erdogan of ensuring him and his friends in a cruel political game, while two women from Somalia said they were ready to go back to Istanbul.Most of the people gathered at the border did not appear to have arrived from Syria\u0027s war-torn Idlib province, as they said they had already lived in Turkey without social security or ID cards for more than a year.We have been waiting for four years for this chance and now we are stuck here because the other side is closed, added an 18-year-old from Kabul who gave his name as Hourshid.We have jobs in Turkey but we left them to come here. Now I guess we have to go back.Since 2016, under the terms of the EU-Turkey migration deal, Ankara has been halting refugee flows towards the EU, which in turn agreed to give Turkey €3billion (£2.3 billion) and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens.Josep Borrell Fontelles, the EU\u0027s foreign policy chief, has said that the Turkish government has offered “reassurances” that Turkey intends to continue abiding by that agreement, even though its side of the border has been thrown open.As groups continued to arrive at Edirne on Saturday evening, Turkey continued to pile pressure on Western leaders for more military support on Syria and used the threat of more migration waves into Europe as a key bargaining chip.Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, said the government has urged the United States to provide Patriot missiles as backup in northwestern Syria, following Syrian regime airstrikes this month which killed 55 Turkish soldiers.The Turkish president also called on Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to step aside in Syria and allow Turkish forces to battle the Syrian regime alone.As night fell on Edirne, yet more migrants began to realise they had been duped as part of a cynical geopolitical game.As they trudged back through no-man\u0027s-land, they passed the sign in Turkish which had greeted them 24 hours earlier, when they were filled with false hope of safe passage to Europe.Turkey\u0027s border is its honour, the sign says.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"anglicans believe gay couples have right marry yougov poll suggests","story":"The number of Anglicans who believe that gay couples have a right to marry “are now clearly in the majority”, according to a new YouGov poll.Despite the Church of England’s official stance against same-sex relationships, almost half of Anglicans now believe that same sex marriage is right, with well over two-thirds of those aged 50 and under agreeing. The figures have prompted accusations that the Church of England is “kicking the can down the road” regarding attitudes to the LGBT community. The 2020 poll was commissioned by the Ozanne Foundation, which works with religious organisations around the world to eliminate discrimination and prejudice based on sexuality and gender. Jayne Ozanne, the Foundation’s director and a prominent gay evangelical within the Church of England – who had also commissioned the previous 2016 You Gov poll said: “These results show that those opposed to same-sex marriage are now clearly in the minority.”The results also show the huge mismatch between the Church of England\u0027s leadership and those who worship in our churches. “This is deeply worrying for the future of our Church.  Attitudes are changing fast, yet the Church of England appears to remain intransigent on a matter that is affecting the lives of so many of its LGBT+ members, their families and friends.  “What is more, younger Anglicans - often found within evangelical churches - are overwhelmingly clear where they stand on this issue, with nearly three quarters of the under 50s now believing in same sex marriage.  “The Church of England cannot afford to ‘kick the can down the road’ any longer, and needs to urgently agree a way forward so that those who wish to embrace and celebrate same sex marriages can do so.Ms Ozanne added: “To pretend that this is an issue on which many have not yet formed a view is to misunderstand the reality of what is happening in our pews.”For decades, the church has been ided over how to deal with LGBT issues and has recently embarked on a large study of human sexuality, Living in Love and Faith, which is due to be published later this year.The YouGov research surveyed attitudes amongst 5169 people in total across Great Britain, including 1,171 Anglicans in England.The figures come just a weeks after the Archbishops apologised for the House of Bishops’ recent “pastoral statement” on civil partnerships, which condemned sex outside heterosexual marriage. Towards the end of January, the Church of England stated that civil partnerships should be no more than “sexually abstinent friendships”. The guidance sparked furious criticism from LGBT campaigners both within and outside the church and prompted almost 4,000 people to sign an open letter to the Archbishops, organised by Ms Ozanne and three other Church of England members, that stated the “Church had become a laughing-stock to the nation”.Commenting on the YouGov poll results Rt Revd Paul Bayes, the Bishop of Liverpool and Chair ofthe Foundation, said: “These results provide a challenge to us in leadership within the Church of England to ensure that we understand the views of the people we serve. “Attitudes are indeed changing quickly, and we must be open to what the Holy Spirit is saying to us through them if we are to be an effective witness of God’s love to the nation.”A spokesperson for the Church of England added: “We know that there is disagreement in the Church of England over the question of same-sex marriage.“That is why we are preparing a major new set of teaching and learning resources that will help the Church to understand this question in the wider context of identity, sexuality and marriage.“We hope the resources will enable people in the Church of England to think more deeply about these matters and so to understand the differences among us better.  We do this because the Church values everyone, regardless of their convictions, as a person loved and made in the image of God.“By learning from and listening to one another, guided by Holy Spirit, the Church will find ways forward rooted in scripture and the Christian faith.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/01/TELEMMGLPICT000226360796_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwd_IMXDuG20-9jzaA0wHyVc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pandemics data security globalisation means must resilient","story":"Pandemics like Covid-19 are just one of many threats that we must be better prepared forBehind the scenes in Whitehall, ministers and officials routinely wargame scenarios that most of us prefer not to think about. Marauding firearms attacks, 911-style plane hijacks, and global pandemics are just some of the crises for which the exercises are designed to prepare ministers and officials.The details, when they leak, can sound scary. But the fact that governments test decisions like the distribution of scarce drugs and have plans for makeshift morgues should be reassuring, rather than a cause for alarm. The details of particular exercises depend on the hypothetical scenario being tested – which is often the worst imaginable – and mean little for how a real terror attack might play out, or how coronavirus will spread.The exercises do mean, however, that ministers and officials – including the agencies responsible for operations on the ground – are more likely to be ready when an emergency comes. And, of course, experience teaches us that emergencies happen. Our circumstances change, and the nature of the dangers we face evolves, but life is inevitably and inherently about coping with risk. Somehow, this is something we have forgotten. When the Cold War ended, the danger of nuclear strikes appeared to fade. The risk of ethnic, ideological or interests-driven conflict between states also seemed to diminish. The common assumption was that liberal democracy had triumphed, the nations and peoples of the world would grow more alike, and we were living in a peaceful “new world order”. Science, reason and the market would ensure we would grow healthier and more prosperous.Yet with the rise of China, a revanchist Russia, rogue states like Iran and North Korea, and aggressive non-state organisations like al-Qaeda and Isil, this complacency has already proved misplaced.And we face new dangers, too. As our lives and economies become more dependent on digital technologies, we are increasingly reliant on the resilience and security of the systems – and the ethics, goodwill and cooperation of their owners – that provide them.The interconnected nature of the world economy means we are more exposed than ever to decisions made by foreign governments, financiers and business leaders. When Chinese growth falters, for example, the knock-on effects for the world economy will be severe.And there are other risks associated with globalisation. As the European migration crisis showed, in the modern world huge movements of people are possible. The decisions made by foreign leaders – like Angela Merkel in 2015, or Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week opened Turkey’s border with Greece – can cause grave consequences for many countries other than their own.As coronavirus is proving, the scale of international travel means viruses can be difficult to contain. Of course, Covid-19 appears to be especially contagious, and it was obvious from an early stage that there was little chance of containing it in Wuhan or even China. But its spread is likely to be even faster, thanks to Beijing’s initial response, and the incompetence and secrecy of states such as Iran.Then there is climate change. It is doubtful that global carbon emissions can be reduced quickly enough and at sufficient scale to prevent our climate changing, whatever Britain decides to do unilaterally. Heathrow might not be allowed one extra runway, but India and China are each planning to build hundreds of new airports in the next 10 years. And their overall emissions – which dwarf ours – will go on rising. As our climate changes and extreme weather becomes more common, we need to become better prepared to handle sudden events such as floods and storms as well as the longer-term change in our environment.So just as the Government prepares for what it calls “civil contingencies”, it needs to get better at preparing the public for the inevitability of unfortunate events. It needs to work out what role it can play in leading improvements in international institutions and cooperation. And it needs to assess whether its policies strike the right balance between prevention and preparation.Ministers were sensible, for example, to avoid overreacting to the initial spread of coronavirus. If they had prematurely ordered schools to shut down, there would have been an immediate and unnecessary blow to the economy as parents stayed at home to look after their children. But the experience of Covid-19 so far has already exposed important questions.The first stage of the Department of Health’s strategy is “containment”, yet direct flights from China to Britain were allowed to continue at the height of the contagion. Government travel advice for British nationals heading to affected regions has on occasion been contradictory and confusing.Nobody should expect the NHS constantly to operate at over-capacity for fear of a sudden surge in patients, but the Nuffield Trust has pointed out that there is “little fuel in the tank” should patient numbers spike. Ministers need to find ways of scaling up and down capacity according to the severity of a health crisis.British researchers are playing their part in the global effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, but Britain has no vaccine manufacturing plants. If and when a vaccine is discovered, experts have warned that we will need to wait in the queue to get it.As a country that prides itself on its adherence to international free trade, the UK has long been content for its companies to take their place in transnational supply chains. But with coronavirus, as with our new 5G telecommunications system – which ministers insist we can only build with the help of the Chinese company, Huawei – we may come to rue the lack of a national, or at least Western, capability to produce what we need. Countries have strategic necessities that can trump the purity of the market.This is just one lesson we need to learn if we want to improve our resilience. Global interdependency brings great advantages but new risks. We must get ourselves accustomed to living with these risks and, from new international institutions to reserved national capabilities, we have to do more to prevent and protect ourselves from harm.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

We have had to have quite honest conversations. She was worried because she is asthmatic.”Another of the coronavirus cases identified over the weekend - in Gloucestershire - involved a member of staff at St Mary’s primary school in Tetbury. A letter to parents from the headteacher, Jo Woolley, said “all people who have been in contact with the person” had been contacted and told to exclude themselves from school.A second case of the virus in Gloucestershire, revealed yesterday, was said to be linked. A secondary school in the east of Ireland was similarly forced to close after pupils and teachers were in contact with a man suffering from coronavirus.As Britain steeled itself to respond to a major outbreak, plans to call upon retired doctors and nurses were dealt a blow after health experts warned that older people were at far greater risk from coronavirus. The average 2 per cent death rate was found to soar to 15 per cent for the over 80s, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Jonathan Leach, Honorary Secretary of the Royal College of GPs, told the : “Retired healthcare professionals have a huge amount to offer the health service, and many would do so willingly, but any drafting in of their skills to help deal with Covid-19 would need to be their choice and with their full understanding of the situation and any associated risks, and that every effort is made to ensure they are protected.”Heightened anxiety over the arrival of a potential pandemic to the UK has also led to a spike in stockpiling measures from food companies relying on Italian produce. Warehouses are being filled with at least two months’ worth of supplies such as pasta, mozzarella and pesto amid fears Italy could impose a limit on foreign exports. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off

with Sketch.The hit Netflix show’s creator Peter Morgan takes plenty of artistic licence with this historical drama. But eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a mistake in the trailer for the third season. When Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II is shown celebrating her 1977 Silver Jubilee, the voiceover gets the date of the Queen’s coronation wrong by a year, saying the Silver jubilee was 25 years after the Coronation. It was actually 24 years, as her coronation took place on June 2, 1953.  The ITV fish-out-of-water detective drama stars Rob Lowe as a US police chief who moves to the UK to take up the role of Chief Constable with East Lincolnshire police. He wears four medal ribbons – Diamond Jubilee Medal, Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen\u0027s Police Medal and Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The trouble is not only are they in the wrong order, but he shouldn’t be wearing any of them. He’s an American who hasn’t previously served in the British police.Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) states that his sister Samantha was abducted by aliens but his recollections of it are contradictory. During hypnotherapy regression therapy, he says he was unable to move at the time, but during flashbacks, he is perfectly able to do so. Mulder is also seen wearing a wedding ring in the season five episode “Travellers. Why had he never mentioned being married? In reality, Duchovny had recently got married. But it added a big change to Mulder’s past.How old is the Doctor? In the classic-era he states he’s anywhere between 500 to several thousand years old. But in the revived series, David Tennant’s Doctor claims he is 904 years old. Unless he’s lying, somewhere along the line, the continuity has slipped up.During Ralphie’s death scene in his kitchen, Tony Soprano is almost blinded by a can of spray, but knocks Ralphie to the floor and kills him. The scene was meant to end with Tony putting his hands on the counter and gasping for air but James Gandolfini, who brilliantly plays Tony, accidentally put his hand down on the oven’s lit burners. The cry of pain was real – but this mistake worked perfectly for the scene.622 Game of Thrones The greatest oops moment in GoT’s was in the final season when a stray Starbucks cup is sitting on a wooden table next to Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys Targaryen. Did nobody spot it? There were also plastic water bottles near Samwell Tarly’s and Ser Davos’s feet in the final episode.When Marge tells Homer she is pregnant with Maggie in the episode “And Maggie Makes Three”, which first aired in 1995, a picture of Maggie can be seen hanging on the wall of the living room – a right clanger – considering this is before she is even born.The second season of the TV drama is set in October 1984 – a year after the first season. Considering the show trades in nostalgia, you would have thought they\u0027d get the soundtrack right – but they didn’t. Mistakes include The Smith\u0027s song There is a Light That Never Goes Out playing in the background during a flashback between Will and Jonathan. Trouble is, this particular Smiths song wasn\u0027t released until 1986. There was also a motoring error: Barb\u0027s Volkswagon Cabrio was actually made in 1988. In the first season’s episode Provenance, it seems that the actors got a bit lazy, referring to characters by their real names, not their character’s name. Dean appears to call his brother “Jared”, when the character’s name is Sam Winchester and an extra calls the character Dean Winchester “Jensen”, which is again the name of the actor who plays him. It’s one of those shows in which fans searched for hidden clues and meanings. But they picked up on more than intended. In the plane crash scene in the first episode, right before the turbine explodes, a mysterious dark object sweeps upwards only visible to fans sifting through the scene frame by frame. Was it an early manifestation of the smoke monster? No, according to producers, it was just a CGI error.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom. The aspiring actress Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, refers to her dad as “Bob”, but once he’s introduced on the show, he is called “Wyatt”. Also there is a plot mistake regarding the broken elevator in the apartment building. When they lug the time machine up the stairs in season one, Leonard explains to Howard that the elevator has been broken for two years. But Howard should know this considering he was there when Leonard blew it up. This is revealed during a flash back in a later episode, where it also states that the event took place five years ago, not two.The BBC hit drama had a continuity error when its star Suranne Jones is seen drinking a glass of wine in her kitchen. As she gulps the wine and texts from her phone, the fridge door in the background is open, then closed, then open – all by itself.1322 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season one establishes that vampires have no breath – it\u0027s confirmed when Angel is unable to perform CPR. But the vampires talk, pant and even smoke – all which require breathing – while Spike is even tortured by drowning.During a scene in season nine, episode 15 (“The One with the Mugging”), Jennifer Aniston was replaced with a stand-in while her character Rachel was still in shot. She sits at the table at the edge of the frame and is even wearing a different top. In another scene, Phoebe, is chatting to her friend  Monica, but it’s not Monica. It’s Courteney Cox’s body double who has been left carelessly in the shot.Fans laughed out loud when Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) finds Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) injured on the pavement and picks up her mobile to call emergency services. She managed to do it without touching the screen, unlocking her phone or dialling any numbers.1622 Malcolm in the MiddleIn the US sitcom about a dysfunctional family, when Lois walks out holding her ruined dress that is soaking wet to confront her kids, there is a crew member crouching in the hallway holding a bucket.The heartthrob paediatrician Doug Ross, played by George Clooney, had a son prior to his romance with Carol – or did he? Although he mentions the son a few times in season one, he claims later in the series not to have any children.In the first episode of this sci-fi series, the steering wheel has disappeared from the set of the spaceship. Serenity’s pilot Wash, played by Alan Tudyk, can be seen improvising with his hands around an imaginary wheel. It’s hard to believe this mistake wasn’t caught.The mistake actually ended up changing the plot of the series. Supposedly, David Lynch accidentally caught the crew member Frank Silva on camera when his reflection appeared in a mirror in a scene when Laura Palmer was shown screaming. Lynch liked it so much that he decided to keep it in and cast Silva as the character Killer Bob, a dark spirit who haunts Laura.2022 Two and a Half Men Charlie Sheen is seen talking on an upside down iPhone while sitting in a flash red car with a sexily clad woman next to him.The whopper of a mistake did not happen on screen, but in a promotional shot posted online. It was a surprise to see a plastic water bottle perched on the mantle piece behind the Earl of Grantham and Lady Edith considering the series is set in the 1920s. Other mistakes onscreen include a TV aerial on top of a house and double yellow lines on the road.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom. The aspiring actress Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, refers to her dad as “Bob”, but once he’s introduced on the show, he is called “Wyatt”. Also there is a plot mistake regarding the broken elevator in the apartment building. When they lug the time machine up the stairs in season one, Leonard explains to Howard that the elevator has been broken for two years. But Howard should have known this considering he was there when Leonard blew it up. This is revealed during a flash back in a later episode, where it states the event took place five years ago, not two.The hit Netflix show’s creator Peter Morgan takes plenty of artistic licence with this historical drama. But eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a mistake in the trailer for the third season. When Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II is shown celebrating her 1977 Silver Jubilee, the voiceover gets the date of the Queen’s coronation wrong by a year, saying the Silver jubilee was 25 years after the Coronation. It was actually 24 years, as her coronation took place on June 2, 1953.  The ITV fish-out-of-water detective drama stars Rob Lowe as a US police chief who moves to the UK to take up the role of Chief Constable with East Lincolnshire police. He wears four medal ribbons – Diamond Jubilee Medal, Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen\u0027s Police Medal and Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The trouble is not only are they in the wrong order, but he shouldn’t be wearing any of them. He’s an American who hasn’t previously served in the British police.Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) states that his sister Samantha was abducted by aliens but his recollections of it are contradictory. During hypnotherapy regression therapy, he says he was unable to move at the time, but during flashbacks, he is perfectly able to do so. Mulder is also seen wearing a wedding ring in the season five episode “Travellers. Why had he never mentioned being married? In reality, Duchovny had recently got married. But it added a big change to Mulder’s past.How old is the Doctor? In the classic-era he states he’s anywhere between 500 to several thousand years old. But in the revived series, David Tennant’s Doctor claims he is 904 years old. Unless he’s lying, somewhere along the line, the continuity has slipped up.During Ralphie’s death scene in his kitchen, Tony Soprano is almost blinded by a can of spray, but knocks Ralphie to the floor and kills him. The scene was meant to end with Tony putting his hands on the counter and gasping for air but James Gandolfini, who brilliantly plays Tony, accidentally put his hand down on the oven’s lit burners. The cry of pain was real – but this mistake worked perfectly for the scene.622 Game of Thrones The greatest oops moment in GoT’s was in the final season when a stray Starbucks cup is sitting on a wooden table next to Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys Targaryen. Did nobody spot it? There were also plastic water bottles near Samwell Tarly’s and Ser Davos’s feet in the final episode.When Marge tells Homer she is pregnant with Maggie in the episode “And Maggie Makes Three”, which first aired in 1995, a picture of Maggie can be seen hanging on the wall of the living room – a right clanger – considering this is before she is even born.The second season of the TV drama is set in October 1984 – a year after the first season. Considering the show trades in nostalgia, you would have thought they\u0027d get the soundtrack right – but they didn’t. Mistakes include The Smith\u0027s song There is a Light That Never Goes Out playing in the background during a flashback between Will and Jonathan. Trouble is, this particular Smiths song wasn\u0027t released until 1986. There was also a motoring error: Barb\u0027s Volkswagon Cabrio was actually made in 1988. In the first season’s episode Provenance, it seems that the actors got a bit lazy, referring to characters by their real names, not their character’s name. Dean appears to call his brother “Jared”, when the character’s name is Sam Winchester and an extra calls the character Dean Winchester “Jensen”, which is again the name of the actor who plays him. It’s one of those shows in which fans searched for hidden clues and meanings. But they picked up on more than intended. In the plane crash scene in the first episode, right before the turbine explodes, a mysterious dark object sweeps upwards only visible to fans sifting through the scene frame by frame. Was it an early manifestation of the smoke monster? No, according to producers, it was just a CGI error.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom.

As she gulps the wine and texts from her phone, the fridge door in the background is open, then closed, then open – all by itself.1322 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season one establishes that vampires have no breath – it\u0027s confirmed when Angel is unable to perform CPR. But the vampires talk, pant and even smoke – all which require breathing – while Spike is even tortured by drowning.During a scene in season nine, episode 15 (“The One with the Mugging”), Jennifer Aniston was replaced with a stand-in while her character Rachel was still in shot. She sits at the table at the edge of the frame and is even wearing a different top. In another scene, Phoebe, is chatting to her friend  Monica, but it’s not Monica. It’s Courteney Cox’s body double who has been left carelessly in the shot.Fans laughed out loud when Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) finds Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) injured on the pavement and picks up her mobile to call emergency services. She managed to do it without touching the screen, unlocking her phone or dialling any numbers.1622 Malcolm in the MiddleIn the US sitcom about a dysfunctional family, when Lois walks out holding her ruined dress that is soaking wet to confront her kids, there is a crew member crouching in the hallway holding a bucket.The heartthrob paediatrician Doug Ross, played by George Clooney, had a son prior to his romance with Carol – or did he? Although he mentions the son a few times in season one, he claims later in the series not to have any children.In the first episode of this sci-fi series, the steering wheel has disappeared from the set of the spaceship.

The UK\u0027s blue-chip index of large companies briefly touched a three-and-a-half year low, before rallying to partially recoup\u0026nbspsome of the day\u0027s losses.Among the biggest fallers was International Airlines Group (IAG), the owner of\u0026nbspBritish Airways,\u0026nbspwhich saw its shares tank after warning that the Covid-19\u0026nbspvirus\u0026nbsphad caused a drop in demand for flights.

It has since been suggested that they may instead be formed by flowing sand NasaJPLUniversity of ArizonaMorning Aurora: Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this photograph of the green lights of the aurora from the International Space Station in October 2015Earlier this week, the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center\u0026nbspannounced\u0026nbsp the object had been given the designation\u0026nbsp2020 CD3.Many speculated the object was a rocky asteroid, which would make it only the second natural satellite to be spotted around the Earth, other than the Moon. The only other similar object was spotted in 2006 and has since left its orbit around the Earth.Earth has a new ‘minimoon’, scientists announceThe newly discovered satellite will also leave Earth’s orbit, in the coming months, leaving\u0026nbspastronomers scrambling to get images of the object and understand its origin.“Obtaining the images was a scramble for the Gemini team because the object is quickly becoming fainter as it moves away from Earth. It is expected to be ejected from Earth’s orbit altogether in April,” said John Blakeslee, head of science at the international Gemini Observatory, which was responsible for the new images.In the picture, the object can be seen glowing at the centre, with stars streaking across because the telescope was moving to track the object as it moved around the Earth.The image was taken on 24 February, soon after\u0026nbsp2020\u0026nbspCD3 was first spotted.Astronomers hope to get more images of the object, in an attempt to learn more about it.They will look in particular to understand how bright it is shining and how much light it reflects – if it is especially dim, then it is likely to be a rocky body, but if it is shining brighter it is more likely to be a reflective piece of debris, such as a used rocket booster.“Additional observations to refine its position will help us determine this mystery object’s orbit and its possible origin,” he said.Astronomers expect to find many more such objects as new ways of observing them come online.The Gemini Observatory is part of the\u0026nbspNSF’s\u0026nbspNational Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, which is currently preparing the\u0026nbspVera C\u0026nbspRubin Observatory, which will scan the sky of seeing yet more similar objects.“We expect to find a population of these objects once the Rubin Observatory is operational,” said Mr Fedorets\u0026nbspin a statement. “Stay tuned!”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These include anyone waiting for coronavirus test results, anyone who has come\u0026nbspinto contact with a confirmed infected person, and anyone returning from a country significantly disrupted by the virus.Instead of sending staff home, PHE recommends that if a workplace has a confirmed case of the virus then they\u0026nbspshould wait to be contacted by a local Health Protection Team to discuss and determine what measures, if any, should be taken.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: Cases soar of deadly new flu-like virus Show all 154Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

This could include an adequate data plan on a mobile device that allows you to hotspot an internet connection wirelessly from your phone or tablet.Space images show drastic drop in China pollution as coronavirus hitsIf connecting to a work\u0026nbspserver meant only for internal use, it may be necessary to set up a virtual private network (VPN) in order to access it.\u0026nbspVPNs\u0026nbspand anti-malware software are also advisable for anyone using a\u0026nbspWiFi\u0026nbspnetwork they do not control, such as in a cafe or co-working space, however this should not be an issue for anyone in quarantine.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Time-management apps like RescueTume can help you stick to your schedule and maintain your regular hours.​What are your rights and will you still get paid?Any staff who have been asked to self-isolate are entitled to take the time as sick leave, according to health secretary Matt Hancock. He added that self-isolation should be considered “sickness for employment purposes”.How much pay a worker receives will depend on their contract, with most employers offering a certain number of sick days on full pay.Even if employers do not offer sick pay, workers are entitled to\u0026nbsp statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. It amounts to £94.25 per week and is paid from the fourth day of sickness.Those hardest hit will be anyone who is self-employed or who work in the gig economy, who are not entitled to SSP\u0026nbspif they self-isolate. The Department for Work and Pensions has said that anyone deemed a public health risk could claim universal credit or contributory employment and support allowance.​Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Under proportional systems, tactical voting is far less of an issue: what you vote for is what you get.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone after election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesThe organisation suggested that for Labour, the concentration of the party’s vote in certain areas meant that it took on average 50,835 votes to return a Labour MP — compared to 38,264 for a Tory MP.The report added: “This vote concentration is also seen in the top 10 largest majorities, nine of which are Labour seats, where parties pile up votes with securing real representation.“While the Conservative party is benefiting from Westminster’s voting system across the UK as a whole, in Scotland, a substantial Conservative vote share (25.1 per cent) yielded just six sears (10.2 per cent).”\u0026nbspThe ERS added that smaller parties were “penalised” by the current system, despite an increase in vote share on 2017 in the first December election in almost a century.Labour leadership hopefuls urged push for proportional representationThere can be no moderate politics in Brexit Britain without PRThree-quarters of Labour members want proportional representationThe left should be fighting for proportional representationSmall parties urged to make electoral reform a coalition red line“Smaller parties contesting seats spread across the whole of Great Britain — the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and Brexit Party — continue to lose out,” the report said. “For the Liberal Democrats, an 11.5 per cent vote share across Britain resulted in just 1.6 per cent of the Commons seats.”\u0026nbspDr Jess Garland, the director of research and policy at the ERS, said: “It is no wonder trust in politics is at rock bottom the vast majority of people’s votes are being systematically ignored by a voting system that is morally and politically bankrupt.\u0026nbsp“Westminster cannot go on like this — all parties must get behind reform of this broken system at long last. It’s time Westminster caught up with the rest of the UK and ensures seats in parliament reflect how people actually want to vote.\u0026nbsp“No more ‘holding your nose’ tactical votes, ignored votes and warped results.

It can be a little eerie, a little frightening.As well as about half a metre of ice plastered to his house, Mr Mis said his backyard was even worse, covered more than three metres thick of frozen water.Although the ice coverings are remarkable to look at, some inhabitants of the winter wonderland are concerned about possible damage to their homes.We\u0027re worried about the integrity, of structure failure when it starts to melt, because of the weight on the roof, Mr Mis said.It\u0027s a beautiful sight, but I don\u0027t want to live through it again.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And so we must recognise that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our nation together, he said.

His campaign then quietly announced a detour to Indiana, where he confirmed his decision to step aside.In a statement earlier to The Independent, the campaign said that Mr Buttigieg believes this is the right thing to do for our country, for our party and for Americans across the country eager to heal our ided nation, defeat this president and work to fix our broken politics.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFiveThirtyEight predicts Mr Sanders has the best chance to win the state. He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize. California, the country’s most populous state, has 415 pledged delegates and 79 superdelegates up for grabs.California’s Democratic voters are 50 per cent white, 26 per cent Hiic, 15 per cent Asian, eight per cent black and one percent other races.\u0026nbspCensus information from 2016 shows that 17 percent of the state is over the age of 65, just under the national average of 19 percent. The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates. Every other candidate is at risk of falling under the 15 per cent viability threshold. The closest runner up, Mr Biden, is only expected to win an average of 17 percent of the vote and an average of 83 delegates.

The UK has strong defence ties with Oman, with\u0026nbspBritish Special Forces carrying out annual exercises.\u0026nbspAt the same time, London is pushing for post-Brexit trade in the Gulf and has proposed an agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain as well as Saudi Arabia and Oman.The crisis over the spread of coronavirus is also likely to be discussed. Saudi Arabia has closed the two holiest shrines of Islam, Mecca and Medina, to foreign travellers following the outbreak, while Oman has banned entry to the country for nationals of Iran, which has seen a rising number of infections and deaths from the disease.Britain has condemned acts of human rights abuse in Saudi Arabia, such as the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and imprisonment of activists. But civil rights groups have charged the government with muting its criticism in order to get commercial deals after leaving the European Union.Western powers are protracting the war in Yemen for profitThe UK is the penholder for Yemen in the UN Security Council, a term designating\u0026nbspthree of the permanent members — France, UK, US — leadership role in certain situations. Yemen tops the watchlist of countries most likely to face humanitarian catastrophe in 2020. The long running conflict in which the Saudi- and Emirati-backed Yemeni government is fighting Houthi rebels means 24 million people, 80 per cent of the population, will need urgent assistance this year, according to aid agencies.Mr Raab said ahead of his visit that he will also seek to push for a political solution following the recent surge in Houthi violence and constraints on getting humanitarian aid to those in need.He continued “The Gulf is important to UK security, but it’s also a region of enormous opportunity. Both Oman and Saudi Arabia want to grow in sectors such as health, education and culture where the UK leads the world. I look forward to discussing trade, regional security, climate change and human rights in this pivotal region.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His chief rival ex-army chief Benny Gantz, who heads the Blue and White party,\u0026nbspwas also unable to sweep a majority of the 120-seat parliament.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Netanyahu has also been formally indicted in three cases on graft charges he has vehemently and repeatedly denied.The impasse has meant for the last year Israel has been led by a caretaker government that cannot pass a budget or certain laws bringing the country to a political standstill.At the polling stations, there was growing voter anger over the stalemate.\u0026nbspCitizens said they feared the same inconclusive results as the April and September votes,\u0026nbspbecause the country remains bitterly ided.“I don’t know what the result will be, but I think it could be just like the last times,” said Nir Amsel, 45, a Blue and White\u0026nbspvoter from Tel Aviv.Jaded Israelis head to polls for third time in a year“I worry that people who are undecided will go with Netanyahu because they’re sick of the situation and believe that he has the best chance of forming a ruling coalition.”A fellow Blue and White\u0026nbspvoter\u0026nbspNoga Ratz, 63, added: This is already the third elections and our budget has run out and we don’t have a functioning government.\u0026nbspI want to have an Israel for the next generation so they won’t need to run away to live abroad, she said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If that fails, a fourth round of elections will likely be called.\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu is hoping to drum up last-minute support to nudge forward his bloc, with hardline Yamima and ultra-orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism.Mr Gantz is hoping to build a strong coalition with centre-left alliance of Labour, Meretz and Gisha parties.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Now they have been pushed back.”Sunday’s fast-moving developments came following the killing of at least 33 Turkish soldiers in a Syrian regime airstrike in Idlib province on Thursday. The attack prompted Ankara to dramatically escalate attacks on military forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and open its borders at Bulgaria and Greece to refugees yearning to head towards the west. \u0026nbspOn Sunday, Turkey claimed it downed two Russian-made Syrian regime fighter jets over the country’s opposition-controlled northwest and rendered useless a regime airbase near the town of Nayrab, according to Turkish media outlets. Damascus claimed it shot down a Turkish drone near the town of Saraqeb.\u0026nbspNeither claim could be independently verified.\u0026nbspHours later Damascus announced a no-fly zone over northern Syria, according to the official Sana news agency,\u0026nbsp a restriction it would be unable to enforce without Russia, its primary patron and military backer.\u0026nbspTurkey’s defence minister Halusi Akar on Sunday announced the launch of Operation Spring Shield, aimed at pushing back Assad’s forces from Turkey’s positions in Idlib.\u0026nbspTurkey and Russia tensions spike in SyriaUS military truck filmed ramming Russian jeep off the road in SyriaMasses of civilians flee regime bombs in Syria’s Idlib“We do not aim to have a face-off with Russia,” Mr Akar said. “Our aim is for the Syrian regime to stop massacres and to prevent radicalisation, migration.”\u0026nbspMr Akar said the Turkish offensive would entail targeting Assad regime assets that posed a threat to Turkish interests in northeast Syria.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could also spell more misery for millions of Syrians penned up in the country’s northwest hoping to get to western Europe. \u0026nbspMr Erdogan’s government has claimed it allowed 76,000 migrants and refugees to get across the border towards Greece and Bulgaria as a way of putting pressure on the European Union to address Syria and to deflect domestic attention away from the losses the conflict has entailed.Greek and Bulgarian authorities are reporting far fewer numbers attempting to cross and insist very few if any are successful in traversing the heavily guarded frontiers.“No one can cross the Greek borders,” said a text message sent out by Athens authorities. “All those attempting illegal entry are effectively prevented from entering.

Ministers need officials to deliver a thousand and one things.“And on top of the Brexit tasks there is also the day job of counter terrorism, organized crime, policing and drugs.”But Ms Patel’s allies last night retaliated to dub Sir Philip “a classic, old school establishment mandarin” who is overly cautious.One said: “He is very good at blocking things without saying it. It is never a flat out ‘no’, just lots of ‘ooh minister, that’s very courageous’”.One recent victory attributed to Sir Philip was to signicantly simply the new points-based immigration system, stripping it down from an original more complex plan.It can then be built on over time, once it is up and running and offering visas to businesses in the Autumn.One senior Home Office insider dubbed it “a big clash of cultures, a risk manager versus a radical reformer”.As well as the Home Office, the Departments for Transport and the Environment as well as HM Revenue and Customs are also under heavy strain.“Cracks will appear” in them too soon, it is predicted.Insiders say Government lawyers are under the most pressure of all because of the need to draft so much new legislation and treaty agreements, both with the EU and other countries.The Home Office last night refused to deny Sir Philip has issued warnings.Instead, a Home Office spokesman said: “The Home Secretary and Permanent Secretary are deeply concerned about the number of  allegations appearing in the media.“They are focused on delivering on the Home Office’s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Am I mad  Actually, I think I’m pretty sane, although I may be biased.I’ll explain my reasoning.My abstinence from clothes shopping is no big secret. I’ve mentioned it many times before but I guess in these times of impending climate doom it’s trendier now. The irony, not buying clothes is in fashion.It’s a bit like feminism.That used to be “those bra-burning crazy women”  but now it’s OK. Cool, in fact. Probably because we live in a much more “woke” society.It must be my Blue Peter upbringing. After all, I’m always saying Blue Peter was woke before woke was a thing — the appeals, growing produce in the greenhouse, making things, inclusivity, ersity. It was ahead of the game!Often we overcomplicate matters, overlooking the easy option. Take not buying more clothes, for example. It has so many advantages . . .❶ Keeping your old clothes is a good incentive to stick to the same weight. I pretty much stopped growing by age  so everything I’ve owned since then still fits. Plus I don’t really wear tight clothes either, so fluctuating by a few pounds here and there is OK.❷ I’m pretty lazy and the thought of having to go shopping for clothes feels like a big effort. Even buying online is hard work.What to buy  Will it fit  How do Iit  What a hassle. When I was younger, I liked to shop with friends. But that novelty wore off long ago.Now, as a mum, when I see friends all I want is to have good conversations.❸ Not being fashionable is liberating. You don’t have to hang out with people who judge you on what you wear. You can hang out with people that like you for you. When people glance me up and down to check out my rags, I have a secret sense of satisfaction that I no longer worry what they’re thinking.❹ It’s way cheaper to not buy stuff. Think of all the money you’ll save.❺ I won’t bang on about it but clothes, consumer goods and stuff in general in our society are becoming too dis­pos­able and our Earth can’t cope. We are having to get rid of all of it in landfill and it’s just not sustainable. It’s killing the planet.So it’s a no-brainer.The other day I was with a couple of like-minded friends and one commented on the other’s top.The other replied:  “It’s five years old from HM.” The first laughed, then said: “Mine’s seven years old from Florence And Fred, so there.”Maybe one day we will live in a world where people will judge on how OLD clothes are, rather than how new.So we’ll get to the point where something being “so last year” is a compliment.WHITNEY HOUSTON ed to our shores on Tuesday, hitting the stage in Sheffield in the opening leg of her  UK tour.When I say “”, she hasn’t come back from the afterle but is performing in the form of a hologram. How Black Mirror.Apparently it’s the next big thing, with all manner of stars being resurrected,  holographically speaking, to entertain us.But why stop at Elvis or Marilyn  The show’s organisers say: “A lot of artists get tired of the road at some point, where they have to go and touch their audiences to earn a living.

Yes, there have been more than , confirmed cases of coronavirus in more than  countries around the world.But in the UK, where more than , people have been tested, there have been  confirmed cases.To date, there have been no deaths in the UK from coronavirus and only one Brit — an elderly cruise ship passenger in Japan — has died in total.So when Covid- is routinely referred to as the “killer virus”, that is something less than the whole truth. Because most people unfortunate enough to catch it recover.Even in China, where there have been over , cases, the ­numbers of ­infection are slowing.Containing the virus works. As we edge closer to a full-blown pandemic, a little perspective will go a long way.As those Brit tourists locked inside the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenere would probably tell you, the greatest threat posed by the virus is massive inconvenience, not sudden death.If you are not old, and have no pre- existing medical conditions, then coronavirus is slightly more le-threatening than regular flu — which killed , Brits last year.Every doctor will tell you that hands are a route of transmission — so keep them clean, and take a rain-check on handshakes, manly hugs and social kissing.Professor Hugh Pennington, a ­lecturer in diseases at Aberdeen University, says, “Just using ordinary soap and water is all that’s needed.It can make all the dference and really limit the spread of this virus.”We should be thinking about ­better personal hygiene rather than panic buying.I am not making the case for complacency. The world is facing the greatest health crisis for a ­generation.This week the first cases were seen in countries as far apart as Pakistan, Greece, Brazil, Nigeria and Wales.The cancelled sporting events are piling up. Schools are closing. The stock market is in freefall. This is not normal le.Personally, I am not getting on a plane until my daughter is the far side of her exams in the spring.My local gym has installed hand sanitisers and I use them.When I see someone coughing, I wish they had the common decency to cover their cakehole.But every one of us must walk the hard path between staying safe and staying sane.The Government’s worst-case scenario predicts half-a-million British deaths from the virus — which would exceed the number of British military and civilian deaths in World War Two.Is Covid- REALLY deadlier than living through — and fighting in — World War Two The Government should ditch the scare stories and tell us how to stay healthy. They should keep repeating how simple personal hygiene habits can contain the spread of Covid-.Keep calm, carry on and wash your hands.For as any doctor will tell you, there is nothing more contagious than panic.ANA De Armas is doing the heavy lting in promoting the new Bond film, No Time To Die.In the last week alone, Ana has appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair and Porter magazines. What’s lovely about the Cuban goddess is that she actually seems happy to be in a James Bond movie.“I was jumping all over the place and very excited,” she says about getting her role as CIA agent Paloma.In stark contrast, it is hard to imagine grumpy old Daniel Craig jumping with excitement at anything to do with the Bond franchise.“I don’t even call them Bond girls,” grumbles downbeat Dan.It’s like having Victor Meldew playing .DAVID Dimbleby, the nearest thing the BBC has to royalty, claims that: “The whole idea of a national broadcaster that speaks truth to the nation and is impartial and objective is under threat.”But whose fault is that Millions of us blame the BBC. Because during the great national debate about Brexit, the BBC was openly, unapologetically biased.The orthodoxy of BBC opinion is totally out of touch with the people who fork out the £billion a year for the licence fee.For years the BBC told those people that they are thick, ignorant racists who would all soon be dead.If the BBC had been “impartial and objective” in recent years, it would not be ripe for losing the licence fee.Prince Harry and the Queen have always seemed close.And in a family that is not big on displays of affection, the Queen’s face always seemed to light up in her grandson’s cheeky, ginger-bonce presence.But his North American exile means Harry will now see far less of his grandmother,  this April.If Harry has an IQ bigger than Meghan’s shoe size, I bet he will live to regret it.STORM Dennis, Storm Ciara and now Storm Jorge.For three weeks in a row, rain and floods have brought abject misery across the country from the north of England to Wales – the same areas that gave Boris Johnson his -seat majority.Homes have been ruined.

Like millions of other couples, they have lived together for a while, and now they are having a baby and getting married.Even the way they got that dog, Dilyn the Jack Russell rescue puppy, is reminiscent of other ­couples who get a pet because they have not yet got a baby.Boris is by nature an optimist. He presses ahead where more cautious career politicians would hang back, worried the whole thing would upset too many voters, especially those of an old-fashioned disposition.But Boris has horried them already, by becoming the first Prime Minister ever to live with his girlfriend in Downing Street.Old-fashioned voters ought to be delighted that he is now getting married to Carrie.He has always loved having children, the more the better as far as he is concerned.And he loves being married. This may seem a curious thing to write of a man who will have twice been orced, once the formalities to end his present marriage have been completed.But Boris is not one of those men who regards commitment with terror. With boundless optimism, he dismisses the doubts that might have held him back.His first marriage, to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, whom he met at Oxford University, was not a success. She had appeared on the cover of Tatler, was famous for her beauty and was a sympathetic and sensitive person.But she could not bear being married to such a driven man, who worked with titanic energy to make a success of his chosen career of journalism.She and Boris were completely incompatible, and very soon the marriage broke down.His second marriage, to Marina Wheeler, was in many ways a great success, and lasted for a quarter of a century. They had four children, and were clearly very much in love.From time to time Marina threw him out of the house for having affairs, but she did not generally hurl him into outer darkness.He would instead find himself staying, during these periods of banishment, with mutual friends.But one cannot imagine Marina, a successful lawyer with socialist convictions, would ever have been happy living at No as the we of a Conservative Prime Minister.Carrie will embrace that role. She has worked for the Conservative Party, understands how it works and sympathises with its aims.Ministers for whom she has worked pay tribute to her acumen.Only two PMs before Boris have ever got orced: the Duke of Grafton in the eighteenth century, and Sir Anthony Eden, who succeeded Churchill in .As so often, Boris is breaking new ground, determined to do things his own way, unwilling to observe conventions for which he can see no point.In the theatre of politics, he puts on a performance unlike anyone ’s, and of which not everyone can approve, but which everyone finds themselves talking about. He got into the Commons in  but was soon criticised for ious gross failures of responsibility.When he was found to have lied to the Press about his affair with Petronella Wyatt — he dismissed the story as “an inverted pyramid of pfle”, when actually it was entirely true — he was sacked by the then Conservative leader Michael Howard from the front-bench team.This meant that in  Johnson was in no position to run for the leadership, and had to watch fellow Etonian David Cameron take over. A less resilient character would have abandoned politics for a well-paid career in newspapers and television. Johnson went off and became Mayor of London.He reached the top on his own terms, and now he is doing something wonderfully conventional he is getting married.

It’s costly, but seems to help.“Those that didn’t have enough on Lake Erie took on major ice.”Kucko said the igloo-style houses “may take until May to melt”.Ed Mis told WGRZ-TV that his home was encased in ice, that was between one and three feet thick.He said: I actually had to go out a secondary door and then chisel my way back into the house by breaking the ice.Fox News reported that residents were struggling with the dark interiors of their igloo-style homes, particularly as windows and doors were also covered.One homeowner, Lise Kreuder, told WIVB-TV that Hoover Beach needed a breakwater built to stop this from happening again in future.She said: My garage floor is starting to show cracks.

People think thatit has taken years then there must be something in it.“But it hasn’t taken years because of the work, it is because of the incompetency of the investigation by the IOPC.“The IOPC are so incompetent because there is no skill base.

Jeremy Corbyn’s “part-time Prime Minister” jibe has proved right, as Johnson could not be bothered to chair a Cobra session on the coronavirus until today.

Pete Buttigieg turned heads after claiming a shock victory in the Democratic Partyaposs Iowa caucus - and coming a close second in New Hampshire. But he will now leave democratic socialist Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden to duke it out with other rivals for the Democratic nomination.It comes barely  hours before the Democratic Partyaposs biggest day of nominations for its candidacy, known as Super Tuesday. Whoever wins the final nomination will take on Donald Trump for the White House in November.Buttigieg, the former two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is an Afghanistan war veteran and was the first openly gay candidate to make a run for the White House. But his early momentum from those rural, mostly white states did not translate into electoral success in the more erse states of Nevada and South Carolina. After finishing a distant third in the Nevada caucuses, Buttigieg came in fourth on Saturday in South Carolina, where he won support from just % of African-American voters. The centrist Democrataposs withdrawal from the race could help former Vice President Joe Biden, a fellow moderate who got a much-needed victory on Saturday. Biden is now looking to wrest momentum from liberal front-runner Bernie Sanders in this weekaposs -state Super Tuesday nominating contests. Speaking in South Bend, Buttigieg said his campaign began its unlikely journey with a staff of four, no big email lists and no personal fortune.  We got into this race in order to defeat the current president and in order to usher in a new kind of politics, Buttigieg told a crowd of supporters.

A dossier compiled by Hope Not Hate detailed incidents including a councillor in Hampshire who warned of a dangerous Muslim agenda for world domination in the name of Allah. A fellow councillor in Nottinghamshire said that mosques were culpable for terrorist attacks. A Tory spokeswoman today confirmed all those found to be party members have been suspended - but once again refused to say how exactly many there were. The file compiled by the anti-racism charity contains fresh allegations on top of a number which have already been reported. Hope Not Hate claimed they identied more than  Tory officials and activists, including six sitting councillors. The Conservatives have faced criticism from a number of senior figures in the party about their handling of Islamophobia -including former party chair Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. The Party insist that they move quickly to deal with Islamophobia but they have so far resisted calls for an independent inquiry.Last year during the party leadership campaign Boris Johnson promised to carry out an independent investigation into Islamophobia after a pledge by his fellow candidate Sajid Javid , but this has since been scaled back into a review of all forms of discrimination.Hope Not Hate, who released the details as part of their annual report into racism in the UK, said it had conducted polling of Conservative members that showed worryingly high levels of Islamophobic sentiment and  perceptions about Muslims among Tory grassroots members. More than two thirdsbelieved that there are areas of the UK that operate under Sharia law, while  per cent said that Islam is generally a threat to Western civilisation. Matthew McGregor, the campaign director of Hope Not Hate, told the Times the Tories had a problem with anti-Muslim prejudice in its party. They are not acting as swtly, or as forcefully, as they need to, and their approach lacks the transparency required to give people trust that they are taking the issue seriously enough, he said.

The film uses footage from the trailer for the new sequel to the film, which stars Tom Cruise and is due out in July. It claims it took them three-and-a-half years to pass a crucial tri-service flying course that should take  months.

A squadron leader wrote to the pilots: “All those who are named verbally or in text in the video are to report to RAF Shawbury Police.” The pilots are understood to be students at the tri-service Defence Helicopter School at RAF Shawbury, in Shropshire.

Daniel Warren, from Derby, who has autism and learning dficulties, suffered a flurry of punches to the head and arms.After the beating, he took refuge in one of his favourite cafes and broke down in tears, Derbyshire Live reports.The -year-old is now scared of leaving the house and is haunted by his attackersapos faces whenever he closes his eyes. When he was brutally attacked, Daniel said he was just minding his own business and doing what he loves - feeding the pigeons. The Spondon man said: The day started off brilliantly, I went to ArtCore because I love doing art, then I had a wander around town. I was going towards Derby Bus Station and I wanted to feed the pigeons, I’ve always loved the pigeons. It was nice and quiet around there, I like a bit of me time. It was around pm. That’s when they started swooping in on me, they punched me on my arms and smacked me in the head, you can still feel the lump. As they beat him up, Daniel said the attackers were taunting him and threw liquid which looked funny on his head. He said he struggled hard against the attackers and eventually managed to escape into Derby Bus Station. It was there that he saw one of his oldest friends and together they went to the Eagle Centre to get help. He said: She took me to the Eagle Centre to wash myself. We then went to Boots and told them what happened. They could see I was upset, then I went to Grand Café Caruso and I broke down in tears, I was trying not to. Daniel is a much-loved regular at the café and the staff treated him to a massive chocolate muffin to cheer him up.  After a short while, Danielaposs mum arrived on her way home from work and she informed the police at about pm. Daniel said: When I went to bed that night, I closed my eyes and all I could see was them, in my face. Some people are not very nice, I woke up the next day and I was shaking to get out the door. I was nervous. The following day was pancake day at college which Daniel said he had been looking forward to for weeks. He said: I was scared to come out my house but I thought it’s pancake day and I love pancake day. I thought no I’m going to go to college, everyone at college said I wasnapost my usual bouncy self. I told them what happened and gradually throughout the day I was getting better, coming out with pancake jokes. Instead of letting the incident push him over the edge, Daniel has decided to use his experience to help others. In the hours after the incident, Daniel made a YouTube video to raise awareness of autism and bullying.Posted on Monday, the video has achieved more than , views and has been shared  times on Facebook .Daniel said: Iaposve been attacked before, itaposs just because Iaposm dferent because of my autism. Thataposs why I put the YouTube video on, to make people aware about people with learning dficulties. Some people hide and bottle it up but I want to get a  going. I want to stand up for myself, I wonapost put up with it anymore. Daniel is a huge Derby County fan and goes to most home and away games. Since sharing the video, he said fellow Rams fans have sent him messages of support. He said: Even some Forest fans have messaged me. I never thought Iaposd see the day! My Derby County mates are absolutely horried, they are upset to say the least and Iaposm being polite. Daniel said he isnapost going to let the attack stop him from doing the things he enjoys. He said: It was horrible, I don’t want to go through that again. Itaposs  and still people are bullying people with learning dficulties.I’d like to do self-defence one day. I need Tyson Fury in my le. They wouldn’t mess with me then!"},{"url":null,"title":"baby covered scabs rashes after","story":"NewsBaby covered in scabs and rashes after getting hand foot and mouth from dirty pool’The babys dad said he wished he knew about the outbreak in a heartbreaking TripAdvisor post and claimed he saw \"at least six other families who were dealing with the same exact thing\" at the Royalton Riviera Cancun Resort  Spa in MexicoShareCommentsByEmma ParkerKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAR NewsThe toddler was left with scabs all over his legs \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

And in severe cases, bad conditions on puppy farms can lead to illnesses and complication costing up to £, to treat – and even mean the pooch being put down. The findings from a poll of vets have today been released by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to coincide with a campaign to help pet-lovers carry out checks before buying a puppy or kitten. The move comes in the run-up to the introduction next month of Lucy’s Law, which will ban the sale of puppies and kittens by third party dealers including pet shops and online traders. The ban marks a huge victory in The Mirror’s campaign to end so-called puppy farming by commercial breeders with abysmal welfare standards. “I am delighted that a ban on third party sales of puppies and kittens is coming into force – it is a crucial piece of legislation that will help us tackle the abhorrent and heart-breaking trade of pets,” said animal welfare minister Lord Goldsmith. “Our campaign will help raise awareness of the dangers associated with buying pets online and deceitful sellers. “The animals reared on puppy farms are often in awful conditions which can lead to chronic health problems, behavioural issues, and, in the most tragic cases, death.  “This simply has to stop and the public can do its bit to help. “We urge anyone thinking about getting a pet to do the right thing. “Do thorough research and ensure you go to a reputable breeder in the UK.”Lucy’s Law will mean that breeders will have to sell directly to the public rather than hiding behind third party sellers. Tips for spotting the dodgy breeders include:Beware of anyone selling multiple litters Check a seller’s contact details to seethey are being used on multiple website and adverts. Check the animal’s age – puppies and kittens must not be sold under eight weeks old."},{"url":null,"title":"dear coleen cant believe mum","story":"NewsopinionDear Coleen: I cant believe mum left all her cash to a friend who cared for herOur resident agony aunt Coleen Nolan helps this struggling single woman who is hurt and confused after her mum left her no money in her will but instead gave it all to her friendShareCommentsByColeen Nolan:,  MAR NewsopinionIt has left me feeling so terribly hurt and confused\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Of course I would have expected my mum to leave this friend something because she was so good to her, but not everything. I’m a single woman and work hard to pay the bills, and my mum must have known that money would have helped me. Also, it’s not just about the financial stuff – it’s the fact that she thought more of this woman than she thought of me. Well, that’s what it feels like. She did leave me a few bits of ­jewellery that have sentimental value – her wedding and engagement rings and a few other pieces, as well as our family photographs – but nothing of any real financial worth. Am I a bad person to feel this way when my mum’s died  It’s consuming my thoughts every day and I’m ­struggling to believe she actually did it. I don’t want it to all be about money, but I feel hurt and confused. Coleen says I don’t think you’re bad to feel this way and I understand you being shocked and disappointed, but I don’t think it’s going to help to dwell on it. It was her money to do with as she pleased – she could have left it to charity but she chose this friend. Perhaps she felt she wanted to give something back to this woman who had spent a lot of time caring for her. I don’t think it means she didn’t love you and it certainly doesn’t mean she valued this friend above you. In fact, she left you the things that really meant something to her – her wedding and engagement rings and other jewellery that was precious, and the family photographs.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe spotlight has landed on middle-aged men who taunted and threatened a teenage climate activist when she visited Bristol. There was a great deal of excitement in the week after Greta Thunberg announced she would visit the west England city and join a climate protest.Tens of thousands of people joined her on a march and watched her speak, in a high profile appearance covered by the Mirroraposs sister publication Bristol Post in great depth.Following in the wake of the outletaposs coverage were thousands of comments, many positive, but also many negative. They questioned the validity of climate science, suggested school children should not be able to go on strike, complained about disruption in the city and noted that young people have carbon footprints. There was also a lot of people that focused on Thunberg herself, a -year-old Swedish teenager who travels the world calling for action to tackle climate change. Amongst swathes of abuse were comments calling for and inciting violence against her and other young climate activists. Some had even called for people on social media to ‘be kind’ following the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack. The Bristol Post decided to give some of those responsible a  on its website. Kev Bennett Kev suggested that someone should grab Thunberg by her hair and swing her around. Can someone grab her pigtails and ms trunchable her over the fence, he wrote, referencing the infamous Roald Dahl character.When questioned by other Facebook users on the thread, Kev said she was aposnot a young childapos and aposalso a product of Anta parentsapos.Stevie Ralph-Taylor  Stevieaposs contribution to the debate was simple. On a post outlining the route of the march, he said: She should be burnt at the stake! Max Poncho Morgan  On a post discussing the School Strike for Climate, which Thunberg was a trailblazer of, Max said: milkshakes at the ready. The comment appears to be a reference to the  street trend of throwing milkshakes at public figures, including Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage. Max recently changed his Facebook profile to include a aposBe Kindapos filter - a phrase of advice much-used following the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack. Kevin Bird    On a Bristol City Council post warning about the possibilities of crowd crushes, Kevin offered his two cents. Crush the b***h. Sounds good to me. Send her home, he wrote. Ash Ashfaq In a thread on Facebook in which the changes to the bus routes and road closures was discussed, Ash Ashfaq called for Greta Thunbergaposs parents to physically assault her.

Venables and Robert Thompson, both aged  at the time of the murder in , have never seen the inside of an adult jail for the two-year-oldaposs murder. One of them has been housed just  minutes away from Jamesapos devastated parents, Denise and Stuart Fergus, who are desperate for the pair to get aposproperapos sentences in prison. They hope that Jamesapos landmark birthday on March  will be one with a positive legacy as they continue their campaign, but are adamant celebration is the wrong word. Speaking on new podcast series, aposHelen Wood chats to...apos - a collaboration with the Manchester Evening News - Denise said: “There’s been no justice for James whatsoever.“Thereaposs only one thing that I asked for and that was for them to have a proper sentence in a prison. “I didnapost expect them to throw away the key - I knew one day they’d walk again, but at least I would have had some justice for Jamesthey’d have spent time in an adult prison.  “But they never have done, they were put in a children’s secure unit where they got the best of everything so thereaposs no justice there again. “In fact I feel that they’ve been rewarded for the crime that they have committed - not punished.” When James was abducted, tortured and killed in February  in Bootle, Merseyside, it sent shock waves across the nation which have never been forgotten. Venables and Thompson served eight years in children’s secure units - the former was sent to the Red Bank Home in Merseyside while the latter was housed in Barton Moss Secure Care Centre in Manchester.  After being freed in , they were given new identities at the age of . Years later, when Denise and her husband Stuart found out they had been housed in close proximity to their home in Liverpool - one just  minutes away - they were devastated. Denise said: “They may as well have put one each side of me, at least then I would have known where they were and I would have kept a closer eye on them.” The couple told Big Brother winner Ms Wood how over the years they would be approached on the street by complete strangers who claimed to have knowledge about Jamesapos killers lestyles at the childrenaposs units.Stuart said: “We could be out shopping one day and someone would come and speak to us and then walk away. “We’ve had people knock at the door, total strangers who say she [Denise] was not getting the correct justice.” While Thompson has kept a low profile, Venables - whose identity has been leaked online - was sent to prison in  and  over possession of child abuse imagery. This prompted Denise to  petition the government  to conduct a public inquiry into her sonaposs case, which she believes raised a aposnumber of issues that have been swept under the carpetapos.In the petition, which received more than , signatures, Denise questioned why experts deemed Venables to be rehabilitated, and called for the report of the prison service into an aposincidentapos at Red Bank secure unit to be published. The government responded: The offender was convicted of further offences as a direct result of robust and effective monitoring. Therefore the Government considers that a public inquiry into this tragic case is not necessary. The frustrated mum - who also has thee other sons, Thomas, Leon and Michael - believes that Venables should be held to account for his identity being leaked online, believing itaposs aposhis faultapos.  She continued: “He’s untouchable, that’s the way it feels. All the money that’s spent on him to hide his identity, hundreds of thousands have been spent on him.” Stuart agreed, adding: “He’s laughed in the face of the government. Despite the horror of that day, Denise has always remained calm and composed and has dedicated her le to getting justice for her son. But for her family, itaposs a fight that is yet to be won. Speaking to Big Brother winner Helen Wood on the podcast, which is a collaboration with the Manchester Evening News, Denise said: “There’s been no justice for James whatsoever.  “Thereaposs only one thing that I asked for and that was for them to have a proper sentence in a prison. “I didnapost expect them to throw away the key - I knew one day they’d walk again, but at least I would have had some justice for Jamesthey’d have spent time in an adult prison. “But they never have done, they were put in a children’s secure unit where they got the best of everything so thereaposs no justice there again. “In fact I feel that they’ve been rewarded for the crime that they have committed - not punished.” Since his death, Denise and her family have worked tirelessly to help other families in James’ name through the work of the James Bulger Memorial Trust. The charity supports young people who are disadvantaged through bereavement,crime, hatred or bullying, by providing family holidays. They have events throughout the year to fund raise for the charity, and the next one will be their biggest yet. This year’s Black Tie and Tiara Ball, Saturday, March , will celebrate a milestone that James sadly never reached.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum of nine does three loads of washing a day and runs bathtimes like a conveyor belt. Manchester mum Claire Ambrose was just  when she had her first baby Jake, but he was tragically stillborn at six months into her pregnancy.At  she welcomed her twin girls Jessica and Leah, who are now that age themselves - Jessica being the first to move out of the familyaposs home in Failsworth to live with her boyfriend, Manchester Evening News reported .After separating from their dad shortly after they were born, Claire raised the twins alone until meeting partner Chris Boyle, with whom sheaposs had seven more children - four boys and three girls. Thereaposs Alex,  Alicia,  Kayleigh,  Lewis, nine Marissa, eight Leo, six and the youngest, four-year-old Tommy. Itaposs the love of that aposbaby phaseapos that has kept Claire, now, , yearning for more. If it wasnapost for a breast cancer diagnosis in December - and the treatment sheaposs now having - she admits she would probably have had more children. Despite the anxiety that followed her stillbirth and the premature arrival of her twins, who came five weeks early, her pregnancies were straightforward, with just the usual morning sickness. We didnapost plan on having so many, said Claire. But we didnapost stop it either. We were quite laid back really and the children always asked me to have another one too. I loved getting a bump and feeling movements. It was probably a bit of enjoying pregnancy and that baby, baby stage. I think as soon as the youngest starts to walk and talk and is able to answer back, thataposs when I want another baby - one who canapost answer back she laughed. I would like another girl, because my youngest girl is now eight, but I canapost because of the health problems. When it comes to managing such a big household, Claire - whose shortest labour was with Alicia, who was born at home just  minutes after she started with contractions - says itaposs all about being organised.  The family live in a neat three-storey, four-bed town house. By the time the kids get home from school each day, sheaposs got tomorrowaposs unorm hung on the back of the living room door ready to go. Three loads of washing are usually done each day - the children bring their dirty washing downstairs and separate it into darks, lights and colours. Theyaposre quite good at helping out really, Claire said. The older boys might just chuck it down but generally they all do their bit. If the washer breaks, which can happen a lot, I just want to cry. We do have to work as a team or  it just doesnapost work. Sunday is the day when we pull everything out and do a big clean and itaposs the day we get the homework done too.  Creative homework is the worst, it does get a bit messy and Iaposve had to ask another mum for help carrying things to school before nowitaposs been a big project theyaposve had to make. Claire said that bath time is aposlike a conveyor beltapos with the kids taking it in turns to jump in either the bath or the shower. Iaposll run the bath for one and then when one is in the bath another will get in the shower and itaposll just carry on like that until theyaposre all done, said Claire. She helps things run smoothly by making sure each of the children has a full set of unorm to last the whole week. The younger ones will have five polo shirts, jumpers and trousers washed and ironed ready for a Monday. It comes at a cost though.  With £ each for a pair on school shoes, the footwear bill for the seven school aged children amounts to £ alone, and thatapossone pair lasts the year. Claire is savvy with money though and saves wherever she can - making the most of sales, offers and cashback sites. Now unable to work since her cancer diagnosis, Claire has done part-time jobs around the children whenever she could - most recently at McBrides Cleaning last year - and Chris works full time manufacturing frames at Shepley Windows in Dukinfield. The child benefit cap, which means families can now only claim it for up two children, wasnapost brought in until after her children were born so Claire gets £ a week for the youngest seven. On top of that she gets £ a week in child tax credit. But with bills including the £ a month rent, nearly £ a month for gas and electric and £ for council tax, as well as the weekly £ food shop, thereaposs little spare for luxuries.  She canapost do the shopping in one lot either, because thereaposs nowhere to store it all. Theyaposll easily go though  pints of milk a week, six boxes of cereal and endless toilet rolls. Iaposll buy a pack of  toilet rolls about every three days and put four in each bathroom, said Claire, but almost daily youaposll get someone shouting from the toilet that they need one. Weaposve had to run out to the corner shop while theyaposre still on the toilet before now. The children donapost go without. They have smart clothes, consoles and tablets like most kids, but Claire says such big items are always for their birthday or Christmas. The four boys share one bedroom, the three youngest girls in another and twin Leah now has her own room. Theyaposve never taken them abroad and any family holiday is usually spent in a caravan at a Haven site. With so many children, it wouldnapost be worth risking a fine for a cheaper holiday in term time.  Claire is all too aware of the judgements people make about big families, and is keen to change that stigma. There are people I know who don’t work because they don’t want to, theyaposre too lazy or whatever, said Claire. I could afford the kids when I had them. We had Chris bringing a wage in too, but even now I still want to be able to give my kids as much as I can. And I have tried to teach the kids thatyou want money you have to earn it. There is slot of stigma that people have children for the benefits - andthey are capable of working and choose not to then fair enough. Don’t get me wrong, I love being home with my kids, but I know thatI’m ever going to be able to take them abroad on holiday, or give them nice things, I’m going to have to work for it. I’m not scared of doing that. She added: With regards to the benefit cap in respect of more than two kids, then yes in some ways why have them allyou can’t pay for them and you’re not willing to go and get a job. But it’s a bit unfair to bring the rule in and cap all big familiesthere are circumstances that get in the way of them working.  Claire hasnapost had much external support apart from that of her own mum, who was able to help more when she was younger, before she had health problems of her own. Her dad died when she was  and her only sibling, brother Anthony, lives in America. The comments do hurt sometimes, she said. You do get comments where they say that I bet the kids are scruffy or the house is disgusting or that I smoke, drink, or take drugs, but to be honest I clean my house daily. I don’t smoke, I certainly don’t go drugs and I had my first glass of wine since Christmas last weekend as a mini celebration for being able to lie on my side again after my op - and that was won on a raffle. I rarely go out. I don’t have the money to waste. I’d rather it went on my kids. Things in my house like new carpets I get off pay weekly companies. I don’t have the money to pay for expenses like that in full. But I want my kids to have a nice home. I don’t spoil them, they don’t get new clothes every weekend, or lots of treats, or money for nothing. On their birthdays they get to pick what they want for tea, like McDonaldaposs or KFC and again I use money off vouchers. I do my best. They might not be as lucky as some kids and get as much as some kids, but they never complain. I always try and make them appreciate what they have got and tell them there are children out there who have a lot less. They also are lucky enough to have brothers and sisters who will always be there for them to talk to and keep each other company.  If they ask why they can’t go on a plane, I reply something silly like, aposthere isn’t an aeroplane big enough for us allapos, or aposmummy doesn’t have enough pennies yet, but one dayapos. I also try and take them on free days out to places like Heaton Park or Blackpool. It doesn’t have to cost an arm and leg, money doesn’t have to be wasted on arcades, mine will be happy playing on the beach for hours and having an ice cream. Claire and Chris recently decided to separate, but she says they remain good friends and he will be there for the children as much as he can. For now she needs to concentrate on her breast cancer treatment and recovery to hopefully give her many more years to enjoy her big brood.

Mum Meghan Markle is expected to leave nine-month-old Archie in Canada when she s to the UK this week for her and husband Prince Harryaposs last days as working royals.It is thought that Archie will stay with a nanny and family friend Jessica Mulroney while Meghan, , and Harry, , are here. Harry ed to the UK last week, and he and Meghan are due to appear together at three events early this month before they officially quit public le on March .  The Queen, , and the Royal Family are understood to be very sad that they have seen so little of Archie since he was born in May last year, the Sunday Times reported.Archie hasnapost been the UK this year and for the past three months has been in Canada, where the Sussexes have been staying in a waterfront mansion on Vancouver Island. The Queen and Prince Philip, , met their great-grandson at Windsor Castle when he was two days old, but missed his christening two months later because they were attending an annual private weekend they host at Sandringham.  Archie is said to have met his cousins Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis at a polo match in July, but contact since then has been minimal, it was reported. Harry and Meghan have kept Archie out of the public eye.The last official sighting was a photo - showing Harry holding his son - that was posted on the coupleaposs Instagram account.Meanwhile, detectives protecting Harry and Meghan have been staying in a luxury taxpayer-funded £,-a-week Airbnb in Canada.The Duke and Duchessaposs security team were housed close to the coupleaposs eight-bedroom oceanfront mansion on Vancouver Island, having access to a beach and sea views. Only when Harry flew back to the UK last week for his remaining public appearances before stepping back fully from royal le later this month, did the protection officers move out.  A neighbour said: There used to be a security team there. They moved out a few days ago when Harry went. We havenapost seen them since. Other officers are understood to be accommodated where on the island and had been staying in a waterfront hotel since the couple arrived in Canada in November. It is understood the move will stretch resources on the Met Police, who are in charge of protecting the couple, further. While the Duke and Duchess are protected in the UK, it will mean their son will also require security as he remains in Canada.

Dave Pyne, who has worked as an HGV driver for a waste management firm for the last  years in north Wales, said he was emptying a cardboard recycling bin in Wrexham when he found two young children asleep inside it. The -year-old recounted the concerning incident as he revealed he had seen a rise in the number of people sleeping inside bins or using them as shelter.The most worrying incident was in Wrexham two years ago. I was emptying a cardboard recycling bin, and something just didnapost feel right, Mr Pyne told North Wales Live. My sixth sense said to check it, so I opened the lid, and as I started to move pieces around, I couldnapost believe what I saw. Inside were two young kids sleeping, a boy and a girl. They must have only been nine or . I woke them up, and they were so scared, they jumped out and ran off. I reported it to social services, but I never heard anything back. Mr Pyne spoke to North Wales Live after a report from the Waste Management Company Bfa revealed a shocking surge in rough sleepers using bins as shelter. At least seven people are known to have been killed in the last five years because they were sleeping in bins, according to a Health and Safety executive. From April to December , Bfa employees recorded  near misses or encounters with people either sleeping in or near its bins.

He appeared at the window of the Vaticanaposs Apostolic Palace for the first time since Wednesday for his weekly Sunday noon message and blessing. He said: Unfortunately a cold will force me not take part this year . I will follow the meditations from here.

The pontf attended the Ash Wednesday mass earlier this week and he appeared to be suffering from a cold. He was seen blowing his nose and coughing during the service and his voice sounded hoarse.The Vatican had previously said only that he was suffering from a slight indisposition. His spokesman Matteo Bruni dismissed speculation that Francis was anything more than slightly unwell. There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition, he said.

Obviously, we look at it by position to try to make them better technically and tactically but we want all players comfortable in taking the ball.“We’re not fixated on systems and formations right across the club, we want to do what’s right for our inidual players.“It’s also about getting us to empower the coaches to be able to deliver those same messages across the board. We’re constantly reviewing and adapting our model. We don’t want to just stand still. We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club. The calibre of people you are working with on a daily basis is great. We’ve got some of the best people around.“If you look at the profile of the type of player this club tends to produce, there’s a creative flair but we want to help by giving them as much information as possible.”Payne added: “Logan Chalmers and Keiran Freeman are next in line.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50894230-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50894230-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50894230-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50894230-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"picture story 150 wrds hre","story":"A -year-old Dundonian has shocked both friends and family after completing the Miami Marathon and raising almost £ for charity.Gary Calder first donned his running shoes after two members of his family were diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy.He began training every lunch time and in just two years he went from only being able to run k to completing the Miami marathon in  hours  minutes.While he has since tested negative for the condition, Gary has used his love of running to raise a whopping £. for Muscular Dystrophy UK.He said: “I just want to give something to the charity which is fund raising for the research towards finding a cure.“My attitude is to just crack on # I see the job of training as a due diligence.

It was sport, it was boxing, it was football – and every pub on that landscape was steeped in stories of legends and heroes of renown.“And on such a Saturday at noon in , I, an apprentice, along with four journeymen, left our job site at Dundee University and headed along Park Place toward Hawkhill.“It was agreed we would stop and have one pint – no more, then be off on our separate ways.“My elusive memory can’t decide which pub we entered, it was either Mickey Coyle’s or The Globe.“Whatever establishment it was, business was ramping up to a steady Saturday afternoon crowd.”Betting was illegal in those days, but there were ways around that, as Rob continued: “Standing at the bar sipping on a pint was a bookie’s runner making his rounds of the local pubs.“From punters, he accepted money and slips of paper signed with a nom-de-plume and scribed with a meticulous studied selection of racing form – along with hopes and dreams of a Saturday night windfall.“As pints were poured, the discussion continued.“The euphoria from Dundee’s very own Dick McTaggart’s recent magnicent and glorious Olympic achievement had mellowed and everyone had evolved from a fan to a McTaggart advisor – should Dick turn professional or stay amateur and become an ambassador for his sport “As a young lad I was undergoing my indoctrination into the protocol of behaviour in the company of elders in a licensed establishment.“And I watched and listened to the debate of the journeymen as they detailed the pros and cons of stepping up from amateur to professional in the sweet science of boxing.“The advice was well thought out and worthy of consideration. But it was Dick who made his own decision – a decision he doesn’t regret.”The discussion then suddenly veered into who was the best football player to ever play in Dundee Junior leagues.Rob went on: “The journeymen were veterans of WW, when young men of their generation had lived and breathed football in that glorious sports decade of the ’s when Dundee was saturated with talent and the city was a giant encompassing sports stadium.“They were men from another time.“A name came forth – Tiddler Forbes.“According to two of the journeymen, he was the greatest dribbler of a ball – bar none.“They were emphatic that Tiddler could do things with a ball that no other mortal could.“Some years ago, I am positive I read in BwB a reference to Tiddler Forbes.“However, I can’t recall the content of the article.“What stays with me is not just the name, what stays with me is the utmost conviction of the journeymen who declared Tiddler Forbes the greatest junior football player of their generation.”I also can’t recall the reference, so, is there a BwB reader with any information on Tiddler Forbes "},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"oz-glasgow-memories-judy","story":"THE story of Judy Garlandrsquos le continues to fascinate film-makers ndash the latest movie about the Hollywood star who shot to fame after playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, is currently lighting up cinemas and winning awards around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"70k-raised-place-mandela-statue-glasgow","story":"FUNDRAISING for a statue of Nelson Mandela in Glasgow has been stepped up on the th anniversary of his release from prison."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-glasgows-queen-barras-five-facts-maggie-mciver","story":" Maggie McIver, Queen of the Barras, had her first taste of business when she looked after a family friendrsquos fruit barrow in Parkhead.

It was a tight call but the striker was onside.The victory however was tempered by an injury to centre-back Scott McKenna who was replaced early in the second half.Scotland international McKenna pulled up when racing against Jon Obika to win a through ball.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"gallery-grand-opening-dream-come-true-owner-artist","story":"AN Innerleithen gallery is set to officially launch in the town next month, supporting the career dreams of

Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held against the backdrop of a cut to our capital budget this year of  percent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield

Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do this for up to  days to help reduce the possible spread of infection.What are the symptoms of coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, with the Centers for Disease Control and

illness.The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-self-isolation---can-affect-rights-pay-work","story":"UPuntil a week ago many of us had probably never heard the term lsquoself-isolationrsquo.But now not a day goes by without us being aware of people who have been asked or chosen to isolate themselves in order to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid statutory sick pay while Irsquom away from work Onlyyou are medically unfit for work and meet the eligibility criteria for Statutory Sick Pay.Will my pay be affectedI have to stay at home due to my

school.You must noty your employer as soon as possible and advise, where practicable, how long the disruption is likely to last.This time off is unpaid but you may request to use this time as paid annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo.

Deer numbers on the estate, part of Caenlochan Glen, increased by % between  and  from , to ,.The Scottish Government says deer population control in Scotland is a major issue, because the animals destroy forests that are needed in the fight against climate change, as are peatlandrsquos, which the deer can disturb.They are also estimated to cause , road accidents every year in Scotland. Earlier this year, a report ordered by the Scottish Government recommended thousands more deer be culled annually across the country to address the issue.Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland, the countryrsquos association representing hillwalkers, said: ldquoWe have major problems in Scotland with too many deer and the effect itrsquos having on the natural habitat.ldquoI think Caenlochan is the worst area for deer in Scotland and Balmoral is part of the problem.ldquoItrsquos time the Royal Family,they are serious about climate change, start reducing numbers of deer.Robbie Kernahan, director at Scottish Natural Heritage said: ldquoThe estates in the South Grampian and Caenlochan area, including Balmoral, have been working with SNH to reduce deer numbers.A SNH spokesman added: ldquoOur recent Deer Progress Report showed that while challenges remain, signicant progress has been made by landowners and managers.ldquoSNH leads a programme of work to promote sustainable deer management across Scotland, recognising the essential role it needs to play to help address climate change and bioersity loss.ldquoResearch shows deer numbers increased in Scotland from  to , but numbers have since stabilised because of increased culling, which is sometimes necessary to ensure healthy deer populations, reduce road traffic accidents and prevent signicant damage to our agriculture, forestry and nature.A Balmoral source said: ldquoRed deer are an iconic addition to Balmoral but there can be a clear conflict between deer culling and ensuring local forests are maintained around the estate.ldquoThe estate is doing itrsquos very best to ensure a balance is maintained and is working with relevant authorities to ensure this is achieved.A recent report has said up to one million wild deer, nearly double previous estimates, could be roaming the country, damaging the landscape and hampering environmental efforts.The findings, published by the Deer Working Group, is urging Scottish ministers to crack down on uncooperative Highland estates that refuse to control deer numbers to protect their lucrative hunting market, by using legal powers to enforce culls.But landowners have criticised the recommendations, saying the report comes in sharp contrast to similar research by Scottish Natural Heritage published just two months earlier.The body that represents rural businesses and landowners, Scottish Land and Estates , also insisted conflicting evidence on the future of deer management in Scotland should not overshadow the recent progress achieved.It maintained the issue was not about overall deer numbers but about their impact on local areas.Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of the SLE, said: ldquoSubstantial progress has been made in the operation of deer management groups over the past five years, with the sector demonstrating its ability to respond and adapt to new challenges and manage deer in a way that is sustainable and safeguards public interests.\"Some deer estates in areas such as Glen Artney and Strathtay, Perthshire, have red deer densities above  per square kilometre, while numerous parts of Inverness-shire, the Cairngorms, Deeside and Angus have between  and  per square kilometre.

She has ed this with interest amidst disguised references to Robertsonrsquos carelessness in losing his Moray seat to a Tory in .A state of civil stre quietly thrums beneath the surface of this most disciplined of political machines, and Cherry and Robertson are seen to be on either side of the fault-line. Allies of Cherry feel Robertsonrsquos fingerprints are all over some of the moves that have been made against her within the Westminster group over the last year or so.Cherry, currently the MP for Edinburgh South West, has become one of the most recognised parliamentarians at Westminster since she won her seat in , feared and admired in equal measure. She was instrumental in defeating Boris Johnsonrsquos plan to sabotage parliament late last year and is a formidable speaker from the floor of the House. This has caused jealousy among lesser-plumed party colleagues who have dutully toiled in the party for years without any recognition. ldquoShersquos just in the door five minutes, they say, ldquoand already shersquos coveting Nicolarsquos job.

Irsquom proud of her and of how well shersquos represented the cause of Scottish independence. I want to support her in leading Scotland to independence and in securing ourto the European Union. I certainly have my dferences with her, not least on her support for the proposed reforms of the Gender recognition Act, but more unites us than ides us.Ah yes, the Gender Recognition Act: never has something so scarcelyunderstoodby the vast majority of the general population caused so much turbulence within the gilded chambers of a political party. For those who inhabit the world outside cyberspace and the political bubble this is what it means. The Scottish Government wants to make it much easier for people to change their gender by enabling them to \"self-declare\"rather than endure a prolonged process. Cherry and other feminists within the SNP, most notably Joan McAlpine, convenor of Holyroodrsquos influential Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee, have urged caution.Both women have endured abuse and intimidation from within the party for expressing concerns for womenrsquos sex-based rightsthe proposed GRA reforms come to pass. Cherry is careful to say that the abuse has come from ldquothe tiniest of factions who wield ldquodisproportionate influence.ldquoAs an out gay woman who fought section  and has campaigned for LGBT rights for decades, accusations that I am transphobic are offensive. The online abuse does take its toll but I am more worried about the cumulative and detrimental effect on what it does for the role of women in politics and in the media young women in particular. I donrsquot like the way this is characterised as a problem in the youth wing of the party.:MP Joanna Cherry: Scotland will be ignored at WestminsterldquoMany admirable young people are involved in Scottish politics and I know a number of women and men in Young Scots for Independence and SNP Youth who have spoken to me privately about their concerns. The abuse is deeply misogynistic. The attacks on me and other women in the party are clearly a breach of our code of conduct and must be dealt with.ldquoIrsquom very proud of the fact that in Scotland we have very good rights-based protections for trans people. No one is seeking to change that. However, women have legitimate concerns about the proposed changes to the law on gender recognition.Within the SNPrsquos Westminster group you sense she is admired rather than loved and therersquos not a little resentment at her high profile. One of her party colleagues at Holyrood has been aghast at her treatment at Westminster: ldquoShersquos a really sharp intellect, as forensic in her approach to politics as she was to the law. She does have what Burns called a guid conceit o hersel. This is admired and expected in male leaders, but women are held to a dferent standard and expected to show humility. She needs to build alliances though that is the clubby bit of politics which can evade hard-working women and allow mediocre men to advance.Cherry challenges my suggestion that the party could do without this contest in Edinburgh Central. ldquoCompetition in politics is healthy, she says. ldquoDebating ideas is good for developing policy. This isnrsquot being disloyal to the leadership. Holyrood and Westminster proceed by debate this is how we get to the nub of things.The fabled independence Plan B, which the party rejected last year, has ed for inspection now that Boris Johnson simply wonrsquot discuss a second independence referendum. This is another area where Cherry is perceived to be at odds with her boss. She rejects this.ldquoI wouldnrsquot back a wildcat or illegal referendum. How could I, given my legal background  I endorse Nicolarsquos declaration that this should proceed legally. However we have reached an impasse: people keep voting for us and opinion polls show support for Yes is hovering around %, yet Johnson wonrsquot budge.ldquoMy experience of knocking on doors is that there are lots of soft Nos who are interested in the idea of Scotland staying in the EU through independence. But we have to look at the economy and currency the process of getting back into the EU and how longrsquos it going to take. We must also deal with the border with England and de-dramatise it. The idea that people wonrsquot be able to have a cup of tea in Berwick without showing their passport is ludicrous. Wersquore all in the common travel area.\"Cherry is keen to stress that seeking a ruling from the Supreme Court on Holyroodrsquos competence to hold a referendum without Londonrsquos agreement does not amount to support for a wildcat vote.\"If we pass a bill through Holyrood to hold a referendum this might be challenged by the UK governmentrsquos law officer and then arrive at the Supreme Court. Any organisation could challenge it. Under section  of the Scotland Act within four weeks of a Bill passing the Advocate General, the Attorney General or the Scotlandrsquos Lord Advocate could choose to refer the question of the Billrsquos competence to the Supreme Court.ldquoIt would be for them to decide by a process of statutory interpretation whether this Bill was within the powers of Holyrood. Irsquod hope they wouldnrsquot just look at the Act but note the two countriesrsquo markedly dferent routes of travel and all the recent democratic votes in several political jurisdictions. If they said the Bill was within Holyroodrsquos competence wersquod have our referendum. Andnot I donrsquot think wersquod lose anything.Cherry would probably have been a judge by nowshersquod continued her legal career, with the prospect of earning much more money. She had a stellar career specialising in prosecuting sexual offence cases. Why did she choose this uncertain and venomous arena where party rules canrsquot prevent a woman from experiencing abuse and venom simply for adhering to long-held principles ldquoIf Irsquod known it would be like this I wouldnrsquot have stood for election, she says, ldquoand itrsquos sad that women might be put off entering politics because of it.

Indeed, you could even have a debate about whether or not they can even have pleasurable experiences.ldquoItrsquos possible to argue that globally ndash although certainly not in Scotland ndash that farm animals experience too much pain and not enough pleasure.Researchers at the college have already established a signicant overlap between the views of Scottish farmers and scientists on the potential benefits of positive animal welfare.An earlier study showed farmers largely shared scientistsrsquo views on how playing and forming social bonds had positive outcomes for livestock. They also appeared to largely agree that stress and health issues had a negative impact on animals.However, the researchers ndash who interviewed livestock farmers from the dairy, beef, sheep, pig and poultry sectors across Scotland ndash also found farmers felt those positive welfare opportunities were only relevant once an animalrsquos needs were taken care of.Mr Lawrence added: ldquoMost people have certain views about how animals should be reared, and the idea that animals are sentient feeds into our moral debates.ldquoFarmers are under enormous pressure across the board and are arguably in a very unfair situation because itrsquos us that is demanding food from them.ldquoRather than focus on farmers we should all consider our own choices and behaviour.ldquoThe fact we have cheap food leads to waste and general devaluing of what this was in the first place - an animal.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10946943.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeons-indyref2-mandate-based-starkly-disproportionate-election-win","story":"The Electoral Reform Societysaid Scotland produced the ldquomost disproportionate result of any part of the UK because the SNPrsquos share of MPs so far outweighed its share of the vote.It said Ms Sturgeonrsquos party won  per cent of the  Scottish seats in December on % of the vote because of the in-built unfairness of the first-past-the-post voting system, which the SNP itself wants replaced.:Mark Smith: How to sell Scottish independence to people like meIt said the SNPrsquos performance ldquodelivered one of the most warped results in the UK, with a  percentage point increase in seats for an eight-point increase in votes.The ERS calculated that under proportional representation, the SNP would have won ,  or  seats, depending on which PR system was used, rather than the  it did.Two of those results would have given the SNP a minority of seats, leaving Ms Sturgeon unable to claim the SNP had emphatically won the election or that Scotland had backed Indyref.The ERS also applied a measure which assesses the extent to which an election result deviates from proportionality, the DV index.PR voting systems, because they are approximate, typically score  to .Across the UK, the general election result scored . on the DV index, showing it was less proportionate.But in Scotland, it was ., which the ERS called \"starkly disproportionate\".From  seats in , the SNP won  seats last year, plus one where the candidate was described as SNP on the ballot even though he had been suspended from the party.The latter was the result of the party taking action against Neil Hanvey in Kirkcaldy  Cowdenbeath over alleged anti-semitism after the ballot paper could be changed.He is now technically an Independent MP, but sits and votes with the SNP at Westminster and hopes toto the party fold.:Scottish independence support maintains lead in latest pollAfter the election, the SNP cited the % of seats won in its demand for Boris Johnson to give Holyrood the power to hold a legal independence referendum, with Ms Sturgeon saying the result ldquostrengthened her mandate.The Prime Minister refused, while Tory MSPs and MPs pointed out the SNP won less than half the vote, a complaint the SNP flatly dismissed.However, todayrsquos ERS report says the election left the vast majority of Scottish voters ldquovoiceless as their choices were not reflected under the winner-take-all voting system.It said that of .m votes cast north of the border, .m or .% were ldquoeffectively ignored as they did not contribute to the result because they either went to candidates who were not electedor were surplus votes for winning candidates.The report said: ldquoOver half of votershellip do not have an MP they voted for.ldquoIn Scotland, voters of both the Conservatives and Labour suffered, with % of Conservative voters and % of Labour voters going unrepresented, compared to just % of SNP voters.The UK is the only EU country still to use a first-past-the-post voting system.The ERS Society, which campaigns for a fairer voting system, said it was to the SNPrsquos credit that the partyrsquos policy is to switch to a PR method, but still described the result the SNP enjoyed last year as based on an ldquoinsult to the millions who want to be heard.Dr Jess Garland, Director of Policy and Research at the ERS, said: ldquoVoters in Scotland are being cheated out of fair representation in the Commons.ldquoThe huge scale of unrepresented votes, in Scotland and across the UK, represents a democratic crisis that has to be tackled.

Ms Stephenson is quite correct that ldquoGovernment funding is about priorities. Of course it is, but while Ms Stephenson may not agree with the Scottish Governmentrsquos priorities, they were chosen by the Scottish electorate.She is also critical of the performance of the Scottish Government on several health measures so perhaps she didnrsquot see Professor Danny Dorling on BBCrsquos  Days, commenting on, as the interviewer put it, the ldquoshocking degree of health inequalities in England, and in particular the decline in le expectancy among women, especially in deprived areas. One of his observations is that infant mortality in England has risen since , but in Scotland more was spent in this area, and infant mortality has declined.However, perhaps his most potent point is that the healthcare system in England is heading in the direction of ldquoone of the wealthier states in America, where medicine is privatised. However, in Scotland his view was that Scotlandrsquos NHS is influenced slightly more by the Scandinavian model of high-quality public services paid for by tax at a rate much higher than we would be used to in the UK.This illustrates well Ms Stephensonrsquos most profound dficulty, as any signicant policy drt ndash or ldquosplitting apart in the United Kingdom in terms of spending, policy, beliefs and outcomes as Professor Dorling put it ndash between Scotland and England is inconsistent with the concept of the Union. Such policy drt may well result in the Scottish electorate being faced with a choice of how best to realise their own priorities ndash as part of a United Kingdom which in terms of spending and policy and so on we have increasingly little in common, or independence where we are free to determine our own choices between our own priorities and to set spending to suit.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE \"day\" job that the SNP is constantly advised to concentrate on instead of yapping on about independence is of course to be getting on with the Westminster-directed Government in the same way that Toryism and Labour in Scotland take their orders direct from London. Letters and columns in The Herald that suggest that the SNPs campaigning while in government for independence alongside taking care of immediate responsibilities is incompatible practice, are choosing to dislodge the SNP from its foundations. That the SNP can do both the day job and pursue its countrys independence is well proven every day the Scottish Parliament exists. Certainly its day job is every bit as well carried out as is the Westminster day job and where are the Unionist complaints about Boris Johnson and Co spending too much of their time on Brexit and too little on immediate matters like education, housing, public services etc As for any letters moaning about there being no opposition to SNP rule in Holyrood, what worth of main opposition is there in Westminster apart from SNP MPs  A Labour that is near-enough indistinguishable from Tories doesnt qualy as opposition and for living proof of same just look at the numbers of both inhabiting the House of Lords. All singing from the same song sheet doesnt add up to anything but a one-party state.Ian Johnstone, Peterhead.WE all remember the ability of Teflon Tonyto emerge unscathed from repeated setbacks. This slippery characteristic was also true of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and, latterly, Donald Trump. It appears that Nicola Sturgeon also possesses the Teflon touch. Although floundering in a muddy sea of political impropriety and overseeing a dangerous slide in fiscal, health, education and policing standards, none of this mud appears to stick to her administration.The  General Election saw the SNP secure  per cent of the cast votes, yielding a disproportionate  per cent of seats. Ms Sturgeons misleading claim that she speaks for the people of Scotland clearly resonates with her devoted All Under One Banner supporters. The reality is that only one-third of the total electorate support her cause.Even as a teenager the First Minister \"had a strong feeling that it was wrong for Scotland to be governed by a Tory Government we never elected\". Perpetual repetition like this, known as \"effective frequency eventually lodges in peoples minds as truth. Many admire her undoubted tenacity and verbal agility, a quality she has honed to near perfection since she first took to the political stage. This nationalist mantra has become a blind obsession to the detriment of our country. Its time to cast off the blinkers of ancient nostalgia and focus on Scotlands real challenges.Ms Sturgeon recently said that Boris Johnson \"is the kind of guy who talks nonsense, has the swagger and confidence and conviction but despite the swagger its still nonsense\".

Itrsquos why the polls havenrsquot really moved. Wersquore trapped in mutual antagonism wersquore stuck in the trenches, lobbing insults over no manrsquos land wersquore knee-deep in mud.Fot all this warfare to end, the Scottish nationalist side needs to convince a signicant number of people to switch over to them, but I donrsquot think thatrsquos going to happen any time soon until their supporters change their strategy. Some of it is about changing the language, the words, and some of it is about better understanding the way in which many voters think. Properly done, it could be a way to convince people like me to support independence.:Joanna Cherry: I dont want to replace Nicola. I want to get to know herWhatrsquos got me thinking about all of this today is the interview the nationalist MP Joanna Cherry did with my colleague Kevin McKenna at the weekend because Ms Cherry was guilty of a lot of the kind of behaviour that winds voters up, and I would suggest needs to change. Talking about independence asitrsquos inevitable, for example, or dismissing concerns about the economy or borders with a wave of the hand. It makes many people think that politicians like Ms Cherry arenrsquot taking their worries seriously. It makes them dig down into their trenches a little bit deeper.So, herersquos a few ways that I think things that could be done dferently ndash a few ways in which the nationalists could adjust their strategy ndash and the first would be to talk more realistically about what independence actually means. Some nationalists delight in the thought of cutting the ties with England and some unionists are horried by the idea, but the reality is that after a Yes vote, the ties would still exist. Scotland would have constitutional independence, but not independence in any total sense: our ability to be autonomous would be limited just as it is for every other nation in the world, including the UK after Brexit.Talking to voters about independence in this more realistic way would be good for the nationalist cause because it would be less horrying for unionists or waverers. Indeed, the SNP has not always used the word ldquoindependence as prominently as it does now and for a long time preferred the phrase ldquoself-government. Naturally, talking about independence fires up the SNP base, but a better approach for general voters would be to talk about Scottish self-government within a new family of nations. Itrsquos a more mature and realistic idea that many voters could buy into.The second idea for a new approach for the SNP tackles the tricky subject of nationality and identity. The Scottish and British identities are not going to disappear from Scotland just because therersquos been a Yes vote and the SNP needs to acknowledge thatitrsquos to win over voters who feel British. Many SNP supporters and some of its leading figures have attempted to undermine the British identity or dismiss it or mock it and when they do so, therersquos a backlash, which isnrsquot surprising: people cling more tightly to their identity when they think itrsquos under threat. Wersquore back in the trenches again.Instead, the SNP needs to start talking about the ways it would respect and protect the British identity in Scotland after a Yes vote. Nicola Sturgeon did a little of this in her speech on the day Britain left the EU, but not nearly enough. She needs to explain to people that their British identity will be valued and protected even when there is constitutional independence, by guaranteeing a form of dual nationality for Scots born in the UK for example. Changing the constitutional status of a country does not change peoplersquos sense of cultural, social and personal identity.Which leads us to the subject of Scottish identity and how the SNP approach to that needs to change. First, the party needs to stop talking asthe values ascribed to a Scottish identity are in some way discrete or superior theyrsquore not. It also needs to dial down on the panic that it sometimes tries to spread that the Scottish identity is under threat from the UK or the Tories. The Scotsrsquo sense of identity was strong before the Act of Union, it was strong after, and itrsquos strong now. Also, no-one in government at Westminster has ever talked about the full assimilation of Scotland into the UK and playing up such threats strikes many voters as hysterical and silly. The SNP should do itself a favour and stop doing it.There are a few other ways in which the SNP could re-tune its strategy. For example, it should start talking about building a ldquosettled will in Scotland rather than promoting the idea that the constitution can, or should, be changed on .% of the vote . Scottish nationalistsshould also avoid adversarial and aggressive language and behaviour: less shouting, less pointing, less marching.:Scottish independence support maintains lead in latest pollFinally, the leading proponents of independence should avoid, at all costs, using any of the delusional and misleading techniques we saw in the Brexit debate. In her Herald interview, Joanna Cherry said any concerns that voters might have about the Scotland England border after independence were misplaced the idea, she said, that people wouldnrsquot be able to have a cup of tea in Berwick without showing their passport was ludicrous. But it was exactly that kind of rebuttal ndash dismissal with a pah ndash that the Brexiters tried when they were challenged about the border in Northern Ireland.Another example would be the cabinet minister Mike Russellrsquos recent comments on the economy. Mr Russell said Scotland pays out more than it gets back from the UK, a comment he might as well have plastered on the side of a bus, just like Boris Johnson did during the Brexit debate. It was an outrageous claim to make and outrageous claims only underline the need for a new, more realistic approach. Mr Russell has announced he is quitting Holyrood. Quite a few other nationalist MSPs have too. Maybe we will finally get it."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-eu-brexit-negotiations-get-underway-brussels","story":"David Frost, the Prime Ministerrsquos Europe adviser, and his team of negotiators will travel to Brussels to kick-start the nine-month process of vying to secure a new trade arrangement with the EU.Both sides published their negotiation mandates last week, revealing that they are at odds over Boris Johnsonrsquos push for a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal, as well as demands over fishing, state subsidies and standards.The EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal like Canadarsquos, which would eliminate most import taxes but still require some border checks, was not suitable for Britain due to its close proximity and links to the continent.Instead, he wants Britain to agree to sign up to a number of level-playing rules set by Brussels.The bloc is also arguing for little to change in terms of fishing quotas and access to British waters for European boats ndash a continuation of the status quo that ministers in Westminster are vehemently against.:French minister: We will not be blackmailed by UK over post-Brexit tradeA high-level meeting to take stock of progress is scheduled for June, by which time it should be clear whether the Canada-like agreement sought by Mr Johnson is possible by the end of the year.The EU wants to see progress on both fishing and financial services at that summer marker.Michael Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for Brexit preparations, said the UK would not ldquotrade away its ldquonewly recovered sovereignty during the talks.ldquoOur aim is to secure, through a fair and measured approach, a comprehensive free trade agreement, and also find common ground on questions such as fisheries, internal security and aviation, said the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in an article on Sunday.ldquoI believe we can secure a great new deal for an exciting new era.ldquoBut it is important that we are clear from the start that these negotiations are taking place in new times.ldquoYes, we want the best possible trading relationship with the EU.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.Storm Ciara:  of the most shocking photos of the damage flooding left in its wake Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"A Ballyclare man who slipped into a #dark place# during a bout of mental ill health is cycling across Northern Ireland#s football grounds to raise funds for Action Mental Health.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and disruption","story":"The road has been closed.

Mr Varadkar said questions surrounding Sinn Fein#s political funding are one the main reasons why he will not engage in government formation talks with Mary Lou McDonald. Writing in the Sunday Independent, he said: Sinn Fein public representatives claim to earn only the average industrial wage, yet their salaries are not ed to taxpayers or donated to the party. He added: Many appear to live way beyond their means, before calling for an investigation into their finances.Read MoreOpinionRuth Dudley Edwards: Accusing me of bigotry will not stop me voicing my belief Sinn Fein is fascist to its very coreMr Varadkar#s intervention comes as Sinn Fein continues to surge in the opinion polls. Ms McDonald#s party is up a massive  points to % with Fianna Failand Fine Gaelboth trailing behind them.The Sunday Times Behaviour and Attitudes opinion poll also has Ms McDonald as the country#s most popular political leader. Her personal satisfaction rating is up % to %, while Mr Varadkarand Micheal Martinhave both dropped points. Yesterday, Mr Varadkar insisted there are fundamental dferences between Fine Gael and Sinn Fein which would make them incompatible in government.He accused the party of failing to embrace constitutional democracy and refusing to recognise the Republic as a legitimate sovereign State.He said Sinn Fein operate dferently when it comes to political fundraising. The acting Taoiseach said the party holds lavish fundraising events in America and money is then routed through Northern Ireland.He said the party bought office space using front companies and said Sinn Fein MPs collected £.m from Westminster without taking their seats. These irregularities cause us real concern and deserve further scrutiny and a proper investigation. Sinn Fein owes it to all of us to clear up these matters once and for all, he added. A Sinn Fein spokesperson said Mr Varadkar#s comments were a disgrace and beneath the Office of the Taoiseach. These comments are completely fabricated and this is outrageous mud-slinging on the part of the caretaker Taoiseach who is clearly struggling to get to grips with the election results and this weekend#s opinion poll, he said. These disgraceful and baseless comments discredit the office of Taoiseach and Leo Varadkar really should reflect on them, he added.

Since launching in Belfast in , Co-Founders has delivered four cohorts involving  people who formed more than  teams - over  of whom are still working together. Twenty teams have received Proof of Concept funding, and eight teams have progressed to the full-time Propel pre-accelerator programme.Co-Founders has attracted software engineers, data scientists, sales and marketing experts, medical professionals, mechanical engineers, researchers, undergraduates and PhDs as well as people who have experienced a problem in a certain industry or from everyday le and want to develop a product to solve it.Participants in the new North West programme will have the added incentive of being in the running to win one of five pound, proof of concept grants from Innovate UK, the government’s innovation agency, which will be awarded to five teams with the best developed ideas at the end of the programme.Sonya Kerr, programme manager of Co-Founders, said Catalyst was hoping to attract  to  people from Derry, Letterkenny and across the North West to sign up.“We know there is a wealth of talent in the North West and a lot of people who have great ideas or are restless to try something new, who will really benefit from meeting others with dferent skills needed to build a start-up that they wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet,” she said.“Teams on Co-Founders are willing to try something dferent, meet new people and stretch themselves. We certainly don’t expect everyone to leave their jobs immediately and create a start-up but by helping people validate their ideas and build teams, it becomes a real option for many.”For example, of the nine teams who completed Catalyst’s first Co-Founders programme, three are still together and two have received over pound, in funding to build and launch their products.While on the programme, Co-Founder teams get access to co-working space within Catalyst to allow them to grow their own networks.Applications are now open for the programme at: co-founders.coThe deadline for applications for the North West programme is March . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The title of the book came from a question Ethan, who does not have autism, asked Mr Morrows mum when he was just three. Mr Morrow said he started writing the book to record his childhood and journey into fatherhood, after realising that most of the books on autism focused on children with the condition, not parents.It was a bit of a bucket list thing, to have a book published before I was ,”he said. I wanted to make a record of my early le and Ethans early le.Im proudly autistic now but that wasnt always the case.I used to try and hide it.After sending it off to a string of literary agents with no success, Jude self-published the book which has since earned a number of five star reviews and attracted the attention of one of the worlds leading consultants on autism, Maisie Soetantyo.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  also caught the eye of an American literary agent who took it to Beyond Words Publishing, the publisher behind the self help book The Secret.Impressed by Judes warts and all story which detailed his childhood struggle with autism through to adapting becoming a parent, they agreed to launch the book in the US with a speaking tour which will include a guest lecture at Calornias Stanford University.Beyond Words Publishing get submissions from all over the world but they only publish about  books a year so for them to publish my book is just unbelievable, said Jude.I never in my widest dreams thought this was going to happen. The publishers said the book resonates with people because its not about swimming the channel or climbing Everest, Im just a normal, relatable person.Im remarkably unremarkable but they thought it was important to get my story out there.Since publishing the book last year, Jude has given a series of talks and book signings which have given the -year-old social worker the chance to reach out to children with autism.I love meeting autistic kids,” he said,They are like me and I am like them.Im not in the business of giving parenting advice and when I give a talk to parents its always the kids who ask the questions.Theres a misconception that autistic kids dont know they are dferent.I want to tell them that things will be grand.He has also been contacted by people from around the world who have been touched by his story and he has encouraged anyone with questions to get in touch with him online.I reach out to people all the time and I have a black belt in responding, said Jude.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  is available on Amazon in both paper back and ebook.For more information see www.judemorrow or Jude Morrow Author on Facebook. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The title of the book came from a question Ethan, who does not have autism, asked Mr Morrows mum when he was just three. Mr Morrow said he started writing the book to record his childhood and journey into fatherhood, after realising that most of the books on autism focused on children with the condition, not parents.It was a bit of a bucket list thing, to have a book published before I was ,”he said. I wanted to make a record of my early le and Ethans early le.Im proudly autistic now but that wasnt always the case.I used to try and hide it.After sending it off to a string of literary agents with no success, Jude self-published the book which has since earned a number of five star reviews and attracted the attention of one of the worlds leading consultants on autism, Maisie Soetantyo.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  also caught the eye of an American literary agent who took it to Beyond Words Publishing, the publisher behind the self help book The Secret.Impressed by Judes warts and all story which detailed his childhood struggle with autism through to adapting becoming a parent, they agreed to launch the book in the US with a speaking tour which will include a guest lecture at Calornias Stanford University.Beyond Words Publishing get submissions from all over the world but they only publish about  books a year so for them to publish my book is just unbelievable, said Jude.I never in my widest dreams thought this was going to happen. The publishers said the book resonates with people because its not about swimming the channel or climbing Everest, Im just a normal, relatable person.Im remarkably unremarkable but they thought it was important to get my story out there.Since publishing the book last year, Jude has given a series of talks and book signings which have given the -year-old social worker the chance to reach out to children with autism.I love meeting autistic kids,” he said,They are like me and I am like them.Im not in the business of giving parenting advice and when I give a talk to parents its always the kids who ask the questions.Theres a misconception that autistic kids dont know they are dferent.I want to tell them that things will be grand.He has also been contacted by people from around the world who have been touched by his story and he has encouraged anyone with questions to get in touch with him online.I reach out to people all the time and I have a black belt in responding, said Jude.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  is available on Amazon in both paper back and ebook.For more information see www.judemorrow or Jude Morrow Author on Facebook. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

Derry City were left frustrated against Bohs continuously last season, picking up three points from four games against the Dubliners, with just one goal scored in the process. City have matched that points tally and bettered their goalalready and Devine insisted the points went to the better team.“Bohs are a very good side and let’s be honest, they’ve played three games in a week and we’ve played two and that’s not taking away anything from us,” he said. “Fair play to them, they came here and had a right good go, but I thought we were the dominant side, thought we were very much the team in control of the game and I think the players deserve huge credit again because they showed brilliant character and a desire to win the match.”The Candystripes are making a habit of scoring late goals, with Adam Liddle’s th minute goal against Finn Harps last week followed by Figueira’s nd minute strike on Friday. Derry City just keep going…“We have to. We have to,” Devine insisted. “The game lasts that long. These players worked extremely hard in pre-season and their fitness levels are really high. “The importance of the squad was shown again in the three guys who came on and had a huge impact. “We have a lot of talented players but we have to fight and scrap for every point we earn in this league. It is a tough league, an unforgiving league and we have got to play when we have got the ball and dig deep when we don’t. All in all it was a good night but we have to try and get better and keep moving forward and keep having that same appetite every Friday night we play.” googletag.cmd.push Key MomentDanny Lupano’s acrobatic goal-line clearance was a key moment in the game, and played a pivotal part in City securing their first clean sheet of the season. “It was a key moment but there were a lot of key moments,” Devine stated. “We had a couple of free headers Ally has a free header, Eoin Toal has a free header, so it works both ways. Our own downfall was giving the chance away that Danny has cleared, and what a clearance. Character is everything, quality is everything and an ability for people to attack and run to the very end the players deserve huge credit for. “There were a lot of square pegs in round holes but ultimately we have done a job and that’s all it is. “The players have been magnicent, I keep saying that, and they have been since January . “They will continue to get better andthey keep showing the appetite and hunger then that’s all I can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns

roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead. This advantage was quickly cancelled out by Gallagher, but Down continued to press and further scores from Liam Kerr and Barry OrsquoHagan sent the home side into the break with a - to - lead.Down controlled play at the start of the second half and points from OrsquoHare and Quinn stretched their lead to four points.However, no sooner had the Down supporters started to relax as their side moved well clear, when Longford roared back with - without reply to take a shock - to - lead.Connerton rocked the boat when he goaled out of nothing and when Dessie Reynolds and Gallaghertagged on points, the visitors were suddenly in the driving seat.Down now faced an uphill task, but they refused to panic and with  minutes gone Liam Kerr started the fightback with a point from play.Barry OrsquoHagan converted a free and it was suddenly all square again, but the predatory Quinn pounced to give Down a - to - lead with five minutes remaining with a well-worked goal.A free from Daniel Mimnagh another rsquo from Collum saw Longford trail by a single point with only a matter of minutes left on the clock.Down really went for broke at this stage and they were rewarded when James Guinness showed his versatility with a cool finish when he put the home side into an unassailable - to - lead with the  minutes almost up.Longford never stopped trying, but all they had to show for their efforts was another Mimnagh point.Down take to the road again this weekend when they head to OrsquoConnor Park to take on Offaly on Sunday afternoon for another must win game.Down: R Burns, S Annett, P Murdock, R McAleenan, G Collins, D OrsquoHagan , B McArdle, J Flynn , D Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , K McKernan , L KerrD OrsquoHare , A Morgan, C Quinn .

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it. His night time routine included a walk up around Portadown. But when family became concerned for his safety, he assured them that nobody would touch him and that he always carried his walking stick anyhow.As an avid Edenderry man, Joe was heavily involved in the generational annual construction of Edenderry arch. Mr Roney’s funeral was on Monday February  in Seagoe Parish Church following by interment in Seagoe Cemetery.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"womens day prayer portadown ","story":"PSNI appeal as NI girlis missingChristian outreach worker among four NI weekend road fatalitiesNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleWomen’s Day of Prayer in PortadownFINAL preparations are being made for the Women’s World Day of Prayer in Portadown.By Carmel RobinsonMonday, nd March , : am\"\"Church Steeple and CrossWorld Day of Prayer will be taking place inEdenderry Methodist Church this Friday, March .The focus is on Zimbabwe and women from all over the world will be reflecting on the dficulties and unrest that have plagued that country over the years.A considerable lot of hard work has gone into organising the Edenderry service and the church decorations will reflect le in Zimbabwe.World Day of Prayer is an international inter-church organisation which enables everyone to hear the thoughts of women from all parts ofthe world.

And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
