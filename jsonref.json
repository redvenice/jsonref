He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.There is something about what he calls the “chaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians” that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. “I was always interested in shooting single photographs,” he says, “which show worlds and stories in one image.” He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. “I think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.”Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort will be published by Kerber Verlag (£36) later this spring"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d6e1cbf8c6f598c91c906a5b68cff9893ea067/0_60_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4674627f9d0a2dc40ad35a5df5a1ba41","title":"sitopia by carolyn steel review big questions about food","story":"To live better we need to see food as more than a commodity, argues the author of Hungry City in this ambitious ‘all-you-can-eat buffet of thoughts’In the opening passages of Sitopia, Carolyn Steel talks about the “Google Burger”, a €250,000 (£218,000) prototype piece of cultured meat, grown in a laboratory from bovine stem cells, with backing from, among others, Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin. This technology may, as George Monbiot has recently argued, help to save the world, but Steel is sceptical. She mistrusts the urge to find a technical fix, especially one that would put tech giants in charge of the world’s diets. Wouldn’t it be easier, she asks, if we just ate more vegetables?To which the answer is both yes and no. Eating more vegetables is not difficult. The hard part is silencing all those cravings – biological, cultural, psychological – that urge people to eat a lot of meat. The still harder part, once some virtuous souls have disciplined themselves away from animal products, is to persuade billions of other people, for many of whom plentiful meat is a newlydiscovered and hard-earned luxury, to do the same.Rather than apply technology to problems that modern society has created, Steel argues, it is important to address the patterns of thinking that got us into this mess in the first place. The issues are philosophical as well as technical, and personal and global at once. Food is “the substance that connects us to one another and to our world”. Food is also love: “for social animals like us, the sharing of food will always be central to bonding with others … Throughout our lives, the chance to show our love through food lies in every meal that we grow, cook and eat. It is the basis not just of a good life, but of being human.”Steel is an architect by training, whom I have known since we studied the subject together at university, and her thinking reflects a lesson we both learned: that different forms of knowledge and experience – in a building or in life – should be considered not in separate categories, but together and in the round. The concept of “Sitopia”, a term coined by Steel in her earlier book Hungry City, is that if we can eat well (and cook well and farm well) we are on the way to living well. Where Utopia is abstract and impossible, Sitopia is both grounded in daily experience and achievable: “working with food is the perfect antidote to living in our virtual, dematerialised world”. It should also give pleasure. Food, in Steel’s world, is always to be enjoyed.The beauty of food is that it is so many things at once: necessity and treat, nature and artifice, the subject of science, philosophy, etiquette and art. The book is accordingly multiple in its themes, an all-you-can-eat buffet of thoughts and facts about food, drawing on (for example) the philosophies of Epicurus and Aristotle, some fascinating information about microbes and foraging, and reminiscences of childhood visits to the author’s cousins’ old-fashioned farm in Finland.Steel opposes those forms of science and economics that insist on ision, thereby dismembering food’s ability to combine different aspects of life. Neoliberalism’s view of food as just another commodity, combined with mechanistic science, has, Steel believes, brought the world to its current state: one where food production contributes to climate change, where soil is impoverished, farm animals tortured and bioersity ravaged, all in a desperate chase to produce food that, in developed countries, is often thrown away. Or, if it is not, it contributes to crises of obesity and related health issues.Steel’s proposal is that food should be honoured by iniduals and economies. From production to consumption, it should be given time, with a long-term view of such things as the quality of soil. What this means in practice is to some extent a return to old habits: sharing meals, more local distribution, smaller-scale production and more labour-intensive farming, although Steel does allow technology – the use of drones to survey crops, for example – some role. We have, she says, become dependent on cheap food, the price of which is only achieved by ignoring environmental degradation.In all of this, a big and not entirely answered question is who, exactly, are “we”? Steel makes enthusiastic use of the first-person plural, wielding a protean pronoun that at different times means “we the human race,” “we inhabitants of the western world” and “we the educated and relatively comfortable people who are most likely to read or write a book like this”. Its slipperiness causes most trouble when she argues that “we” should pay the true cost of food, which might be double current prices. This will be bad news for those of “us” who already struggle to get enough to eat.Steel spots the problem and tries to address it, by suggesting that the employment opportunities offered by Sitopian farming will generate incomes enough to pay for Sitopian food. She’s a little sketchy, though, as to how this new state of affairs will come about.Steel is not an economist, nor an agronomist. Not very surprisingly, she doesn’t have all the answers to the huge questions she asks. But her instincts are profoundly right – food is indeed more than fuel – and this is a brave and ambitious book for stating them so strongly. She speaks, for sure, mostly to the privileged, but if the privileged can’t make a start in eating and living better, who can?• Sitopia is published by Chatto (£16.99).

Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air.Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.“The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.”This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people.However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.“You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.”The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.“The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.” A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371b3e51089071d9b822cc41a14fa7c753a040cd/36_56_3093_1858/master/3093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=918134b5ca79f07350d053d11821f096","title":"pressure intensifies for 100 government backed business loans","story":"Bank governors join Ed Miliband in urging Rishi Sunak to cut out the banks and ramp up the Covid-19 lifeboat schemeAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was a matter of urgency that the Treasury simplify the system to allow more businesses to access the one-year, interest-free loans.It would be “an important part of the mix” of loans and grants on offer to rescue firms, she said.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested that a government guarantee for loans under £25,000 might be the only way to circumvent standard bank credit checks.The latest figures from the finance industry show banks have received around 28,000 loan applications under the month-old scheme, and agreed to make 6,000 loans. It is not known if the remaining 22,000 applicants have been rejected or are still waiting to find out how their application has fared.Last week shadow business secretary Ed Miliband urged the business secretary Alok Sharma to overhaul the Cbils loans scheme, or risk thousands of firms going under.At the time, business leaders were reticent to back Miliband’s call, but over the last week the low level of applications and loan agreements has spurred them on to demand a rethink.Treasury officials are understood to be reluctant to underwrite all loans to small businesses, fearing the system could be abused. They are, however, discussing with business groups how to improve the loans system following criticism that banks have applied strict lending criteria, preventing firms from accessing loans.In particular, banks must ask whether borrowers can afford to repay the loans, which can be made over a six-year period.Miliband said it was “almost impossible” for many companies to answer the question when the current crisis meant there was so much uncertainty.“The fate of many businesses lie in the decisions the chancellor makes over the coming days. He needs to act now, or businesses will begin to go to the wall in increasing numbers.Last week, the Treasury extended the CBILS scheme to all viable businesses with turnover of £45m-£250m, which can apply for government-backed loans of up to £25m. Firms with a turnover of more than £250m will be allowed to borrow up to £50m from lenders."},{"url":null,"title":"have you been affected coronavirus anywhere but westminster","story":"For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you As the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.Do you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

There’s a BE KIND Ellen hat. A BE KIND wine tote. A BE KIND subscription box. There are even BE KIND face masks – so you can try killing the coronavirus with kindness.Shockingly, it seems that DeGeneres might not always practice what she preaches: crew members on her talkshow are reportedly furious over the not-so-kind way they’ve been treated during the coronavirus crisis. According to Variety, the core stage crew for the Ellen DeGeneres Show are frustrated that they haven’t received written communication about the status of their hours or pay. They were also less than thrilled to discover, via social media, that an outside, non-union, tech company had been hired to help DeGeneres film her show remotely from her home. This stung as DeGeneres had recently announced on-air that she wanted to start filming again as soon as possible so she could support her staff and crew.DeGeneres isn’t personally responsible for every aspect of how her show is run, of course. But it certainly seems like a woman who is reportedly worth more than $330m and is one of the highest-paid stars on television, earning more than $50m a year, could be doing rather more to support the people who work under her. Particularly as many of her crew have worked on the show since it started 17 years ago. It’s worth noting that Jimmy Kimmel Live! stagehands, according to Variety, were paid from Kimmel’s own pocket during initial coronavirus shutdowns.Why is DeGeneres suddenly getting so much backlash and bad press? Well, for one thing, coronavirus has made us all sick to death of celebrity shenanigans. It’s hard for stars to seem relatable when they’re moaning about their mansions.More broadly, however, I think some of the animosity towards DeGeneres has to do with the way she exemplifies the hypocrisy around the concept of “civility”. Last year, for example, DeGeneres lectured us all on her friendship with George W Bush, a man who opposed same-sex marriage and whose own former counter-terrorism chief accused him of committing war crimes. “When I say, ‘Be kind to one another’, I don’t mean only the people who think the same way that you do,” DeGeneres said on her show, in response to criticism of her hobnobbing with Bush. “I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn’t matter.”I don’t want to completely slam DeGeneres. She’s done a lot of good in the world. It’s hard to overstate how brave it was for her to come out in 1997 her courage made life a lot easier for the next generation of queer people. According to a 2015 poll, Ellen did more to influence Americans’ attitudes about gay rights than any other celebrity or public figure. But if she wants to keep flogging merchandise with BE KIND on it, then she might want to start thinking a little harder about what those words actually mean. And I say that in the kindest possible way.Karen Ingala Smith, the founder of Counting Dead Women, a project that records the killing of women by men, has identified at least 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the UK since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed. The same period last year saw an average of five deaths. “The number of women killed by men over the first three weeks since lockdown is the highest it’s been for at least 11 years and is double that of an average 21 days over the last 10 years,” Smith said.“Those lucky enough to be in a position to stay at home, please, please do so,” the first daughter recently tweeted. Ivanka then flew from Washington DC to the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey to celebrate Passover.Laura Daniel, a New Zealand comedian, attempted to create Jacinda Ardern in cake form during a baking competition as a tribute to the prime minister. Let’s just say that the final result wasn’t exactly flattering. “Don’t bake your heroes,” Daniel advised.“A British woman in a long-term relationship with a 92-year-old German chandelier has been told that her attraction to historic light fittings is not considered to be a protected sexual orientation,” the  reports. Some light relief in these dark times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2afbc340ffd62d074be61b5116e92e9bcba0c86/104_0_2112_1267/master/2112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2f2ee530f805f7a972dfd4fcb0b52","title":"coronavirus complications december brexit","story":"Given the pandemic’s likely impact on world trade, we should amend the December deadlineCovid-19 has changed how we interact as a society. But it is harder to know what the repercussions will be for international trade. The prospectus for Brexit was based, in part, on the trading opportunities waiting to be seized by “global Britain”. How does Covid-19 change the balance of risks and opportunities that face us?Economies, like societies, are complex networks of direct and indirect relationships. We may be fairly confident in the health of our immediate trading partners, but as important is the health of the partners they trade with. Covid-19 causes deep problems. Supply chains locate production across the world to maximise efficiency. Unsurprisingly, the WTO expects trade to fall more in sectors with complex value chains.Equally, the movement of people is fundamental to how we trade services. We have to set up a shop, attract students or locate management. Eight out of 10 UK jobs are in the services sector. Services account for about half our total trade. Yet travel restrictions now apply in 150 countries. They are likely to be lifted slowly, as some nations control the pandemic more quickly than others. Early signs are not encouraging. JP Morgan’s global purchasing managers index shows the fall in services export orders much greater than for manufactured goods.Our ability to specialise creates the gains from trade, but it has also created a vulnerability. The WTO rules permit temporary export prohibitions to relieve critical shortages. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic 40 nations have introduced export restrictions on medical equipment. Trade specialist Simon Evenett calls these sicken-thy-neighbour policies. What will this do for trust and reciprocation after the heath crisis has passed?The impact of the pandemic on global trade, in other words, might well be longer term. Beata Javorcik, the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has pointed out that resilience will in future be a key concern for businesses, which might imply some degree of reshoring and potentially moving away from holding near-zero inventories so as to hedge against the possibility of future disruptions to supply chains. The chief executive of Bosch has expressed concern about the future of the company’s supply chain.In times of economic hardship, the temptation to turn inwards and play the nationalism card has proved too tempting.Which brings us to Brexit. The transition period agreed in the EU withdrawal agreement and passed by parliament in January provides for frictionless access to the European market and its trading partners until 31 December. This is why leaving the EU has changed relatively little on the ground. The government has until 30 June to decide whether to request and pass legislation allowing an extension of the transition period by one or two years, or leave the single market and customs union by year end, with or without a trade deal.Some argue that the pandemic strengthens the case to end transition, to free us to sign new free trade agreements around the world in order to revive our recuperating economy. This requires us to rediscover our competitive spirit and reach a mutually favourable agreement with the US and the other nations that will follow.However, these arguments are unpersuasive. Essentially, they amount to sacrificing our existing trading relationship with the EU, accounting for about half our total trade, for hypothetical and problematic future deals with the US and others in very short order. Given the uncertainty about the future of world trade, this would be a risky moment to make trade with by far our biggest trading partner more difficult, while pinning our hopes on being able to increase trade with the rest of the world.The disruption caused by the pandemic makes it unlikely that a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and EU can be secured before the transition period ends. Surely, under such circumstances, it makes sense to take advantage of the opportunity to extend afforded us by the withdrawal agreement? This certainly seems to be the view of the British public: twice as many think the prime minister should amend his 31 December deadline than do not. Of course, there is a political rationale for the government to fulfil its promise to deliver the end of transition on time. Yet, given what the pandemic has done – and may yet do - to the global economy, there’s an equally strong, if not stronger, practical one for reconsidering.• Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europe• Angus Armstrong is director of the Rebuilding Macroeconomics network, NIESR"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3929097d89bb267ba6f080643c49bdb5af330a65/0_26_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4073bb042488eaee44e3bbcfb97a0f3a","title":"whats going on out there you may as well ask a pigeon","story":"Who can claim, viewing the world through the thin slit of their bedroom window, to really know what’s happening?Here inside, I am losing it. I watched Carry on Screaming and enjoyed it unreservedly. My right arm seems to have stopped working, making it difficult to do Nazi salutes at the television whenever a government minister comes on. And I found myself asking a pigeon, sitting on the fence outside the kitchen window, how it was getting on in the current situation. And then answering my own question about the pigeon’s welfare myself, in a stupid Eric Idle accent, presumably the supposed voice of the pigeon, as if it were talking to me. “I’m very well thank you Stewart and as a full-time denizen of the sky I am enjoying the improvement in London’s air quality enormously. Funny how you never see baby pigeons, isn’t it?” I shut the back door and went inside to seek solace in teabags and memories.I am glad I started out as the multiple-award-winning standup I am today on what was then the “alternative” comedy circuit, at the tail-end of the 80s, back before the bills became homogenised into our modern, TV-friendly fare. And when you were still allowed to go outside. “Remember white dog shit? Remember any dog shit at all? Remember colours? Things? Remember when each day was different to the last? The unexpected smell of farts that weren’t your own? What was that all about?”There is much that modern comedians have noticed, it seems, and a large amount of it is common to all our experience. Or at least it was, before your experience became either being inside or struggling selflessly in underequipped hospitals for a government that appears to have abandoned you. “Is it really necessary to dissolve stock cubes or can you just chew them up as a snack? Have you ever noticed, right, that if you close your eyes and grit your teeth you can actually hear time passing in slow, throbbing waves? And have you ever noticed, right, that when you’ve been forced to work a Covid ward without any protection, if you threaten to tell anyone they say they’ll sack you? Thank you and goodnight! I’m here indefinitely!! Try the stock cubes!!!”In the old comedy circuit days of the late 80s, I remember performing at the now demolished Red Rose, which ran out of the function room of a Labour club in Finsbury Park, on a bill with an act that didn’t even make the concession of actually appearing on the stage, its slightly raised platform being too restrictive a space, with its neocolonial lights and patriarchal microphone. Instead, the usual, heady mix of social workers and squatters had to view her in an alcove by the door as they left the venue between sets, subverting the whole idea of where a performance began and ended, questioning the relative status of audience and performer, and causing a problematic blockage in the corridor by the gents.A naked, middle-aged woman was curled up inside a box, which was mounted on stilts and lined with vaudevillian velvet, and she had invited us to look into it through a little hole. This aperture had a powerful magnifying glass lens on it, meaning that while you saw what was obviously flesh, you could have no idea which part of the anatomy you were actually looking at. It was a great gag, the sort of thing that might have won a Turner prize if it had been presented in a more respectable venue by someone with a degree, the process presumably intending to parody our voyeuristic instincts generally, and the male gaze specifically. Technically, the desire to see the subject was fulfilled, but in such closeup as to render it completely indistinct.It also strikes me, more than three decades later, as an unexpectedly apposite metaphor for the current situation. For who can claim, viewing the world through the smeared lens of Sky News or the thin slit of their bedroom window, to really know what the fuck is going on out there? Is that Matt Handcock’s face, or a part of a naked person’s armpit seen through a high-powered magnifying glass? Is that Donald Trump, or one of those tiny swollen bugs that lives in eyebrows, feeding on dandruff, and descends to the facemeat only to die? Is this the end of world as we know it, or just harmless dirt that has formed a hardened crust behind a human ear?I knew the situation on the wards was worse than reported because a relative told me in emails. And I knew about the care home death tolls because another online correspondent has gone back to working in them. And a man whose record I once reviewed has reported to me from a sealed cellar in New York City. I store these particles of information for posterity, to piece into a full picture posthumously.Upstairs, I look out of the skylight periodically. Bin bags disappear on Tuesdays. The cranes by the reservoir rarely revolve. Last week, an Orthodox Jew walked past carrying a mini fire extinguisher. And I thought I saw Miriam Margolyes on the top deck of a bus, eating a Cornetto.

Eventually, the authorities impounded their car and auctioned it off to cover the fines.But the stunt attracted massive media attention, and the point was made. Soon after, electric vehicles were exempted from road tolls, one of a large raft of incentives that have, over the years, helped make Norway the country with the world’s highest per capita electric vehicle ownership.It still has some way to go, but the country looks on course to meet a government target – set in 2016, with full cross-party parliamentary support – of phasing out the sale of all new fossil-fuel based cars and light commercial vehicles by 2025.“It’s actually quite amazing how fast the mindset’s changed,” said Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Electric Vehicle Association. “Even in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric.”The story of how and why that has happened has a straightforward, if unexpected logic. First, despite being a major oil and gas producer, almost all of Norway’s domestic energy comes from a single, and renewable, source: hydropower.That means switching to EVs is a much greener option for Norway than for countries whose power is generated mostly by coal plants – and that if it wants to significantly reduce its emission levels, it has little choice but to green its transport sector.Driven by the environmental imperative, the government began offering incentives to buy and run electric cars as far back as 1990, first by introducing a temporary exemption from Norway’s exorbitant vehicle purchase tax, which became permanent six years later.“This was an important step,” Bu said. “Norway was a very poor country before we discovered oil cars were a luxury item. They’ve always been taxed very highly. Cars in Norway are a lot more expensive than elsewhere. Without the purchase tax, the cost of an electric car basically fell to that of an ordinary car.”Since then, electric car drivers have been given the right to park for free in some municipal car parks, drive in bus lanes, take ferries without a ticket and, thanks to A-ha, drive toll-free. They are not required to pay VAT on their cars, or road tax, and company electric cars are taxed at a lower rate than petrol or diesel vehicles.But overall, said Bu, the “combination of a big one-off saving when you buy the car, plus the substantially lower costs – fuel, tolls, parking, maintenance – of actually driving it, still adds up to a very powerful financial argument. Over its lifetime, you really save a lot of money with an electric car in Norway.”That was certainly what persuaded Wenche Charlotte Egelund, 57, who bought a VW Golf Electric with her partner two years ago when they moved out of central Oslo. “The incentives were crucial,” she said. “The tax and VAT exemptions, free municipal parking, free toll roads that mean we avoid the rush-hour traffic jams.”In fact, Egelund said, the incentives were so significant that she almost “felt the decision was imposed on me. Financially, it was like there was no other sensible option. I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?”Rachel Ritman, 56, a postwoman living on the outskirts of Fredrikstad, bought her Opel Ampera two years ago and said she has not regretted her choice, even if she was “not sure we would have gone electric without the incentives”. The car’s range was good, she said: 250 miles (400km) in summer, 200 miles (320km) in winter and because she charges at home she does not suffer from “lade-angst”, or the fear of running out of juice.Both Ritman and Egelund have a second, diesel-powered car for extra-long journeys, to country cabins or holidays. Sten Bråthen, 55, a media consultant, bought his Nissan Leaf as a second car “for taking the children around and driving to work. But there were so many advantages that when we were getting a new main car last year we didn’t think twice about going electric.”Government incentives were vital in the decision to buy, Bråthen said: “I think we would have managed without the other incentives – free toll roads and parking – but the actual cost of buying was so much lower than ordinary cars here in Norway.” He warned, though, that Norway was going to need more charging stations.Despite the incentives, EV sales in Norway remained low until about 2010, when a number of smaller, more affordable electric cars from makers such as Mitsubishi and Nissan came to market, and improved technology meant larger electric cars began to offer both the space and range to make them a sensible choice for families.Bu said the incentives were so significant that “many people say they’ve bought the most expensive car they’ve ever had when they buy electric – Teslas, Jaguars, that kind of model – simply because they’ve calculated what kind of saving they’re going to be making over the coming years, and feel it makes sense”.That has led to accusations that Norway’s encouragement of electric vehicles amounts to little more than tax cuts for the rich, or a cut-price second car. Many Norwegians on lower incomes can only dream of owning an electric car, and three out of four car purchases are on the secondhand market.She said she was confident for the future of electric vehicles, even in countries without a big renewable power sector, and studies show that EVs running on power generated from fossil fuel are responsible for roughly the same level of overall CO2 emissions as petrol cars.Electric cars are “never going to be truly environmentally friendly”, Bu said. “The main problem is making the batteries. We need clean battery producers in Europe. But look, we need transport. We need cars and vans, particularly outside our cities. And for us, electric is the answer.”This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.  is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to strengthening coverage of the climate story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f66bafbc111756a5a474a4c4ceff8c7275d2e6/0_69_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4910b12c30eac72a20261c1d05e84765","title":"selah and the spades review tayarisha poe lovie simone jharrel jerome","story":"This arresting debut about a high-school ‘queen bee’ nurturing her successor-in-crime heralds a singular new talent in director Tayarisha PoeWriter-director Tayarisha Poe has wryly described her debut feature (which played to enthusiastic responses at Sundance last year) as “Clueless meets The Godfather”. Set amid the five warring factions of an elite east coast US boarding school, it’s a woozy, hallucinogenic drama that reimagines the landscape of high school as a a daytime-noir terrain of crime and punishment, tangentially reminiscent of the life-and-death struggles of Rian Johnson’s arresting 2005 debut Brick. Picked up by Amazon, which swiftly started developing a spin-off TV project, Selah and the Spades is an audacious calling card for Poe, marking her down as a major talent to watch.Lovie Simone exudes a brooding sense of purpose as Selah Summers, leader of the titular pack who run Haldwell school’s thriving supply of illicit substances. It’s the spring term of her senior year, and Selah, who will soon be leaving Haldwell, is looking for someone to whom she can pass the baton of power, to “ensure her legacy”. She thinks she’s found the perfect candidate in upcoming shutterbug Paloma (Celeste O’Connor), whom Selah imagines that she can “teach”, or mould in her own image (inevitable shades of Jane Austen’s endlessly reinterpretable Emma). But tensions are rising between Selah and her right-hand man Maxxie (Moonlight’s Jharrel Jerome), threatening the stability of her empire, and revealing cracks in Selah’s otherwise ice-cool exterior.Beginning life as an online multimedia project in 2014, Selah and the Spades reportedly grew out of Poe’s response to a period of disaffection while working in a digital tech lab. “I wanted to tell a story about a girl who knew what she wanted,” she told Filmmaker magazine in 2015, characterising her anti-heroine as “a girl who runs a gang and is totally OK with doing whatever she needs to do to make that gang successful”.Yet perfectionist Selah’s confidence only extends as far as the boundaries of the insular school grounds. In a telling scene with her quietly scolding mother, we see that Selah (who has a dark secret in her past) can be just as scared as her contemporaries of what awaits her when this particular dream is over. “It will put you in your place,” her mother tells her, “it will keep you safe from yourself”, adding curtly that “something has to”. But Selah doesn’t need reminding that what she has is transient, and that her queen bee, straight-A status may not be sustainable for long. All the more reason to live it to the full while it lasts…Citing Fran Ross’s 1974 novel Oreo and Geoffrey Fletcher’s 2011 film Violet \u0026amp Daisy as influences, Poe has created something that is simultaneously familiar and surprising – combining the hazy nature of teenage years with the more brutal power struggles of adult life, thrown together in a larger-than-life environment that is utterly artificial but still grounded in down-to-earth reality. At times, I was reminded of the rebellious spirit of Céline Sciamma’s Girlhood (Bande des filles), a vivid coming-of-age story that viewed its rites of passage through the prism of a Parisian girl gang. But this is altogether more surreal, a quality emphasised by Jomo Fray’s richly saturated cinematography, which floats ethereally down confined corridors, up candlelit staircases, and through idyllic woodland retreats, drenching the screen in verdant hues that contrast sharply with the satirical bite of the action.There’s an equally expressionist edge to the soundtrack, which jumbles hard-cut jukebox selections with almost sci-fi-inflected tonal mood-scapes, weaving in and out of the dialogue. At times, composer Aska Matsumiya’s beautifully off-kilter cues reminded me of Jon Brion’s disorienting work on Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love, the layered sound-design lending an air of tension to even the most apparently innocuous scenes.As with many first features, there are some shortcomings. At times, it’s hard to tell whether the contrivances of the script and the stiltedness of some of the performances are archly deliberate or accidental, a quality that can break the spell of the movie’s trancey atmosphere. During these moments, it’s tempting to view Selah and the Spades as a triumph of style over substance, richer in visual promise than thematic rewards.Yet there’s also something thrilling about Poe’s refusal to smooth the odd and potentially alienating edges off this very personal (and ultimately empowering) drama, suggesting a strength of creative purpose that will doubtless pay great idends. She has a voice that is clearly her own, and a future that looks bright indeed.

Jay Rayner looks back on a match made in heavenOn a June day in 1992, with enough blue sky to fill a beach holiday, I attended the best-catered wedding I have ever been to. There was a buffet of whole pewter-skinned salmon baked in olive oil, slabs of grilled chorizo punchy with paprika and a hit of chilli, and rustic salads heavy with rocket. Frankly, the quality was a relief, because that wedding was my own. The chef was David Eyre and the open kitchen he was cooking from, an early iteration of its kind, belonged to the Eagle on Farringdon Road in London, catering their first ever nuptials. Regularly, it’s cited as Britain’s original gastropub. Eyre and his business partner, the restaurateur Michael Belben, had acquired the knackered site right next to the ’s then offices only 18 months before.Accordingly, next year marks the 30th anniversary of a movement that has shaped Britain’s food landscape, and dispatched an awful lot of lamb shanks in the process. For all its many positives – who doesn’t like mismatched furniture and a bowl of artisanal pork scratchings? – it’s not been universally popular. Even the word “gastropub” infuriates some. Rob Shaw, the restaurateur behind brilliant stalwarts such as the Anchor and Hope in London and Oxford’s Magdalen Arms, told me he found it “cringe-worthy”. Having raised boys through their teenage years, thus spending many meal times being told that most things I do are “cringe-worthy”, including breathing, I feel a certain fellowship with anything dismissed in such a way.I asked for a definition of the term from Ed Beddington, editor of pub trade journal the Morning Advertiser, which runs the 50 Best Gastropubs awards. He said: “It’s a pub that focuses heavily on food, but where you can still get a pint.” That certainly describes the Eagle, even though it looked nothing like a standard London boozer. “Nowhere else had blackboard menus on the walls,” says Tom Norrington-Davies, one of only three chefs to have run the kitchen there. “There were bare floorboards, no flock wallpaper, and it served a steak sandwich.” Indeed it did: the  was sustained by that extremely good value Portuguese-inspired bife ana: rump marinated in red wine, garlic and chilli, grilled and stuffed inside a crusty roll.Some insist the Eagle wasn’t the first food pub. They point to places like the Walnut Tree near Monmouth where Franco Taruschio cooked boisterous rustic Italian dishes from 1963 until the early 1990s. But he had full waiter service. At the Eagle you placed your order at the crowded bar, elbow to rib, and marvelled at the staff’s ability to find you in your corner of the crammed room.The Eagle’s midwife was a change in the law, forcing the mega-breweries to est themselves of a slab of their tied properties. Pubs suddenly became cheap. Here, then, was a business model: low rents, bare-bone fit-outs mostly involving a sander, and booze sales to subsidise the kitchen. Quickly, it caught on. These were indeed the braised lamb shank years. And the pork belly years. And the sausages in onion gravy years. Once humble, perhaps overlooked, ingredients got loving care and attention. Supermarkets would eventually launch gastropub ready-meal ranges based upon them.The result was a very British kind of culture war: people who loved their old boozers complained that they were being cleansed from them by culinary gentrification that also made once cheap ingredients expensive. Meanwhile, middle-class tossers like me who’d never felt especially comfortable in the saloon bar gave thanks that there was now a ready source of wasabi peas and over-oaked Chilean chardonnay.As ever, something more complex was going on. In 1999, self-taught chef Stephen Harris took over a blocky old pub overlooking the sea near Whitstable, called the Sportsman. “I was just a chef looking for somewhere to cook,” he says now. A pub turned out to be a great idea. “Personally, I love eating out and everything that goes with it, but I think a lot of British people are inherently suspicious of restaurants with their fancy waiters and all that. The pub setting allows people to come in, have a pint and see what they think before committing.”It also focused Harris’s thoughts. “I started out doing brushed-up country cooking.” It was asparagus soup with a soft-boiled egg and soldiers, followed by braised pork belly stuffed with black pudding. “I wanted to progress and refine, but I was aware of it being a pub. It was a constant tightrope walk.” In 2005, he launched a tasting menu, complete with an intense crab risotto and a rhubarb and elderflower sorbet made from ingredients growing just outside the back door. In 2008, the Sportsman won a Michelin star. “The tasting menu was justified by everything coming from nearby,” Harris says. “It was a pub serving its purpose as a local.”Other pubs got serious attention from the guides: there was the Angel at Hetton and in London the Harwood Arms with its look-at-me venison scotch eggs. But for most food pubs the ambitions have always remained more modest. Outside of urban areas, Britain’s gastropubs have become the equivalent of France’s country inns, a source of reliable, unchallenging food: a terrine or risotto to start a sea bass or pork belly dish for mains a chocolate fondant, a crème brûlée or a lemon tart to finish. This, now, is Britain’s standard menu. Elsewhere, the pub has simply become a vessel for great food. At one point, a bunch of central London pubs installed Thai chefs. Both west London and Birmingham have seen the rise of Desi pubs, offering stonking tandoori grills, curries and roti.But, like the Harwood Arms’s scotch egg, there’s always a place for traditional pub food, re-engineered to be so much better than the originals. At Lancashire’s Cartford Inn I swooned over their oxtail, beef skirt and suet pudding and declared it the exemplar of a style that should be called, with Wildean wit, Gravy Moderne. Something similar has long been going on at the Parker’s Arms near Clitheroe, where chef Stosie Madi makes a killer black pudding sausage roll and, to finish, a wet nelly tart with custard on the side. Yes. And please. In short, the gastropub is now whatever we want it to be. As Stephen Harris says, “It doesn’t matter what you serve, as long as you do it well.” And the Eagle’s bife ana steak sandwich? That has survived these past 29 years. As has the marriage. Who doesn’t love a bit of continuity?Many gastropubs are now running food take-away and delivery services. Do check whether your local is one of them. The Red Lion and Sun in London’s Highgate, which features on the 50 Best Gastropub list, is running an extensive service with the kitchen open from 4pm until 9pm from Tuesday to Friday, and from noon at weekends. The menu includes braised shoulder of beef with mash, salmon niçoise and Korean fried chicken wings (redlionandsun). Meanwhile, in Bristol the ever-popular Cauldron is delivering Sunday lunch. Orders are taken from 9am Friday, until they run out. Expect beef, pork, roast potatoes and cauliflower cheese, with a brownie to finish ( thecauldron.restaurant).For a broader range of restaurants and food shops that are now delivering, try myvirtualneighbourhood.

He might also recall Stéphane Guivarc’h, who led the line for France in 1998. For their two World Cup triumphs, France have had centre-forwards who went through the whole tournaments without finding the net. In the early 90s, on the other hand, they had one of the deadliest finishers the game has seen – and they made fools of themselves on the international stage. Go-kart? Go figure.Jean-Pierre Papin won the Ballon d’Or by a landslide in 1991 and, despite Neymar’s best efforts, remains the only player to receive that accolade while playing for a French club. But his reputation has withered a little and, outside France, he is perhaps the least well remembered recipient of the award for the past 30 years because he never made a mark on a major tournament.France flopped repeatedly and absurdly when he was in his prime even though he struck 34 times in 50 appearances for his country. At club level Marseille were one of the most thrilling teams in Europe when he was firing in goals for them and even reached the Champions League final in 1991 but when they finally won the tournament in 1993, Papin was a playing-substitute for the opposition, Milan. So Papin, even more than the injury-riddled Michael Owen, is the player who inspires the question: can a Ballon d’Or winner be a nearly man?But pondering does not seem right when it comes to Papin, because what made him so dangerous and exciting was the complete absence of contemplation in the way he played: when he got the ball he just lashed it into the net, from any distance, any angle, with any part of his body. A geometry teacher would think he was cheating because he never seemed to do any calculations before finishing with flawless precision.But he worked at it, all right. When he collected his Ballon d’Or in 1991 he dedicated the award to Alain Casanova, the Marseille reserve goalkeeper who for years would stay behind with him after training, often late into the night when the pitch was illuminated only by the headlights of the striker’s car. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200413-55140-gnl.fw.200413.jf.italy3v2brazil.mp3 There is a particularly spectacular type of finish that is still referred to in France as “une papinade”. The definition is disputed: it definitely denotes a powerful volley but some insist it has to be from outrageously far out and a difficult angle. Alain Pécheral, a journalist with Le Provençal, popularised the term after seeing the striker score an extraordinary goal for Marseille against Niort in 1988. A lofted pass came in from the left and Papin, coming in from the right, walloped it first time past a stunned goalkeeper from 20 yards.Pécheral had seen Papin do the same thing against Racing de Paris a couple of years earlier and decided the player deserved to have the technique trademarked. “The papinade cannot be explained, cannot be planned and cannot be taught,” wrote Pécheral. “It is something unique to this fellow, his neurons, this amazing feeling that he has with the ball that enables him to gauge, like a computer, the trajectory, speed and weight of the object before instantaneously working out the angle of the shot and the exact dosage to apply. In a papinade there is magic, something unreal and, most of all, an accumulation of work and observation added to an explosive physique and a granite mentality.”Years later, all Papin said about the goal against Niort was that it was the result of his work with Casanova. “There was nothing spontaneous about it,” he said. “It was just that I had done it so many times while practising that I no longer had to wonder about taking the ball down, I could just hit it first time.”At this point it should be noted that there are some folks who claim “papinade” was originally used by Marseille fans to mean an outlandish miss. Papin, you see, got off to a good start with them after joining from Bruges after the 1986 World Cup but his goals dried up as his first season wore on and he racked up miss after miss, just as he had done on his World Cup debut against Canada, when he struck the winner only after squandering enough chances to have secured the Golden Boot in one match. By the end of his first season at Marseille, JPP was said by critics to stand for “J’en peux plus (“I can’t do it any more”).All of which made what followed more admirable, as Papin became Ligue 1 top scorer for five years in a row before joining Milan for a world record £10m. He had turned himself into a sharply honed scoring ninja, able to immediately identify and execute the best way of propelling the ball into the net from wherever he happened to receive it.Samuel Eto’o was once asked what the secret to scoring lots of goals was and replied: “Having lots of shots.” Sure, Papin missed chances but he also scored lots of goals (157 in 244 matches for Marseille, 25 in 54 for Milan) – and many came from what most players would not even have classed as opportunities. There was, for example, a preposterous header he scored for Milan against Sampdoria where he powered the ball past the goalkeeper from 12 yards after ing under the foot of the last defender.But volleys were his greatest trick. Their crispness, power and accuracy. Everyone knew what he was capable of, but keepers kept being caught by surprise all the same. He scored a particularly improbable one against Spain when a deflection on a cross from Manuel Amoros forced him to adjust so that he stuck out his right leg while falling backwards and, through a perfectly calibrated swivelling of the ankle, guided a volley into the net.That was in the qualifiers for Euro 92, for which France arrived as favourites after winning every game in qualifying. They failed to make it past the first stage in Sweden, that ignominy being a prelude to their monumental collapse in the qualifiers for USA 94. A few months after that goal against Spain, and just before Euro 92, Papin scored what he described as his best goal, against Belgium. It was beautiful.Basile Boli went on an uncharacteristic raid down the right before hanging up a looping cross from the by-line. Papin watched the ball drop as he manoeuvred himself into position just inside the box. With his back to goal, nearly horizontal in mid-air, his left arm reaching for the ground to provide balance and his right leg stretching upwards to meet the ball, he made the sweetest of connections. The ball flew past the keeper. “In my career I scored a lot of nice goals in important matches,” Papin said later. “But that one, on paper, was the most impossible to score.” It encapsulated what made him brilliant. And it came in a friendly, in preparation for a tournament in which France flopped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7d67e789be645cac6a685cd1ebf94afed9fabbb/0_470_5194_3117/master/5194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69f392b3482dc0dd007b8b24f8eb8f3d","title":"newcastle takeover this is a chance to become a seriously big club again","story":"Fans and former players – including Malcolm Macdonald and José Enrique – on the impending Saudi takeover of NewcastleOver the years I’ve always loved the way Newcastle fans traditionally look at things with so much hope and faith but, under Mike Ashley’s ownership, I’ve felt, for the first time really, that a lot of that hope and faith has been lost. Now I believe they will not only return but be properly restored.There are concerns about the regime in Saudi Arabia and things over there are certainly very different to life in Europe, but the Saudis are in partnership with Reuben Brothers and Amanda Staveley so the board will be balanced. And, in the final analysis, business is business.It bodes exceedingly well for supporters as well as everyone working at the club. I’m sure the players will see it as good news. This is a chance for Newcastle to become a seriously big club again.I’ve lost count of the number of “takeovers” I’ve covered! The first came just a year or so after Mike Ashley bought Newcastle and these takeover bids, more recently labelled “fakeovers”, have punctuated his tenure.This deal though is done, as I understand it, and it’s all down to the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test. I expect it to go through, it’s just a case of how quickly.Obviously, the most important story right now is the coronavirus pandemic but this is massive news for Newcastle United.The ethicalhuman rights aspects of a Saudi funded takeover have been on my mind, and I think there’s an awareness on Tyneside of the issues raised by Amnesty International. That said, the overwhelming majority of supporters have welcomed the proposed deal – and the end of the Mike Ashley era. Now, there’s hope, at last. This club has been relegated twice on Mike Ashley’s watch. Fans disillusioned with Ashley’s ownership have been walking away. Ambition and hope will bring them back.If – and it’s still an if – this takeover happens then it will bring back hope to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, in the north-east.For too long, Newcastle has existed for the benefit of one man and that won’t be the case with the new owners. As supporters, what we want to see from them is the club being run in a sustainable, transparent and ambitious manner. We aren’t demanding we win trophies, or win the Champions League, and we appreciate they might not be able to provide us with a “Manchester City effect”, but what we do want is a firm sense that we have our club back and that it’s again going in the right direction.The involvement of Saudi Arabian wealth in the takeover is not a concern right now and ultimately any new owners will be judged like all owners are judged – by how they treat the fans and how they run the football club. Getting those two things right is the most important thing.I have nothing against Mike Ashley – he is a nice guy and when I was at Newcastle he was always good to me. But for sure it is the right time for him to leave the club.Change is needed because Newcastle are not where they should be. They are a top club who should be in the top six and have a top manager. The current manager, Steve Bruce, has done a good job but he is not Rafa Benítez, who was at Liverpool and Real Madrid and had won things. He left because he was not given the money and control he needed to do his job properly, which was a big shame for Newcastle.It looks like the new owners will give the manager – whoever that is – money to spend. That is needed just to make sure Newcastle stay in the Premier League because if you look at clubs like Aston Villa, they are spending £100m just to survive. The new owners need to go beyond that to ensure Newcastle are competing for the top six and even higher.In Spain people ask me: “What is happening with Newcastle?” – they know here that they are a big club who should be doing better. And they are a club with unbelievable fans. I saw that when we got relegated to the Championship and there were 40,000-plus people at every game. Their passion and loyalty is amazing and they deserve more. Hopefully that will be the case now.After 13 years in a loveless marriage with an owner whose disdain for our club and its traditions were all too apparent, we can finally dare to dream again – and dream big.Rafa Benítez’s departure last summer was dispiriting but the hopelessness and despondency that I’ve felt since have been swept away and replaced with a sense of positivity and excitement.All we’ve ever wanted is an owner with the club’s best interests at heart. It looks like we finally have that once more. There’s obviously a worry that access to a bottomless pit of money will dilute the essence of the club, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t thrilled about the prospect of becoming one of the game’s elite players again.I also understand the misgivings regarding sportswashing, but I’m willing to give the Saudi PIF the benefit of the doubt and hope that their involvement in this project hints at a willingness to change and modernise.Many people have decried the potential takeover but, as supporters, we’re allowed to be glad that Mike Ashley is going while recognising that our club’s money will, in part, stem from a regime that’s fallen foul of human rights atrocities.It may be terrible to say, but having boundless sums of money really is the nature of the beast now if you don’t like foreign investment having an influence in football then the elite game is not for you. And our club has been deprived of any sort of investment or ambition for far too long.It’s therefore refreshing to hear that the potential new owners are willing to spend on new players, and will almost certainly break our transfer record more than once doing so. What’s more key is that they will also oversee the regeneration of the city, something that was hugely overlooked – even, arguably, hampered – by Ashley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ff2ab15a77c8558e8f85d97cee3fbda52219076/0_244_4756_2853/master/4756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9b9496916ccdb46d604d20b45ec0459","title":"premier league wants a way out but lack of answers is no surprise","story":"Failure of Friday’s meeting to navigate a way to conclude the football season is a reminder there are a lot of U-turns aheadMany years from now, when films are being made about the present strangeness, it will not go unnoticed that professional football’s collective indecisiveness managed to make the government’s daily press briefings look structured and resolute.Football is not important at the moment one can only agree with Sir Dave Brailsford’s conclusion that sport in general has been taught its place in the overall scheme of things by the events of the last few months. Though what seems likely to be remembered is that when the gravy train hit the buffers the national sport could not agree on anything.Not the right way to go about trimming the enormous wages of players now being mothballed, not a unified approach to the outgoings on non-playing staff in the absence of matches and gate income, not a sensible way to bring a disrupted season to an end and certainly not a timescale for when the dread prospect of fulfilling what remains of the fixture list behind closed doors may actually take place.A Premier League conference that aimed to nail down the last detail ended on Friday without a satisfactory conclusion being reached. The intention is still to see the season completed but drawing up a detailed schedule was just too difficult when “all dates are tentative”. No one was particularly surprised. Everyone’s dates are tentative at the moment not just football’s and one imagines the Premier League representatives knew the futility of their task before they even opened discussions.The very idea of trying to work out a timetable a day after the government had prolonged its indefinitely extendable lockdown policy by another three weeks was optimistic at best but the current stasis is being challenged by other sports in other countries. In addition, because of the size and complexity of the financial obligations the Premier League must find a way to discharge, it was probably felt a wait-and-see policy was not an option, particularly as the likelihood of clubs losing out-of-contract players if the season goes past 30 June is a real and pressing concern.When, inevitably, the only course that could be agreed on was to wait and see it became clearer than ever that football does not have all the answers, or indeed any of the answers. Perhaps we should already have known that given the number of U-turns over the problem of staff furloughing in the past few weeks.Mistakes have been made, there will be more of them, and due to the interconnectivity of football it is hard to imagine there will not be further U-turns or frantic backtracking before everything returns to normal.Domestic leagues want their own programmes completed first, which is understandable because they each comprise 20 or so clubs whose priority is to return to playing each other. Uefa, on the other hand, has a great deal invested in the Champions League, which Europe’s governing body is now saying can be played to a conclusion in late August, traditionally the time of year when the football season gets under way.Somewhere between these conflicting desires that other football tradition, a close season, is being squeezed out of existence. Some smaller countries, such as Belgium, have already indicated a willingness to simply write off this season as spoiled and start one as normal in late summer, though that option is not really open to bigger leagues where the financial implications of promotion and relegation run into many millions of pounds.Yet Belgium’s nuclear option is not without adherents in this country. An informal BBC survey of football fans has revealed that a majority of those who responded favoured the scrapping of the present season over the unappetising alternatives of playing behind closed doors or extending the league through summer.Such a course has simplicity in its favour, if not fairness, though it is doubtful whether many Liverpool fans would support it. There is no doubt Jürgen Klopp’s side are acknowledged champions. Everyone from Pep Guardiola downwards was saying that months ago, though there now seems no way their success can be recognised without compromise. Liverpool do not want to win their first title in 30 years in an empty stadium and neither do they wish to see the trophy awarded to Anfield along with an asterisk after an uncompleted season.The Spanish Football Federation has just unilaterally announced that the present top four will take the Champions League qualifying positions in the event of La Liga’s season being cut short or abandoned. That may appear a reasonable default position in the event of a worst-case scenario, though it happens that everyone in Spain’s top ision has played the same number of games.The same is not true of the Premier League, where Aston Villa, for instance, have a game in hand on most because of their involvement in the Carabao Cup final. Any notion Aston Villa may be relegated without playing that game in hand is a nonstarter, because as it stands at the moment three points would take them out of the bottom three, with Watford the most interested party in any such development.It hardly counts as a shock that football can be complicated, its intricate possibilities and permutations are normally what keep fans going between matches. What has never been fully appreciated before is the level of complication the absence of matches would bring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

There was just something about always being the youngest kid in the room when I was growing up.Grief is unexplainable. My mother has now been dead for 10 years. I only put my grief for her on the shelf when about five years had gone by. I felt as if I’d passed my exams. I had grieved enough, it was time to live again. And it felt like that for the next five years. But this Christmas I got the worst whiplash. It all came back out. I’m doing better now, but it was horrific. Leonard Cohen warned me it would be hard. He told me that, despite his mother having passed away many years previously, in his late 70s she was almost more present than ever.

With advancing age I’ve discovered some odd things about myself in that regard. I’m good with routines, positively formed by them, in fact. It doesn’t matter what the routine is – upend my life and send me back to square one and, so long as you put another routine immediately in place, I’ll get used to it, folding into its shape like a cat in a shoebox. I wasn’t initially delighted by the fact that my expected income for the year evaporated overnight, rendering me quite broke, scared, and a full-time, stay-indoors dad. But it only took a few days for every pattern in my brain to get used to it.I try and give each day specific meaning, to avoid that ‘Christmas week’ sense of fuzzy disconnection from time that would otherwise assert itself. On Mondays, I get a new Spotify playlist to listen to over lunch with the boy. I find out what he likes (mid-90s jungle and drum and bass reissues) and doesn’t like (me pausing these songs to tell him scintillating facts about mid-90s jungle and drum and bass reissues). Tuesday is bin day. Wednesdays, we do lots of video calls. On Thursdays we have a live stream from our local children’s centre where he gets to bop along to children’s hits (studiously ignoring my gaze in case I decide to give him a similarly scintillating lecture on which version of Wheels on the Bus is the real head’s choice).His favourite is bin day as he likes bin lorries above all things. He sits in my arms, silent and open-mouthed, holding the little light-up bin lorry that is his most treasured toy. I spot some children doing the same in an upstairs window across the way, and then realise their wheelie bin has a note pinned on it, thanking the bin men for all they do. I feel a lump in my throat.I don’t want to sound schmaltzy. I mean, you run that risk when you write a column on parenthood, but I always like to preserve a certain ironic distance. Enough so that the reader never gets too worried that I’ll accidentally show genuine emotion. ‘Oh thank God,’ you say, reading the witless pun with which I’ve ended an otherwise heartfelt article. ‘That was a close one.’But as friends lose loved ones, and everything seems uncertain at the moment, I feel that things which hearten should be declared out loud. Leaflets through letterboxes offering to help any vulnerable people in the neighbourhood the man at my back window who does his tai chi every afternoon with a neighbour two gardens over the 8pm Thursday clapping, which grows in length and volume,week on week three bin men seeing a note and passing it around, the glee from an upstairs window at getting a wave and a thank you. And the realisation, clear and bright and powerful, of just how much of a smile you can make out, from a distance, through a bin man’s face mask."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e9fffc6798d7b54542d7989a4e9c5f06d9bc96/0_482_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb5deff8d493cb3d1f095862e9d634c","title":"how tv news hosts get camera ready in lockdown","story":"Broadcasters are falling back on their own skills to stay well-groomed. Unless, of course, it’s Robert PestonAs grooming pages have filled with how-to hacks for eyebrows, root touch-ups and manicures, and celebrities and influencers post tips on social media, the pandemic has inspired a surprising number of beauty trends from buzzcuts and pink hair to nail art.But while many use the hours at home to experiment, one section of the workforce is expected to maintain standards. TV news viewing figures have doubled as the public look to trusted faces to explain the latest Covid-19 developments. That trust comes with expectations.“In a time of crisis, maintaining normality where possible is important,” says fashion historian Amber Butchart. “We expect newsreaders to look professional, and a well-groomed look – for men and women – helps maintain our sense of order. For men, the suit is so ubiquitous that it is practically invisible – in 2014 Australian TV anchor Karl Stefanovic wore the same blue suit for a year to see if anyone noticed. He was highlighting the sexism his female colleagues faced, and he was right to – women in public life continue to be judged for their clothing to a much greater degree than men.”Cathy Newman, presenter of Channel 4 News, says the public have made little comment about her appearance since lockdown started. “I’ve had loads of lovely remarks about the journalism. People stop me in the street and tell me how grateful they are for the stories we’re sharing every night.”Newman’s camera-ready look is still down to the dedicated Channel 4 grooming team. “Lisa, our head of makeup, put together foundation, cover-up, mascara, blusher and every brush under the sun for each presenter. It was incredibly thoughtful. Lisa’s colleague, Amelia, even labelled every brush so I didn’t put eyeshadow on with the foundation brush.”She believes that, whatever the circumstances, presentation does count. “People watch Channel 4 News in their millions on TV and online, so I think it’s important to do them the honour of looking smart. Also, we have an hour of television every night. It’s quite an event, and dressing up for it adds to that sense of occasion. I even wear heels when I’m presenting from home as it psyches me up for the programme.”It remains to be seen whether the conventions of news reporting change as lockdown continues. ITV political editor Robert Peston has already made new rules for his home broadcasts. “I have always been a bit of a mess on camera,” he admits. “I have persuaded myself no one really minds whether I shave or not. And, of course, it is really great that no one can possibly know how long it is since I last showered.”Peston is also immune to video-conferencing paranoia. While most of us cringe at revealing our homes to work colleagues, Peston has cheerfully let the country in. “Though my partner, Charlotte Edwardes, is a bit annoyed that our bare light bulbs, piles of books and dilapidated sofa have been revealed.”Will he take advantage of lockdown to experiment with some of the new beauty trends – a buzzcut or a pink dye job? “Definitely not. At last I have a perfect excuse for the superannuated hippy look.”Maybe the news will look different by the time lockdown lifts after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d86a5b4a97e6227c859d43b52633cc09cea1484/0_130_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bcd90993a5f9a7f1654366c74b73560","title":"from travel to shopping to who pays for home working what you are asking around lockdown","story":"Our consumer columnist’s inbox continues to overflow. Here’s she answers some of your questionsMy flight was cancelled two days before departure and the airline is offering refunds, but as I booked through an agent, I checked the reservation on its website. The flight is still showing as confirmed with no way to claim a refund. I can’t access the online help centre – the phone number just cuts you off. How can I get my money back?Apply directly to the airline because that’s who your contract is with when you buy flights through a third-party booking platform. Airlines are prone to batting passengers back to the agent they booked through, but hold your ground. “The law is clear that the refund must be provided by the airline that was going to operate the flight and not the company that sold the flight,” says Coby Benson of Bott and Co. “If an airline cancels a flight they are obliged to provide a full refund within seven days, or a free replacement flight at a later date (subject to availability). If passengers are not given the option of a refund then they should telephone customer services or put their request in writing, keeping copies.”If the airline is offering refunds, you’re lucky. The travel industry has ripped up the rule book, so far with impunity, in the wake of coronavirus and most carriers are now only offering credit notes to be used for future bookings.My son, who normally does not live with me, has moved back in, to “work from home” because he doesn’t have broadband at his house. Am I entitled to some sort of payment from his employer for providing internet, electricity, heating and facilities? I feel I am supporting an international telecoms company whose office overheads are now minimised. Apparently, staff have been told they will not be compensated because they are not paying travel costs.If the employer can’t, or won’t, pay expenses to its employees you don’t have much hope there, although employers are allowed to pay staff £6 a week tax free to those obliged to work from home during lockdown.However, HMRC has said it will consider claims from employees whose bosses won’t contribute. It’s nothing to get excited about. Your son can claim tax relief on £6 a week, worth £1.20 - £2.40 a week depending on his tax rate. If he tried to claim any more than that, he’d have to provide evidence. The internet is a non starter, though, since you’re paying for it anyway.Should your son wish to return home, he could claim the cost from his employer of taking out a broadband contract if it was specifically for work. Hopefully, he’ll then pass on the riches to you.I bought a coat back in the good old days of last month when high streets were open. It doesn’t sit well on me and I meant to return it, but had to self isolate for 14 days, during which time stores were ordered to close. What happens to the right to return during lockdown?For starters there is no statutory right to return unless the item is faulty or not as described. Refunds for a change-of heart or a mistaken size are offered as goodwill by retailers to keep shoppers coming back.That said, if returns were offered at the time of purchase, the option forms part of your contract with the retailer. Stores are still allowing customers to return unwanted stuff, but most have changed their policies.High street names are mostly requiring customers to wait until stores reopen. John Lewis, for instance, will honour returns for store purchases made on, or after, 18 February 2020 for up to 35 days after lockdown ends, although it will allow a further grace period for customers who have been self isolating.M\u0026ampS has extended its deadline to 90 days until further notice and will accept postal returns, while ShoeZone is allowing its customers 12 months. Shops are also extending the expiry date of gift cards by up to two years.I have a package holiday to Croatia booked with TUI for departure on 27 June. I have paid £400 deposit but the final payment of £3,297.96 is now due. I am apprehensive about making this payment when it seems highly unlikely that this holiday will take place.If I were to pay in full, I would receive a full monetary refund and not just a voucher against any future TUI holiday. But if I fail to settle the final sum, TUI will cancel the holiday and my initial deposit will not be refunded. Telephone contact is proving practically impossible with excessive wait times of hours, not minutes, and it seems there is no way to make electronic contact via the TUI website.Since your holiday has not been cancelled (not yet, anyway) you’d be unwise to withhold payment at this stage. If you failed to pay up, you are likely to be in breach of contract and would indeed risk forfeiting the deposit, or even being sued for loss of revenue, according to Aman Johal, director of Your Lawyers.You’d have no chance of claiming on any travel insurance, either, if you were the one to cancel. TUI, which has only cancelled holidays due before mid May, is, however, offering holidaymakers with departure dates before 30 June to rebook for a later date without charge. The due date for the balance would then move, too.Otherwise, TUI says, holidays after 15 May are currently due to go ahead as normal and the balance must be paid. Following criticism, it has agreed to refund customers whose holidays are cancelled, but some tour operators are insisting on credit notes in the hope the government will amend the rules.Currently, Package Travel Regulations which govern any trip where two or more components are booked together, require a refund to be issued within 14 days if a tour operator cancels a trip. ABTA is lobbying ministers to extend the refund deadline to 31 July and to protect credit notes issued in lieu of cash.Meanwhile, it’s taken matters into its own hands. Until recently ABTA’s website promised any credit notes that are not redeemed by the end of July can be swapped for a refund now it states that refunds can be claimed after they expire. It says: “Refund credit notes should include an expiry date which is based on the travel company’s financial protection arrangements. The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented, evolving situation and ABTA originally gave a 31 July deadline to provide some much needed structure. ABTA will contact any ABTA member if it regards the company’s actions as being in breach of its Code of Conduct,” ABTA says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a1b3f3e54f2f3f94bc4d94fbac2e3432c1e1d4/0_1254_3790_2273/master/3790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bb6dd2cdf2f8eb1d4463b0dca4a7a68","title":"anne marie i just want to make people smile","story":"She’s one of Britain’s most effervescent pop stars. But there’s a lot more to Anne-Marie than her amazing voice. The singer talks about her battles with anxiety and body image – and the unexpected pleasures of lockdown after years on the roadThe pop star Anne-Marie has squirrelled herself away in an alcove, in a corner of a café in south London. It is the middle of February, and she has been working in a studio around the corner, on her second album, and now she’s picking at a veggie breakfast, though it’s three in the afternoon. Her formerly blonde, newly pale-pink hair lights her up like a beacon, but I have arrived a little early, and she looks so quiet and self-contained, so tucked into herself and thoughtful, that I have a strong urge to turn around and leave her to it. I had heard she was a talker, expected the gregarious character that is larger-than-life in her videos, but my first impressions are that perhaps she won’t be much of a talker at all.So, Anne-Marie is a talker, after all. She is three percent Irish, five percent Scottish, a little bit Scandinavian, and as for the rest, “I’m just Essex, basically,” she laughs.Breakfast over, she talks and talks, and she is open and unfiltered. At one point I ask her if she ever feels the need to keep anything back for herself. “I haven’t thought about that,” she says, surprised it might be an option. “I think the reason I’ve been able to even carry on doing this career is because I am so honest and I want people to know who I am. That’s been a great thing for me, rather than, you know, acting like someone else.”At the age of five, Anne-Marie went to a dance school, which sent her to auditions and for a while she had a part in Les Misérables in the West End. Then she switched focus and became a teenage international karate champion before going back to music, taking up songwriting, and ending up as one of Britain’s biggest pop stars. Speak Your Mind was the biggest debut album of 2018.When we meet, she is a month shy of turning 29, and has just released the single Birthday, currently clocking 16m views on YouTube. It’s an arms-in-the-air, get-your-mates-on-the-dancefloor smash about celebration, even if you’re broke, feel sad and thoughts of your ex are hanging around like a pungent aftershave. Her everywoman candour and knock-you-down vocal range have combined into a formula that she has spun into pop gold.She is working away at the new album, version two, with a confidence that had previously eluded her. She has struggled to write songs because of her self-doubt and, even now, when she’s in the studio with people she has written with before, “I almost feel like they don’t believe in me.” She is starting to realise that it’s self-sabotage – all imagined. “It’s actually me in my own brain.” She has suffered with anxiety for a long time, has always been a people-pleaser and admits she longs to be liked. “What I want to do in life is make people happy. Every day I wake up and say, ‘I’m going to make people smile.’” Along the way, she neglected to work out how to please herself.Anne-Marie started working on her own music when she was a teenager. “I didn’t spend time downstairs with my family. It was: in my room, put the CDs on, film myself singing, get better at singing, do that bit again. I think the passion for that overcame the bad bits.”Her first hint of the spotlight arrived in 2014, when Rudimental took her on tour as a vocalist, and she sang with the band for two years. When her own music started to pick up speed, she toured with her friend Ed Sheeran, and did vocals on Clean Bandit’s Rockabye, which became the Christmas No 1 in 2016. When her debut album took off, in 2018, she turned out snappy platinum hit after hit.As she became more successful, her anxiety grew. “It got worse when I became an artist. I was like, ‘Great,’” she says, dryly. “It got overwhelming.” She describes how it manifested as “just, preventing things that were easy. Little things, like going into a room full of people, I wouldn’t be able to do that. I’d have to get people to go in first, so everyone would look at them, then I could go in second.”It was an exhausting period, not just because of her workload. “I just thought I was a weirdo. I didn’t understand myself. Then I found out it was anxiety, and I felt better as soon as I said it, as other people could understand.”She traces it back to having a tough time in her teens. “I think I really started to struggle when I was in Year 8 or 9, and that just came down to me being a prick, to be honest. I became a horrible teenager, the worst kid you can have as a parent.” Even now, she feels the need to keep apologising to her parents for how angry she was, and how much she took it out on them. “My nan passed away when I was 12 and I think that affected me really badly.” They had been close. “She held us all together.”There was another catastrophe, a far more teenage one but a significant one, nonetheless. When she started secondary school, she’d been popular. “And I loved it! I was going out with all the boys, and one would come up to me and say, ‘I want to go out with you,’ and I’d be like, ‘All right, I’ll dump him and go out with you.’ It wasn’t until I was with someone for a long time…”There’s a pause. “Yep. I cheated on him with another boy and that changed everything. From then, everyone hated me.” Her friends stopped speaking to her, overnight. It seems so insignificant now, she admits. “But at the time, it was massive. I never told my family anything about it, because it’s almost embarrassing that people don’t like you. I’d go home and pretend I’d had a good day.”Sometimes girls would talk to her out of school, then at school they would blank her, which left her with long-standing trust issues. “Honestly, until I had hypnotherapy, I had struggled with everyone I’d met, even the people in the label. They’d be like, ‘We’re on your side, we want the best for you.’ I was like: ‘Fuck off, you don’t!’” It sounds as if she was bullied. “Well, do you know what? At one point I guess it was that. But I also think I was a really sensitive person. I find it hard saying that word, ‘bullying’, because in the end, I feel bad for the people I’m calling a bully.”Anne-Marie is close to her family she recently moved back to Essex from London, just to be nearer to them. When she’s away on tour, she calls her mum and dad all the time, a trick she picked up from Ed Sheeran. She asked him for the one crucial piece of advice that he’d give to someone new to the music industry. “He said, ‘Call your mum and dad every day.’” Otherwise, she explains, they only see what everyone else sees. “And you want them to know everything else.” Her dad is a builder and handyman, and her mum a teacher – they’ve been together since they were teenagers, which has given Anne-Marie an idealised view of love.“I thought that was what everyone was like,” she laughs. “I thought the first person I was with, that’s my husband. It made me intense! So the boys were like, ‘Eurgh, get away, we just want to have fun!’” She always wanted to get married, but now she’s older, and has seen a few friends’ relationships break down, she’s not so sure. “It just opened my eyes. Now I’m completely the other side. I’m not bothered.”That disappointment in a romantic ideal comes out again and again in her songs. “I felt like the moment I started to write songs, even if they were really shit, I was being myself, and that’s what I loved about songwriting.” But even when Speak Your Mind got as big as it did, she questioned her abilities. “When I first started writing, I couldn’t write, so I think I never grew out of that. It’s like when I lost weight, I never really grew out of thinking that I was still the chubby Anne-Marie, you know what I mean?”She was 19 when she started feeling “chubby”, she says. “I just ate loads. It wasn’t until a year later and I saw one of my exes at a pub, and he was like: ‘You’re looking healthy’.” He made me look at myself, and then I went the complete opposite direction and had a problem with eating.” Now, she is much more sanguine, at least when it comes to her body. “I just decided, do you know what? I’m just going to see what my body is supposed to be, go to the gym, feel healthy and whatever the shape my body comes out, that’s just what I’m supposed to be.”There was another change, too. After her career had taken off, she started to question why she never felt present, in the moment. “I just felt like I wasn’t actually here,” she says, trying to explain it. She was so unsettled by the sensation that she went online to see whether she might be having a breakdown. There was an interview she did in Australia, at 27, when she was told everything changes when you get to 28. “I’ve always felt I was 20,” she explains. “I felt I was growing up, but not actually growing up. Then when I became 28, I was like, oh shit, I’m 28!” She laughs. “I don’t know if it was what she said that made it go into my brain, or if it actually is a thing that when you’re 28, you change, but I was sitting in my living room one day, and I just cried my eyes out.”At the beginning of April, I give Anne-Marie a call to see how she’s coping with lockdown: “I’m a bit of a germ freak anyway, so it’s heightened everything,” she says, from her bedroom at home. She tells me she’s been on tour or working for seven years, so this is the longest she has been in one place for ages. “I honestly have never been so close to my friends and family at this point. We started on Houseparty and we have a schedule of what we do every day. On Monday, we have bingo. On Tuesday, we have a DJ night, so one of us plays music. Wednesday is quiz night. Thursday is Fitness Thursdays. Friday is Teach-Me Friday. Then Saturday is Quarantine’s Got Talent. So we’ve got a whole schedule.”As well as enjoying having more time to herself, she’s still feeling the benefits of the hypnotherapy she had. “After it, I thought, how the hell had I been making other people happy, when I wasn’t?” she says. She’s still a people-pleaser, but now she feels better about that, too. “I know how good it feels to feel good,” she explains, happy, for now, in the moment.Anne-Marie’s single, Birthday, is out on AsylumMajor Toms"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7a857f0d329a7ce0edf8533b4fa0b5b13d0026/0_226_1600_959/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adafbd39146fd191f7079d70ad27dd45","title":"a year on did change uk change anything","story":"The breakaway party of MPs said they would ‘fix politics’. Now, those at the heart of the rebellion reveal why they failedHard as it is to imagine now, in the early part of last year there was a belief – somewhat desperately expressed – that a new politics might be possible in Britain. One not based on the two “legacy” parties, but that might be open to compromise, a certain fluidity of structure, pragmatism. The idea coalesced around a slogan, “politics is broken”. The question was, how to fix it.One solution was proposed by a breakaway group of MPs, eight from Labour, three from the Conservatives, whose new party – the cumbersomely named Independent Group for Change or Change UK – was accepted by the Electoral Commission 12 months ago this week. Both of the main parties were in disarray, propping up leaders for whom there was no love in parliament. The government had recently suffered the biggest defeat in parliamentary history on the “first meaningful vote” on Theresa May’s doomed Brexit deal. If there was consensus on anything, it was that something had to give.Certain collective pictures became memes. There was the photo opportunity in which all 11 stared up to the heavens as if the sky might be the limit. There was a selfie from an evening in which they gathered self-consciously for a cheeky Nando’s, and Twitter pored over the signifiers (“The difference is the last supper only had one Judas”). And there was the morning when they took their places together in the House of Commons, waving to potential comrades trying to avoid their eyes on either side of the aisle. The caption seemed to want to read: come on in, the water’s lovely!In the last few weeks, I have been speaking to some of those who were at the heart of that rebellion, on and off the record, conversations that have emphasised that cliche of the past seeming like another country. My questions really, boiled down to one: did Change UK change anything?Those who were keen to talk – and several were keener not to reopen that recent wound – dated the beginning of the party to way before last spring. Mike Gapes, 27 years a Labour MP, long-time chair of the Foreign Affairs select committee, said the start for him was back in 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was elected party leader. At the time Gapes was recuperating after two months in hospital with a heart problem. Recovery influenced his desire above all to be true to himself. He agreed with Umunna, who says that by the beginning of 2018, it had long since become “unconscionable to stand on a platform sponsoring someone to become our prime minister who I believed threatened our economic and national security”.Anna Soubry, the Nottinghamshire MP who had become the firebrand voice of the People’s Vote on the Tory side, ascribes her motivation to the lies told in the name of the Vote Leave campaign. “It felt that anyone who refused to go along with a hideous populist agenda was just either ignored or howled down. We still need voices that say: Excuse me, that is not how we do things in this country!”Gavin Shuker, who had represented his home constituency for nine years, dates the genesis to a meeting at the Luton Hoo hotel between himself and Gapes and Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, at the beginning of 2018. “In the 2017 general election,” he says, “many Labour MPs went around telling people on the doorstep that they could vote for us as candidates because there was no real danger of Corbyn getting in. We all knew he was completely unsuitable for office. My feeling was, after the result in 2017, that loophole was closed.”At that meeting at Shuker’s house it was discussed how plan A was still to fight and reclaim the Labour party. It was also agreed that there needed to be “some people thinking what plan B might look like”.Shuker had worked as an organiser in the church prior to entering parliament. He saw his role as “creating the psychological space” in which people might leave the main parties. On this basis he started to have conversations over coffee with 40 or 50 disgruntled Labour MPs. Their responses ranged, he says, from “Thank goodness someone is saying it” to “I agree with everything you’ve said, but I have five years to pay off my mortgage”.Gapes, who had been in the trenches with Neil Kinnock “fighting Trotskyists and tankies who wanted to take over the party” in the days of Militant, now believed the coup had happened. He kept a little diary of his thoughts. “The questions that kept cropping up for me back then were,” he says: “Do you run away? Do you wait for them to come for you? Or do you do something to make a difference?”The answer was made for him after he “vented on a WhatsApp group of friends about antisemitism and some kind person gave that to the Times,” he says. “The fact was, though, that all of us had our own reasons. For me it wasn’t about Brexit. It was antisemitism, Corbyn’s foreign policy, the deplorable comments about the Skripal poisoning.”At the same time that Shuker was sounding out Labour MPs, Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, who had shared an office at Westminster, were having conversations with likely Tory MPs. Brexit had fractured party loyalties. Umunna was not sure at that time how many Tories would join them. “They were two to three years behind Labour in being hijacked by an ugly populism – in their case, of the right – and it was hard to tell when that would happen, to what degree,” he says. Several prominent Tory MPs told him “that they would hop on board” if it looked like Change UK would succeed. “But this was a bit chicken and egg – unless a critical mass of MPs defected from the main parties and joined, it would not succeed.”Soubry was among those to take the leap, partly on the understanding that Umunna would lead the new party. She saw Umunna as a potential prime minister. “Abso-bloody-lutely,” she says. “I genuinely believed that.” She spoke to a number of Tories about the idea of resigning the whip. Several wavered, but the two that eventually agreed were Wollaston and Allen.While the Brexit votes and debates were at loud-hailer volume within and outside Westminster, the commitment of various dissenters was being tested. A series of three clandestine meetings, two-day overnight gatherings, were organised by Shuker at a farm in East Sussex for the “20 or so” Labour MPs who were then seriously considering defection. The first time they all sat down for dinner, “there were people in tears around the table”, Shuker says, as members discussed abandoning a lifelong commitment to the Labour movement.At the time the thinking was not to form a new party, Gapes says, at least not yet. “We thought of it in terms of trimesters,” Shuker recalls. “The first trimester was the one we were in. The second would be as an independent parliamentary group, which would go on as long as possible while we agreed how to do the technicalities. The third would be as a political party, which meant that we would be judged by those standards. In the event, the second and third of those phases collapsed into each other and we obviously failed.”That language of gestation was pointed. As Gapes observes, they had, in Berger’s pregnancy, a very real deadline to make the change – it had to happen before she departed on maternity leave. “That helped to sharpen it,” Shuker says, “and in February a parting in the clouds emerged.”Secrecy was paramount. “I told my mother, a lifelong Labour member, that I was going to make a big announcement on TV, but I didn’t tell her what it was,” Gapes, 67, says. “I didn’t tell my brother, a lifelong trade union activist. Mainly because I didn’t want anyone to talk me out of it.”Those I spoke to can still just about recall the heady optimism of that moment of departure – hundreds of thousands of people signed up online as supporters, donations started flooding in. For Soubry, if there is one thing that changed everything, it was watching Luciana Berger stand up and be counted.“I think that will stand as the iconic moment,” she says. “Luciana was very striking, heavily pregnant, and the sight of her saying she had left the party that had been her life because as a Jewish person she had been hounded out… I think that was the moment that completely destroyed Corbyn’s chances of ever getting elected.”Even at the time of the Nando’s summit, Soubry was adamant in her faith that she was joining a new party led by Umunna. She still believes that things might have been different if the former Streatham MP had taken on the responsibility as promised. “He had the chance on more than one occasion and he chose not to do it,” she says. She never had an explanation.Umunna rejects the idea that he reneged on any promises to lead, saying that the proper time to settle the question of leadership would have been in the autumn of 2019, once the group had a proper structure. Shuker puts that reluctance to take responsibility down to the planned progression of the trimesters. For the new group to get any traction, it needed as many defectors as possible. “People would say, this sounds attractive, but I don’t want to hitch my future to one person’s vanity project,” Shuker says. “Chuka is someone I respect and am still friends with. At one point I had to give him a list of 20 people who were telling me that they would not join a political party led by him, because they thought there should be a more collaborative process. A flatter structure.”That flatter structure quickly came up against the Electoral Commission. The group reckoned they had maybe a one-in-five chance of becoming a real political force, but if there was an early election “they would probably be screwed”. When the party formed it was far from clear that the UK would take part in the European elections planned for May – constitutionally it appeared absurd.When the EU insisted that in the absence of a Brexit deal Britain must take part, however, the group was forced drastically to accelerate its plans. “We had no organisation. No membership. No name,” Gapes recalls. “We tried to register ourselves as the Independent Group and the Electoral Commission would not allow that. So we then became the Independent Group for Change Not ideal. We had a good logo, but that was rejected because it had a hashtag in it. And we imagined we could share the leadership, but the Electoral Commission insisted on us naming one leader.”Heidi Allen, the least experienced of the MPs involved, who had been selected for the safest of Tory seats in South Cambridgeshire in 2015, was installed as a compromise interim leader. “Heidi had some great qualities,” Gapes says, “but she was completely inexperienced as a campaigner.” Having selected a list of 70 candidates from 3,500 applicants in a frenzied Easter weekend of interviews in a London hotel suite, there was immediate confusion about whether to collaborate with other parties. Acting on dubious promises of a united Remainer front, Gapes says, “Heidi started telling people to vote tactically for the Greens or the Lib Dems. And of course the Lib Dems set out to kill us and they ruthlessly did so, as they have done to others in the past.”Umunna suggests that he knew the writing was on the wall as soon as they had to fight the election, which was a “lose-lose” decision. Until then, he says: “We presented no threat, and even traditionally Tory-supporting media were favourable, because they admired the stand we had taken against Corbynism and the hard Brexiters. However, as soon as we registered as a party, the entire establishment – Labour and Tory – turned their fire on us.”New parties might survive many things, Shuker suggests, but they cannot survive ridicule. “The ambition when we launched was to get to the end of the week without becoming a punchline. And we did that pretty well. But you get one shot at forming a political party and if you end up in the calamity that was the European election campaign, where we literally did become the punchline, there was no coming back from that.”The new ideals of consensual politics did not work in the heat of media scrutiny of a campaign. The street fighters in the group who had prevailed in marginal seats over the years came up against those who had a slightly dewy-eyed faith in a “movement” in which things could be done differently. The split was generational as much as ideological. Soubry suggests that “those with deep experience of winning tough elections – Mike, Joan Ryan, Anne Coffey – were elbowed out a bit”.Far from modelling a new politics, the group started to look like they had brought with them the ingrained habits of rats in a sack. “There were a lot of egos,” Shuker says. “At one point I brought in FTSE 100 executive coaching to try to get the group to realise that the biggest threat we faced was holding on to the culture they had left behind. But then you found that some people could not resist going back to the old ways of anonymous briefing to the press and so on.”After the results came through, there was a showdown, Gapes says, between the six who wanted to close the party down – Ummuna, Allen, Berger, Smith, Shuker and Wollaston – and the other five older hands who thought they should battle on. Parliamentary politics after all was as fluid as it had ever been. “But the six decided no. There was no mention in any of that, of anyone joining the Lib Dems. None whatsoever,” Gapes says. (That is not quite how Umunna remembers it, he says, in that he “didn’t rule out” the possibility.) Within weeks, all of those who left, apart from Shuker, joined the Liberal Democrats.Soubry became the reluctant leader of the remaining five. Over the following months, her most significant role in that capacity was to sit in on meetings that tried to resolve the impasse over Brexit. At one point in October, as prime minister Boris Johnson dissolved parliament and tried to keep open the idea of no deal, it seemed likely that an interim government might form. “But the thought of me going back to my group and saying ‘Right guys, the plan is we’re going to rally behind Jeremy Corbyn’ was never really going to happen,” Soubry says.At the general election in December, not one of the original 11 defectors was elected. Does Soubry regret their efforts?“Not for a moment,” she says. “I think truthfully, I’m now 63, I was 62 at the time. I didn’t have a mortgage to pay. But the people with real courage were the ones like Chris Leslie, who gave up a potentially great career in the Labour party, and who did have mortgages to pay.” She still believes that the forces that produced their party will “come back and bite. We can’t have a situation where the prime minister is surrounded by sycophants and there is no credible opposition. If Starmer does prove he is the man who can reform the Labour party, then there is some hope. But if he is unable to do that – and I fear he will not be able to stand up to the Trots – then we really have problems.”What does she make of those who so obviously swallowed their principles – I mention Nicky Morgan, though she doesn’t – for the promise of reward?“There are a few where you think, how do they look themselves in the mirror?” she says. “I assume they say: ‘I did the right thing for my family.’ But if you are in politics that can never be enough in my view…” She plans to write a book about her experiences. “It’s funny,” she says, with a laugh. “After the event, a very senior Labour politician said to me: ‘Why didn’t you just speak to me first and I would have told you what Chuka is like.’”Mike Gapes also went down fighting at the election. Did Change UK change anything?“I think we had a moment when we could have made a difference,” he says. “Even in the autumn if Corbyn had been big enough to say, I will stand aside for an interim prime minister, whether that was Margaret Beckett or Ken Clarke, that could have been a game changer. But a Johnson-against-Corbyn election was always going to be a no-brainer.” At his constituency after the count, Gapes got up and talked about the Labour party’s proud history. “I said I was sad that it was led by a man who was unfit to be prime minister but that I was glad that the British people agreed with me.”Gavin Shuker was among those – along with Chris Leslie – who had more to lose than most from his rebellion. When we spoke, he was in the middle of self-quarantine as his partner had mild symptoms of the virus he was not finding that lockdown was conducive to job-hunting. Still, he believes standing up for his principles was the most rewarding experience of his political life. He has been spending his afternoons, like all of us, watching the briefings about coronavirus. “People might ask me in 30 years ‘what did you achieve in your time in politics?’,” he says. “I’m no fan of this government obviously. But still, I will be able to say I helped prevent Jeremy Corbyn from leading us through a huge national crisis. And to be honest, I’ll take that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a879c107cb499bc8bcd6e50a958106f6274b1935/0_119_3568_2141/master/3568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=62b58ad8f47ad3701697d6956ad29946","title":"international space station crew return to earth","story":"American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space StationThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio’s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of the morning.Morgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.The trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by a recovery crew wearing face masks and rubber gloves, who pulled them out of their landing capsule. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.“Please keep your distance,” one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia’s space agency.Following the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US. A closer airport has been closed to international flights due to the coronavirus. “It’s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we’re truly going back to a different planet,” Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.“We were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren’t.”Isolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.On Thursday, Russian officials reported the first case of coronavirus at Star City, the complex outside Moscow which serves as the control room and training hub for space flights. The director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said on Wednesday that there were currently 30 cases of coronavirus among employees.Even minor illnesses can be disastrous in space, with the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 severely hampered when one of those on board developed a cold soon after blastoff and quickly passed it to the others. For this reason, crews undergo a rigorous quarantine procedure for a month prior to departure.Due to coronavirus, these procedures were made even stricter than usual for the new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.Astronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS. Before blastoff, Cassidy said part of him was pleased to be leaving Earth at the most uncertain time in a generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06462836b9948633a581926ed7a7566181ca7d9e/0_161_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d4538235dd894a3e4b423c084ffcea","title":"mediterranean shipwrecks reveal birth of globalisation in trade","story":"Preserved cargoes of vessels linking eastern cultures with western Europe show ‘the barbarian Orient’ was a trendsetter For almost seven decades archaeologists have searched the eastern Mediterranean in vain for wrecks that sank along antiquity’s mighty shipping lanes.Now, though, a British-led team can reveal a spectacular discovery – a fleet of Hellenistic, Roman, early Islamic and Ottoman wrecks that were lost some two kilometres below the waves of the Levantine Basin between the 3rd century BC and the 19th century.Sean Kingsley, director of the Centre for East-West Maritime Exploration and archaeologist for the Enigma Shipwrecks Project (ESP), told the Observer: “This is truly ground-breaking, one the most incredible discoveries under the Mediterranean.”The ESP’s ambitious underwater exploration used cutting-edge remote and robotic technology to research and record the finds, some of which could rewrite history, according to the experts involved.One of the wrecks is a 17th-century Ottoman merchant ship, described as “an absolute colossus”, which was so big two normal-sized ships could have fitted on its deck. Its vast cargo has hundreds of artefacts from 14 cultures and civilisations, including the earliest Chinese porcelain retrieved from a Mediterranean wreck, painted jugs from Italy and peppercorns from India. ESP say the ship reveals a previously unknown maritime silk and spice route running from China to Persia, the Red Sea and into the eastern Mediterranean.The ship, which is thought to have sunk around 1630, while sailing between Egypt and Istanbul, is a time-capsule that tells the story of the beginning of the globalised world, Kingsley said: “The goods and belongings of the 14 cultures and civilisations discovered, ning on one side of the globe China, India, the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, and to the west North Africa, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, are remarkably cosmopolitan for pre-modern shipping of any era.”He added: “At 43 metres long and with a 1,000-ton burden, it is one of the most spectacular examples of maritime technology and trade in any ocean. Its size is matched by the breadth of its cargoes.”The Chinese porcelain includes 360 decorated cups, dishes and a bottle made in the kilns of Jingdezhen during the reign of Chongzhen, the last Ming emperor that were designed for sipping tea, but the Ottomans adapted them for the craze then spreading across the East – coffee drinking. Hidden deep in the hold were the earliest Ottoman clay tobacco pipes found on land or sea. They were probably illicit because there were severe prohibitions then against tobacco smoking.Kingsley said: “Through tobacco smoking and coffee drinking in Ottoman cafes, the idea of recreation and polite society – hallmarks of modern culture – came to life. Europe may think it invented notions of civility, but the wrecked coffee cups and pots prove the ‘barbarian Orient’ was a trailblazer rather than a backwater. The first London coffeehouse only opened its doors in 1652, a century after the Levant.”Steven Vallery, co-director of Enigma, said: “In the Levantine Basin, the Enigma wrecks lie beyond any country’s territory. All the remains were carefully recorded using a suite of digital photography, HD video, photomosaics and multibeams. For science and underwater exploration, these finds are a giant leap forward.”The last phase of Enigma’s fieldwork was carried out at the end of 2015, with the post-excavation process continuing for years after and remaining unpublicised until now. Some of the recovered artefacts are being held in Cyprus, from where the archaeologists worked. Initial concerns that the site was in Cypriot waters have been disproved, Kingsley said, and the Enigma team now hopes the entire collection will go on permanent exhibition in a major public museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

This commitment needs to be rock solid and consistent so councils can stay focused on leading the local response to the greatest challenge we have faced as a nation for decades.”However, council sources were clear that this may not be the last time the government would need to intervene to stabilise council finances as the costs of social care, personal protective equipment, housing rough sleepers and providing support to vulnerable “shielded” residents continue to mount.Cllr David Williams, the chairman of the County Councils Network, said: “We do not know how long the outbreak will last for, so the financial situation for councils must be kept under review, alongside a commitment to underwrite lost income from council tax.“Coronavirus poses both short- and long-term challenges for our places. It is clear that councils will have a huge role to play in helping our communities and businesses back on to their feet, but we will need to be adequately resourced to do so.”Rob Whiteman, the chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said: “Today’s welcome news is a step in the right direction but more will be needed to ensure councils can maintain services in areas such as adult social care, homelessness and for other vulnerable groups.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb3e043c264864eedd7702249674085d024ff11d/0_134_4011_2407/master/4011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be54375d93877af4ff75b182811bc72f","title":"duty or score settling rights and wrongs of corona shaming","story":"Police are receiving thousands of reports a day of lockdown rules being broken as ‘Covidiots’ enters public lexicon Melissa has reported her neighbours to the police three times since lockdown began. There are a dozen flats in her block and she lives with her seven-year-old son, who she says has asthma-like symptoms. She is furious about “the inconsiderate, selfish behaviour” of residents using communal hallways yet still not complying with lockdown rules.“My neighbour never seemed to do any exercise before and now he’s training for the Olympics, out two or three times a day.”Melissa suspects another neighbour has had “different lovers round” in the evening and has been venting to her friends on their CoronaHell WhatsApp group. She says she is proud to be following the rules and feels it’s right to shame those who don’t. “We all have to protect one another,” she says. “We can only stay safe together if we do the right thing inidually.” She does not want to give her full name.Police have been inundated with thousands of daily reports of people allegedly breaching coronavirus rules, prompting the police’s professional standards body to ask the public to curb “deliberate false reporting” and the spread of “misinformation” to target nuisance neighbours or to settle long-running feuds. To date, 3,203 fixed penalty notices have been issued by police, ranging from 380 in Lancashire down to five in Warwickshire. As Britain enters week five of lockdown, “corona-shaming” has ided debate: what compels a person to publicly corona-shame their neighbour? A moral public duty or an opportunity to vent the mounting frustrations of cabin fever?For Paul Goodwin, who set up the Facebook group Covidiots UK two weeks ago, the answer is obvious: “We have to support the NHS. That’s the reason. The quicker we bring this in line and do what we’re supposed to do, the quicker we return to normalcy.”According to Google Trends, the term Covidiots – defined by Urban Dictionary as “someone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety” – first appeared online on 15 March.Goodwin lives in a village in Warwickshire with his wife, who used to be a paramedic. He set up the group for “a couple of dozen friends”, many of them who work in healthcare, “to highlight some of the unbelievable behaviour of people”. There are now almost 200 members. “We had seen so many people here who feel the rules don’t apply to them. They were blatantly setting up barbecues in local parks, having house parties, sunbathing and so on a few weeks ago. More people seem to be complying now.”On Twitter, a photo of a sign pasted on a window by a neighbour to shame “Ann” who “keeps on having a friend round” sparked a row over snitching and sanctimony. Later in the week, a videoclip of crowds on Westminster Bridge breaking social distancing guidelines – ironically, while clapping for the NHS – horrified social media users and went viral.In Norfolk, an NHS nurse went on Facebook to post a photo of a note left on her car. In a spectacular misfire, the note from a neighbour read: “I have been watching you travel everyday … this is clearly unessential travel! You are part of the problem! … You have been reported!”Over Easter weekend, author and Times columnist Caitlin Moran was publicly shamed and branded a hypocrite on Twitter for allegedly spending Friday afternoon in a friend’s garden while writing a piece for the Saturday paper headlined “Lockdown is easy!”. Neither the Times nor Moran commented on the matter. The incident was preceded by cabinet minister Robert Jenrick, who made media appearances urging the public to stay home, while flouting rules to visit his own parents.Jon Ronson, author and consultant on an upcoming HBO documentary about shame, with Monica Lewinsky, said he was unsurprised about how quickly “a Stasi-like” narrative had emerged.“I can maybe, maybe understand the impulse to shop your neighbour – I’ve been quarantining for weeks longer than most and can get annoyed at people flouting the rules when I’m working so hard to stick to them. But it’s difficult, because you will always find transgressions slap bang in the middle of a grey area,” he said. “So what are the rules? I quite like the approach of shaming the behaviour, not the inidual.”Ronson’s 2015 book, So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed, explored the twisted downsides to lecture, cancel, and bully people online. “We’ve seen time and time again when shaming becomes too rampant, terrible things happen. Not least to huge amounts of innocent people.”Over on the website Mumsnet, one user was considering vilifying her husband in the village Facebook group for “going out at least once a day in his twatty sportscar” while another thread on the internet forum was dedicated to analysing “why people are covidiots”.Frustration is evidently running high. “The entitled think they are somehow special and justify their actions to themselves,” wrote lubeybooby. Another poster, Oldhaggard, blamed “good ol’ fashioned selfishness … We’re used to our wants being addressed as needs most of the time, and I think people are struggling to see a difference between them.”“We should set positive norms about behaviour. Rather than starting from a presumption of an ill-will, one should start from the presumption that people are good: trust your neighbour and ask how you can help them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4144efbb38e49955a30ba905ea919406298eec2a/160_22_2076_1247/master/2076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3134674dca8b01d6822ae174c659e4aa","title":"last night i was james bond the vivid world of lockdown dreams","story":"People are ‘living’ a richer and more detailed life in their sleep during the Covid-19 crisis, a research group has foundOne person tried to stock up on broken biscuits at the supermarket with a couple of children’s TV presenters, only to be pursued by an angry mob. Another accidentally tore up all of the artist Jasper Johns’s work, before being chased out of the exhibition by an enraged 80s dance troupe. A third climbed into a plane to escape a collapsing building, realised there was no pilot – and decided he could just hide in the toilet.These are just a few of the vivid dreams people have been having during lockdown, according to a research project by an independent group of postgraduate psychoanalysis students in London. The group, Lockdown Dreams, is asking people to fill in an online survey about the dreams they are having at the moment as part of a project to “collect” dreams and analyse how the Covid-19 crisis is being experienced “unconsciously”.So far, the most common trend people are reporting is richer and more detailed dreams than usual – a sharp contrast to the monotony of daytime lockdown. “Everyone’s quite shocked by the fact that they’re having incredibly vivid dreams. That’s so interesting because our material waking lives have become, in a way, more dull,” said Jake Roberts, a spokesperson for the group.“But this is being reflected in a more vivid dreaming life. Our minds are obviously reaching out to try and make something from the little stimuli we’re receiving being locked down, and bringing up things we’ve completely forgotten about.”Respondents are also recalling their dreams more often, he said: “It seems to be a universal thing, that people are remembering their dreams more than they normally would.” This may be a consequence of changes to routines and sleep patterns – and with no commute or school run to do, there are fewer reasons to spend the mornings rushing about. “We generally don’t think about how we’re thinking and feeling, but perhaps, at the moment, we’re being more reflective,” said Roberts.With that extra reflection has come a greater-than-usual ability to recall the detail of dreams, he added. “People are remembering very specific aspects of the dreams, like smells, emotions or places. And they are able to describe buildings and scenery, which is something we are not usually able to do.” In other words, he added, people are “living” in their dreams. “They’re experiencing their dreaming world as they would their waking world.”Dr Nick Blackburn, a psychoanalytic psychotherapist, says his patients are also reporting more vivid dreams since the lockdown began and remembering them more often. Breaking the rules and being punished by others is a recurrent theme. “One patient said, ‘I dreamt I was caught having sex in a cubicle at my favourite restaurant. They gave me a lifetime ban and I was so distraught I wouldn’t get to eat there again.’”These people may be suppressing irrational thoughts that the lockdown is a punishment for a mistake they made or something bad they did. “We all think the world revolves around us. It’s like when a child sees something traumatic – there’s a tendency to think: it’s my fault in some way,” said Blackburn.Several of his patients have dreamed about empty shelves in supermarkets and being unable to get their bodies or their houses clean. Others have had anxiety dreams about blocked toilets and drains. “I think we’re all feeling a bit overwhelmed,” Blackburn said.At night, he thinks, the unconscious mind is having to do more work under lockdown: “A dream can offer a possibility of putting into words something that the dreamer might want to put into words. Either they’ll wake up, and the dream will have done its work... or they will wake feeling disturbed. And then I’d invite them to be curious about what it is that has disturbed them.”Natasha Crowe, a psychotherapist, recently set up connected-together, a free telephone and online support service to help people who need someone to talk to during the pandemic. She says that dreams have come up a lot in discussions with clients. “They’ve had really vivid, weird dreams about trying to run away and trying to escape. Which makes perfect sense during the lockdown,” she said.Crowe thinks people are feeling a lot of fear at the moment – and that can manifest itself in many different ways. For example, she says, people are experiencing dreams that are similar to thrilling TV shows. “It’s like the dream is Killing Eve, and you’re in it,” she said.Roberts’s group has also noticed that a lot of the dreams being reported have a “filmic” quality. “I feel like people are watching a lot of Netflix. The characters that appear are often actors or celebrities and there’s a sense in the dream of being the protagonist in their own film,” he said.Narratives that involve secret missions and spying are popular. “There have been quite a few that have been just like a James Bond film. They get the girl and they defeat the bad guy – except the bad guy is someone strange like Arnold Schwarzenegger.”The good news for anyone who is already tired of having such vivid dreams is that the phenomenon may not last. “In general, humans have an amazing capacity to become accustomed to any situation,” Roberts says. “So at least tentatively, we could say that this incredibly vivid dreaming might start to wane after a while as we get used to this situation.”The group hopes that if people share their experiences, they will feel less alone with their anxieties. “I have submitted a few dreams of my own to the survey,” says Roberts. “And I know it has helped me, being able to write my dream down and say how I felt about it. The act of remembering a dream is itself a way of cognising something. It’s a way of processing what’s going on that many people wouldn’t usually have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b335c680f2812f33e879c0ca8ddbf8e4fa0add08/0_89_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ebf061aef9af4d079feca55cbbcdd16","title":"michael jordan documentary espn the last dance nba","story":"A superb new ESPN documentary series reminds us that everything in the NBA legend’s playing career was bent towards a single goal: winningHave we never seen Michael Jordan like this before, or is it simply that we forgot? Anyone who lived through the Chicago Bulls’ domination of the NBA during the 1990s – even, like me, as a kid – can probably still recall the broad outlines of Jordan’s talent, the qualities that made him such an exceptional athlete: the elasticity the hang time the spectacular dunks, ludicrous switch-hands layups, and clutch buzzer-beaters the raw power. Jordan reigned at “the end of history”, in that curious decade between the fall of the Berlin Wall and 911, and for all his ability with a ball in his hand he’s always seemed a little remote, a little above it all. He was the perfect athlete, in a sense, for the decade that fancied itself post-political. In an era that thought it had figured it all out, Jordan was the player who actually had.And yet. As The Last Dance, the 10-part documentary whose first episodes premiere on ESPN in the US on Sunday (with the worldwide releases for each on Netflix the following day), shows, he was so much more. Yes, Jordan was gloriously, unironically macho. Yes, his body worked like a Swiss army knife, limbs cutting through the air in all directions at one moment then snapping back into a streamlined cylinder the next. Yes, he was capable of outrageous things on the court. But he was also a bully, a wrecking ball, the owner of a volcanic will to win, a man of almost unbearable intensity. However much joy Jordan gave to millions throughout his career, and will surely give to millions more with the release of this banquet of a documentary, it’s hard to escape the feeling that being him – occupying that body, harnessing that talent, channelling that unrelenting drive to be the best – must have been incredibly hard. The Last Dance is nominally about Jordan’s last season with the Bulls, but flashbacks give us the full, luxurious history of His Airness, and what we’re really offered by the end of it all is a study in sympathy. The man who emerges from these 10 hours of pure 90s nostalgia is heroic, preposterous, demanding, difficult, and sometimes outright tyrannical - and somehow only even more appealing for all his flaws. He cared about one thing, and one thing only: winning. Once you understand the singularity of Jordan’s focus, everything else about him makes sense.The Last Dance takes its title from the name of the dossier that Bulls coach Phil Jackson, in a typically canny bit of marketing, handed to every player ahead of the 1997-98 season. Jordan had progressed from a promising but coltish No 3 pick in the 1984 draft to the NBA’s first authentic international superstar his rise paralleled, or rather propelled, the global rise of the league. But by 1997, five titles to the good, it had become clear that Jordan’s Bulls had only one season left in them. Longtime general manager Jerry Krause had signaled that Chicago’s team of champions would be broken up at the conclusion of the season. Jackson, the man who convinced Jordan, in the late 1980s, to set his ego aside and trust in the transformational beauty of the triangle offense, was also to be shown the door. We all know how the story ends – Jordan led the Bulls to a second three-peat, before riding off into the sunset – but what happens along the way is all the pleasure of this spectacle. A TV crew followed the Bulls around for the duration of the season, and the footage they recorded – footage that has never been aired until now – forms the backbone of The Last Dance. We see Jordan coping with Scottie Pippen’s back injury – the Bulls lieutenant ended up being out of action for the first 35 games of the season – and the ongoing discord between Pippen and management. We see him trying to keep the playing group together during the periodic disappearances and brain fades of an agreeably demented Dennis Rodman. We see him bickering with Steve Kerr, of all people.Most of all, though, we see Michael Jordan angry. If there’s one theme that emerges most emphatically from The Last Dance it’s the sheer force of Jordan’s personality, the rage that drove him on. Repeatedly throughout his career, Jordan used slights against his greatness as motivation to obliterate all before him. He decided to destroy the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1992 finals because he didn’t like comparisons suggesting he and Clyde Drexler were on the same level. He and Pippen resolved to gang up on Toni Kukoc in the first game the Dream Team played against Croatia at the 1992 Olympics because Krause, a regular punching bag, thought Kukoc was a good player who would improve the Bulls roster. He punched Kerr in the face in preseason ahead of the 1995-96 campaign, ahead of his first season back after 18 months away playing baseball, because “we were shit when I got back” and a point needed to be made.To watch Jordan reflect on these incidents now, ensconced in the armchair of his spacious, beachy home, settled into a thick middle age, cocktail tumbler by his side, chuckling fondly as the filmmakers hand him a tablet and he watches the footage, say, of Gary Payton reflecting on his efforts to stop Jordan in the 1996 finals, it can all seem a little ridiculous that he ever took things so seriously.But if The Last Dance proves that Jordan was not exactly popular with his teammates, it also reminds us how magnetic his personality was, how charismatic and funny he could be, of the cult that quickly grew up around him. Repeatedly we see him goofing around in practice, bantering back and forth with the press, or on the Bulls’ private jet, cigar in mouth (the sheer amount of tobacco smoked during The Last Dance would be enough to give most people lung cancer), gently teasing his entourage. The respect of his rivals is unmistakable. In the summer of 1995, as he prepared for his first full season back post-retirement, Jordan was contracted to shoot Space Jam. He asked Warner Brothers to build him a facility to practice in during the shoot, and the studio duly complied by creating the Jordan Dome, a custom-built indoor full-size basketball court and training gym. From 7am to 7pm, Jordan shot the film. Then, for three hours after shooting wrapped each night, he played pick-up games with a roster of the NBA’s best, all of whom traveled to LA to be close to him: Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller, Dennis Rodman. “Those were the best games,” Miller recalls with boyish wonder.The series deals sensitively with the murder of Jordan’s father and the other, darker chapters of his career: his gambling habit and lack of engagement in popular politics. Jordan’s apolitical character – “Republicans buy sneakers too,” he reportedly said after refusing to endorse North Carolina Democrat Harvey Gantt in his 1990 Senate race against the notorious racist Jesse Helms – has often been cited against him in the interminable debate over whether he or LeBron James deserves the title of greatest basketballer ever. Where LeBron is fully committed to his role as a public figure and unafraid to take polarizing stances on political issues, Jordan mostly shied away from anything that would alienate segments of his enormous, bipartisan fanbase. The Last Dance does not avoid pressing Jordan on these issues, though his answers are mostly unsatisfying he claims he could not endorse Gantt because he “didn’t know the guy”.It’s clear that his priorities lay elsewhere: in making money, gambling (how strange that era’s moral panic over Jordan’s love of a bet appears today), and above all, winning. That focus on making money and doing all the talking on the court – which, on the evidence here, his teammates evidently shared – made Jordan the archetype of the modern athlete. Jordan was not so much an inidual as an industry, and he set the template for the generations of athletic gods that followed: the endorsements, the clothing lines, the cultural tie-ins and carefully managed media spots. But the curation of his image was designed, very obviously to Jordan’s mind, in pursuit of a single objective: being the best. Winning was the real aim, and everything else had to serve it. If Jordan did have any politics, any consciousness of racial or economic injustice, it was sublimated into the overwhelming fury that consumed him the moment he stepped on the court.The most moving scenes in The Last Dance show Jordan in the moments after clinching his first and fourth titles. In 1991 we see him in the dressing room next to his dad, face pressed to the Larry O’Brien trophy, crying a torrent of tears, and for a second we’re there with him, living the extraordinary catharsis of that first ring. In 1996, his first title back after the 18-month hiatus in baseball, he’s back in the dressing room, clutching a ball, face down on the floor, his body convulsing as the tears flow untrammeled once again. These are the only moments in the documentary where we see 90s-era Jordan in any mode other than those of the training ground shit-talker, the on-court destroyer, the cigar-chomping GOAT the only time he’s not braggadocio on legs. It’s fitting that the athlete perhaps best known in popular culture today for the “crying Jordan” meme should be reintroduced to us in this way. Myths and misperceptions swirled around Jordan throughout his career: that he was selfish, wasn’t a team player, only cared about getting rich. To see the footage of him after those 1991 and 1996 titles, that Ferrari of a body heaving with uncontrollable tears, possessed by the release of victory, is to understand who Michael Jordan really was: as pure a competitive animal as professional sport has ever seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec753d37a0bede98b5228bfa4654fdc62712d035/0_162_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8411f3af48f530ff520b8f200d99ee89","title":"amazon quarterly results 10000 dollars a second","story":"Amazon will tell the world this week just how much money it has made from the “unprecedented demand shift” to its site from millions of people under lockdown conditions around the world.The retailer, which is run by the world’s richest man, Jeff Bezos, will release its sales and profit figures for the first three months of the year (including the first few weeks of the lockdown in the UK and much of Europe and the US) on Thursday.Sales at Amazon had already been increasing, but analysts at Bank of America say the lockdown has fuelled an “unprecedented demand shift” to online sellers.While most businesses have been hit hard by the impact of the pandemic and the looming recession, shares in Amazon have risen to a record high as hundreds of millions of people stuck indoors turn to the delivery giant to keep them fed and entertained.Josh Brown, chief executive of Ritholtz Wealth Management, said: “Amazon became a utility in this crisis – defensive, reliable, indispensable.”Analysts at the US investment bank Cowen likened the impact of the lockdown to the Black Friday shopping frenzy in November, or Amazon’s own Prime Day sale in July. “Amazon has seen an ‘enormous increase in demand’ as shoppers are forced to stay home, essentially creating an extended Prime DayBlack Friday type of situation,” they wrote.At these prices the business is valued at $1.2tn, making it the third biggest US company after Microsoft ($1.35tn) and Apple ($1.25tn).Bezos, who has donated $100m (£80m) to the food bank charity Feeding America, has told staff he is concentrating on developing testing that should help Amazon staff keep working. In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, Bezos said Amazon had assembled a team of scientists and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its own testing laboratory soon.“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,” he said.Amazon is also rapidly hiring staff to keep up with demand from shoppers. The company said on Monday it was hiring an extra 75,000 staff to help it to process the increase in orders. Those new recruits come on top of 100,000 taken on already since the coronavirus crisis hit western economies last month. The additional workers will take Amazon’s global workforce to nearly 1 million.Joshua Warner, an analyst at the London-based online trading firm IG Index, said: “Amazon shines from all angles during the coronavirus crisis. Ultimately, Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis, providing key services including food, entertainment and shopping at a time when consumers have fewer retailers to choose from.“Amazon stock has rocketed to a new record high,” he added. “Of all the firms that might stand to benefit, Amazon is a clear winner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb60ba8def914b60ebbab9ff4b7a8578a2f7b6d/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2286726dc44089a1d2f06cfec64d4a1","title":"is the cruise industry finally out of its depth","story":"Accidents, pollution, exploitation… cruise firms were in murky waters even before Covid-19“We’ve been asked – and we’ve asked ourselves – why Covid-19 seems to be impacting Princess so heavily.” Thus spoke Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, in a video posted on social media in mid-March. She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: “We don’t really know.” Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the “erse mix of people onboard our ships” and is “being magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world”. She implores her “guests” with a “simple request”: “We ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination … as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that ide us.”Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their Diamond Princess, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia. The Grand Princess was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March. Something similar happened to the Coral Princess in early April, off the coast of Florida. And this to say nothing of the Caribbean Princess, which has twice this year had to end cruises early, due to hundreds falling ill from a quite different infection, the vomiting bug norovirus.But not everyone is yet convinced that all of Princess’s misadventures are purely bad luck. New South Wales police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, to see whether its owners were “transparent in contextualising the true patient and crew health conditions relevant to Covid-19”. They are suspected of lying, in other words, about conditions on the ship. Legal actions have sprung up from unhappy “guests” of the Grand Princess, their trips-of-a-lifetime wrecked by allegedly inadequate screening procedures. Professor Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese expert on infectious diseases who went on to the Diamond Princess, described the onboard response to the virus as “completely chaotic”.A rather obvious question is whether Covid-19 is simply an act of God, or whether its impact on their passengers, crew and host ports has been magnified by the practices of cruise companies. They vigorously push back against this suggestion: a spokesman for Carnival tells me that “the cruise industry took action before most other industries on land took actions”, that “cruise ships are social gathering places, but no less risky than any other social gathering venue”, and asks “when was the last time you were asked to fill out a health record before being allowed to enter a concert?” In the case of the Diamond Princess, say Princess Cruises, they were following instructions from the Japanese health authorities.Trust on this question, on the other hand, is not improved by reports that some cruise-line salespeople (not Carnival), in mid-March, were being instructed to talk punters out of their concerns about Covid-19, for example claiming that the coronavirus could not survive in tropical climates and that therefore it was a good time to visit the Caribbean. Trust is further weakened by the cruise industry’s long history of environmental and safety lapses, and their special skill at minimising the consequences to themselves.A bigger question is whether the virus will dent, deflect or alter what has been a phenomenon of our times, the many-times multiplication of ship sizes, of passenger numbers and of profits, generated by an industry that manufactures its own version of reality, then shapes the places that its ships visit in the image of that reality. Cruises, as Wallace put it, serve that “part of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately wants”. Cruises are founded on fantasy, which means the removal from view of anything irksome or demanding of difficult choices.All of which might be good, clean fun, if the growth of cruises weren’t accompanied by reports of pollution spills, outbreaks of disease, accidents, mistreatment of workers and sexual assaults and other crimes. If these reports don’t change much over the decades it is because the cruise lines don’t change much, either. They can spend lavishly on lobbying and campaign contributions to friendly politicians, and hire lawyers to see off the lawsuits when things go wrong. Their business being offshore, cruise lines are free to choose the countries where they register their ships and incorporate their business, which means places like Panama, the Bahamas or Bermuda, where they can pay low taxes and get an easy ride on labour rights, and on health, safety and environmental regulations.“They only change when they have to,” says Ross Klein, a sociology professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland, whose website cruisejunkie chronicles the mishaps of the cruise business. And nobody much makes them change. There is a trade body, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which promotes the business and in theory upholds standards. “They will tell you that they have mandatory regulations and that they meet or exceed international regulations,” says Klein. “Well, we asked CLIA’s senior vice-president what happens when a company violates these regulations: nothing. Perhaps a stern talking-to, but otherwise nothing.”Cruise companies’ aversion to responsibility can be seen in a legendary court filing following the “poop cruise” of 2013, in which failing generators on the Carnival Triumph caused a backup of raw sewage into the passenger areas. Carnivals’ lawyers, CNN reported, said that the “ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.” Equally striking was the legal outcome to the 2012 wreck of the Costa Concordia, when the party atmosphere of cruises mixed fatally with questions of navigation: the owner Costa Crociere (another part of the Carnival empire), with the help of a plea bargain and €1m fine, and despite clear failings on its part, was freed of any management and operational responsibility.Or you could take another incident that befell the ever unfortunate Princess Cruise lines, when the Caribbean Princess was found to have been dumping oily waste in the sea off southern England. In 2017 a Florida court found that the Caribbean and four more Princesses had been engaging in illegal practices, issued a record fine of $40m and put the company on probation for five years. President Jan Swartz performed a hand-wring to camera, as she has over Covid-19, to say that “we are very sorry for the actions of our employees” and that “the marine environment is incredibly important to us”.Princess ships then continued to pollute, for example by depositing faecal coliform in Alaskan waters. In 2019 they were fined a further $20m. If a combined penalty of $60m sounds like a lot, it is as Klein points out a small portion of the $3bn or so annual profits of Princess’s owner, Carnival. “To them, that’s just a cost of doing business,” he says.And you have Venice, the actual city rather than the theme versions, where for years what are effectively multistorey hotels have been looming over its historic architecture, their mighty parps competing with church bells, their diesel smoke polluting the air, damaging the ecology of the lagoon and, say protesters, the foundations of buildings with the water they displace, and discharging thousands-strong fluxes of tourists on highly managed six-hour trinket-and-selfie binges in the city. Then, last summer, the 65,000-ton MSC Opera, its engine failing, crunched into a moored tourist boat like a boot on to a bug. There were miraculously no deaths, but the crash made the cruise industry’s previous assurances of safety sound hollow.Despite excited reports last year that large ships would be banned from the city, nothing definite has been decided. At most, larger ships will be displaced to other ports in the Venetian lagoon, which would involve new environmental impacts. Among the complications in finding a solution is the fact that Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other big cruise companies are shareholders of the company that owns Venice’s maritime port.The issue is not just about the filth and damage that ships emit into Venetian air and water, but of the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate between passengers and their host city. Eleonora Sovrani, of the local campaign group We Are Here Venice, argues that the cruises’ “guests” – on their brief visits, following itineraries proposed by the ships, visiting outlets suggested by them – never leave the cruise “bubble”. The city is forced “to change its aspect to answer expectations of the cruise companies,” she says, in what is a form of “cultural appropriation”.What goes for Venice now goes for many other places in the world. In pre-virus Sydney, successive ships would be moored near the considerably smaller Opera House, almost permanently blocking certain views, while others would be waiting their turn out in the bay. Cruises have shown increasing enthusiasm for invading the Arctic and Antarctic, their paths eased by the melting of globally warmed ice, with many thousands of gawpers descending on tiny Inuit settlements. In New Zealand, Princess Cruises – hello, my old friend – were obliged to apologise for their crassness, after some non-Maori men with DIY skirts and scribbles on their face were hired to perform an am-dram version of a traditional Maori welcome to passengers on the Golden Princess.To all these points the cruise industry naturally has its responses. They make claims about health, safety and the environment, which for the reasons given by Ross Klein should be treated sceptically. They say, for example, that norovirus is rare on cruise ships, using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC, however, is only able to obtain information on ships that visit US ports, so can’t give global statistics, which limits the usefulness of any conclusions that might be drawn.Cruise companies argue that they create employment, which they do, for everyone from officers to crew to waiters to beauticians and standup comedians. They say that they bring revenue to their host cities, which they also do, though Klein and others dispute the level of benefits claimed by the companiesSince cruise passengers sleep on their ships and also tend to eat and drink on them, their benefit to local hotels, restaurants and bars is limited. Those shore-based traders to whom the ships direct their passengers generally have to pay a handsome cut for the privilege. Cruise lines also acquire interests in terminals and retail outlets, such that even more income is whisked away from their host ports. Just supposing that the tourist dollar were not so relentlessly hoovered up by cruises, might it not be generating other, maybe more rewarding jobs in businesses that don’t have the same breaks on taxes and regulations?The cruise companies’ strongest argument is that their customers love their product. Which, mostly, they do. Even some who endured the Covid-cursed cruises say they will go back to the ships when they can. And to sail the seas and see the world is, indeed, a great thing. But perhaps cruise passengers would have an even better time if there weren’t a nagging feeling that the management might not be totally on top of novel or familiar viruses on their ship, or that the excretions and eructations of their big white ships are trashing the beauties they are paying to see.And claims of passenger satisfaction and revenue-generation should not invalidate the wishes of host cities for basic respect or the argument that the quality of interaction between tourists and locals is as important as the quantity. As Sovrani puts it, cruises should adapt to cities, not the other way round. Again, cruise passengers might have a better time if they were not thrust into the cogs of an engine of exploitation.Much, of course, depends on what happens in the world to come after the virus, which not so long ago was barely a blip on the radar. Forbes magazine, on January 20, could see only “smooth sailing into the 2020s”. In February CNN quoted various experts saying it was still OK to cruise. The Cruise Dialogue conference met in Cartagena, Colombia, also in February, asking its industry delegates and speakers “how best to accommodate the seemingly unstoppable growth of cruise activities?” Almost no one mentioned the virus.The Zaandam set off on its disastrous voyage on 7 March (when, as Klein points out, a number of ships had already been turned away from ports). On the previous day there was the first talk of federal help for the cruise industry, an idea that seemed open to doubt, given the cruise companies’ exotic registrations: if they don’t pay US taxes, how could they receive US subsidies? Even President Trump, who notwithstanding those pesky Panamanian and Bahamian flags called cruises “a great US business”, acknowledged the problem, before saying that “we’re going to try and work something out”. Which, not least because Carnival’s chairman Micky Arison is a friend and backer of Trump, the company having been a sponsor of The Apprentice, you can be sure he will try very hard to do.“The infantile part of me,” wrote David Foster Wallace, “is by its very nature insatiable.” However much gratification and pampering it will receive, it “will simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out at its homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction.” He could as well have been describing the cruise business as its customer experience. Now, though, it is time for cruises to grow up: if the industry has been based on the outsourcing of reality, reality has come back to bite it. A CLIA spokeswoman tells me that they “aim to do our part to protect the sanctity of the destinations we visit so that they can remain a vibrant place to live and visit for generations to come”. Let’s hope so: if it wants public money and public trust, the cruise business should accept the public responsibilities it has been so good at shirking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0fca2674d6d927929b068326a4a6269151e8eed/0_326_5181_3110/master/5181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=334b3e65d22a95a2daa602abe468a740","title":"florida beaches hundreds coronavirus","story":"Some beaches open with distancing restrictions after governor OKs openings ‘in a safe way’Hundreds of people in Florida reportedly flocked to several beaches as they reopened for “essential activities” after being closed because of the coronavirus outbreak, despite the state’s death toll climbing to 726.When police removed barriers from one of these beaches on Friday, crowds cheered, CNN reported.The Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who was widely criticized for moving slowly to contain the outbreak, permitted some reopenings.DeSantis said some cities should feel free to reopen beaches and parks if doing so could be done safely, and with social-distancing restrictions. “Do it in a good way,” DeSantis told reporters, saying people needed fresh air. “Do it in a safe way.”The areas that reopened were in north Florida, including stretches of sand in Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach, local TV reported.The “essential activities” permitted at Jacksonville Beach include “recreational activities consistent with social distancing guidelines such as walking, biking, hiking, fishing, running, swimming, taking care of pets and surfing”.“This beach will be open from 6am to 11am, and from 5pm to 8pm each evening,” local station WJAX said.Sunbathing is not permitted. Other restrictions include prohibitions on towels and blankets, coolers and grills, and beach chairs, as well as “lingering on the beach without moving”, and gatherings exceeding 10 people.“Folks, this could be the beginning of the pathway back to normal life, but please respect and follow these limitations,” said the Jacksonville mayor, Lenny Curry. “We’ll get back to life as we know it but we must be patient.”“I honestly thought it was phenomenal,” Jacksonville resident Amanda Campos told First Coast News. “It gives people fresh air. They can go for a walk. It’s nothing crazy. We’re not saying the clubs are opening and it’s not a closed space.”Deborah Melvin, a Jacksonville resident who said she had lost family and friends to Covid-19 said: “This is really a crazy bad idea.”“I’m afraid. I’m afraid for myself. I’m afraid for my family. Everybody should use their common sense,” she added.DeSantis issued a statewide stay-at-home order on 1 April, much later than many states and one month after Florida marked its first confirmed Covid-19 cases. He drew significant criticism for not closing beaches during the earlier college spring break, which draws hundreds of thousands to the state annually, when beaches were packed and some dismissed the dangers of the virus.The New York Times reported that people fell ill with coronavirus in Florida, and then returned home with the virus.Florida’s beach reopenings also come amid Trump’s calls to reopen the US economy and growing protests in some states, driven by rightwing figures, about social and business restrictions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db160bee9d576477523af83ead3cda2097d5896/0_0_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5efd82ad1e933d9b21ce180acd4d6fd","title":"coronavirus stress baking sourdough kneading relax","story":"With the pandemic confining millions to their homes, bread baking has become a meditative and empowering actCarl Anhalt hadn’t made a loaf of bread in years. But stuck in his New York City apartment during the coronavirus lockdown, he started thinking about bread again. Anhalt works as a high school math teacher, and like many educators he now spends his weeks dealing with meetings, emails and distance learning. But when his school recently went on spring break, he began working on a sourdough starter, posting pictures of his progress on Instagram.He says it’s helped him feel productive and deal with stress. “It was a good exercise in mindfulness and a distraction from thinking about the world, so in those ways it certainly eased some anxiety,” he says.Baking your way through anxiety or uncertainty is nothing new – in fact anxiety has been on the rise since 2016, according to the American Psychiatric Association, and baking has climbed with it. But with the pandemic confining millions to their homes, the practice is rising faster than a packet of quick-acting yeast.While cakes, cookies, noodles and pastas are all proving popular, bread has emerged as the baking project of choice. Yeast shortages have been reported in supermarkets across the UK and the US, with yeast suppliers calling the current demand “unprecedented”. In France and Australia, flour is becoming hard to find. Google has documented an all-time high in queries about bread, including yeast, and “how to make bread without yeast.”Clemence Gossett, the founder and co-owner of The Gourmandise School in Santa Monica, California, says she was initially surprised by the turn to bread – she initially thought that people prefer making cakes and cookies. But she surmises that people have been attracted to bread baking not just because of its practicality as a grocery staple, but because of its meditative qualities during challenging times.Rolling, kneading and mixing all have a calming quality, forcing you to be in the moment and not stuck mentally in the future or past. That may help bakers manage the uncertain emotions. “I think that there is this desire for people to express themselves and it’s really hard to do that when you can’t communicate and have this back and forth with others,” says Gossett. “We have lost that in a way. There’s this wonderful tangibility with baking and lets you work out emotions and express yourself.”Some studies show that baking is connected to positive feelings. Psychologists have started exploring cooking and baking as a therapeutic tool to help people dealing with things like depression and anxiety, and a 2016 study, published in the Journal of Positive Psychology, suggests that people who frequently take a turn at small, creative projects report feeling more relaxed and happier.That makes sense to Gossett – her cooking school offers a class that combines therapy and pie-baking. The class creates a space for people to work on anxiety, particularly perfectionism, using the simple, delicious experience of learning how to make pies.Ken Forkish, the owner of Ken’s Artisan Bakery in Portland, Oregon, and author of the book Flour Water Salt Yeast, says that people are also looking to make their own bread at home because trips to the grocery store have become riddled with stress. “People want to have fresh bread while avoiding the grocery store as much as possible,” he says. “You’ve got time on your hands, and maybe you have wanted to learn to bake bread and now you have the time to do it.”Time is a necessary ingredient for bread, Forkish adds, and that extra time at home has prompted bakers to attempt things they may not have before – such as sourdough, which can take days to produce. Professional bakers are turning to social media to demystify the process, and amateur bakers are posting their homemade experiments. The bakers at Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, which helped kickstart the global sourdough craze, have posted instructional videos on making sourdough starter and their signature sourdough loaves which have been viewed tens of thousands of times.Forkish says the joy of baking lies in producing something tangible amid a pandemic in which so many things, from socializing to school, have shifted online. “There’s a lot of pleasure in learning a new skill, especially something tangible, as opposed to all the things we do virtually,” he says. “The satisfaction of transforming flour into a beautiful loaf of bread coming out of the oven is just fundamentally satisfying.”Gossett has put bread how-to videos up on her baking school’s YouTube channel, and she takes questions from home bakers on Instagram. The school also has a hotline and email address where people can reach out she said the response has been overwhelming – running the hotline has become a full-time job, answering questions about which ingredients can be substituted or what meals to make with a random assortment of food in the fridge and pantry. Gossett is even doing FaceTime calls to coach people through their baking challenges.Gossett thinks the pandemic has prompted a shift in how people view baking as a part of their days. “Instead of asking: how can I make this fit in my schedule, it’s more about how can I make myself available to learn this new process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa363a080b840577c8399130ee588d56ae0e45d3/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae6ef6d6826499d4e1761d005265d016","title":"deepwater horizon mexico 10 years on","story":"BP denied the oil reached Mexico, but fisherman and scientists knew it wasn’t true. Ten years on, Mexican communities haven’t received a cent in compensationby  Nina Lakhani in Saladero, VeracruzErica Ríos Martínez grew-up in a riverside community filled with food and fiestas thanks to a booming fishing industry which supported tens of thousands of families across the Gulf of Mexico.After high school, Ríos Martínez moved to a nearby town for college which she financed by selling blue crabs, shrimp and tilapia fished by her father in the Tamiahua lagoon – an elongated coastal inlet famed for its abundant shellfish.But fish stocks began to decline in 2011 across the Gulf – the year after BP’s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded 200 miles north of Mexican territory. The offshore rig sank and released almost 5m barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days. Oil plumes coated hundreds of miles of shoreline, causing catastrophic damage to marine life, coral reefs and birds.Amid public and political outrage in the US, BP took full responsibility for the worst oil spill of the 20th century, which killed 11 crew members and injured 17 others. The company has paid out $69bn, including more than $10bn to affected fishermen and businesses.But BP denied the oil reached Mexico, claiming the ocean current propelled the huge spill in the opposite direction. However, fishermen and Mexican scientists knew this wasn’t true.“Before the spill we had freezers full of fish. Afterwards, my father couldn’t catch enough to support me, no matter how many hours he spent fishing. It was the same for the whole community, and it has just got worse and worse,” said Ríos Martínez, 31, who was forced to drop out of university and move away.Ten years later, Mexican communities have not received a single cent in compensation.“To claim the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem has borders is absurd, discriminatory and defies scientific knowledge,” said Eduardo Rubio, an expert in soil and water pollution at the College of Biologists.Saladero is a picturesque sleepy village situated on the bank of the Papaloapan River which snakes into the south-westerly edge of the lagoon.The lagoon was famous for prawns and oysters fishermen recall giving away because stocks were so abundant.Now, youngsters are forced to migrate to find factory work in maquilas in faraway cities.“The village is full of us old people, there’s nothing for the young here any more,” said Juan Mar Aran, 78, a fisherman for 60 years. “Before, we worked hard and had money in our pockets, now we depend on our children, even the dogs are skinny. It’s very unjust, we’ve been completely abandoned.”In 2010, the Saladero fishing cooperative registered 11,663kg of shrimp, 36kg of bass and 281,125kg of oysters. The decline has not been linear and publicly available official data is inconclusive, but in 2019, the co-op registered only 1,000kg of shrimp, 20kg of bass, and no oysters.In Tamiahua, a small town across the lagoon, Eduviges Mendoza lit a cigarette on his small fishing boat, parked beside a row of wooden poles waiting for shrimp to fill his small net.It’s dusk, and chilly as Mendoza, 53, settled in for a second consecutive night on the lagoon with only a ratty blanket and a waterproof onesie for warmth. “There’s less fish, nobody can deny that. I’m lucky if I make enough to cover the petrol.”Despite such sentiments BP has claimed that aerial images prove the oil spill’s impact was contained in US waters.Yet back in 2011, Sergio Jiménez, a leading government oceanographer in Tamaulipas state, discovered the BP oil fingerprint more than 200 metres below sea level. Hydrocarbon fingerprints, like human ones, are unique.The oil from Deepwater Horizon was propelled south by the deep underwater current – distinct from the surface current, according to Jiménez, who in 2013 testified in a Louisiana court tasked with managing hundreds of claims against BP.But the case was dismissed after the court ruled that Mexico’s lawsuit, filed by the then president, Enrique Peña Nieto, just days before the deadline, superseded inidual state claims. The case trundled along until in 2018, the Mexican government withdrew the lawsuit and settled the case for $25.5m – absolving BP from responsibility for polluting Mexican waters. The secret deal, exposed in a joint investigation by BuzzFeed and the transparency group Poder, means the company no longer faces claims by any Mexican government entity.Around the same time, the outgoing President Peña Nieto made several multimillion-dollar deals with BP. Hundreds of the company’s petrol stations have opened across the country.Jiménez stands by his findings and a recent study by the University of Miami backed his research, concluding that the spread of oil was far greater and more catastrophic than previously thought, as satellites and aerial images failed to detect oil at lower concentrations below the surface.In part, this is probably due to the unprecedented quantities of toxic chemicals (dispersants) BP applied in order to stop visible oil plumes making landfall.“It could take at least 20 to 25 years for the ecosystem to recover because of the deepwater contamination,” said the investigative oceanographer Luis Soto.But scientific study, like compensation, has been massively skewed.In Mexico no long-term studies monitoring the impact of the spill and the dispersants have been conducted.By contrast in the US, a research working group created by BP conducted more than 240 studies, which cost $1.3bn in less than five years after the spill. BP also set up a $500m, 10-year program to monitor US waters just over a month after the spill and aid to restore the ecosystem.BP has not directly funded any studies or working groups in Mexico, but the battle for justice goes on.In Mexico, a class-action lawsuit was launched against four BP subsidiaries – two headquartered in Texas, two in Mexico – in December 2015, by an NGO working with pro bono lawyers specialising in environmental disasters.It took two years and several court orders to track down the correct addresses of the Mexican subsidiaries in order to kickstart proceedings. Finally, in September 2019, the lawsuit was authorised to proceed despite BP’s efforts to have it dismissed, but is currently on hold since BP appealed.“BP’s pattern has been to deny everything, and claim the class action no merit, meanwhile settling many cases worth billions of dollars in the US. The position of BP is sad, but so is the position of the Mexican government which has ignored the plight of its own people,” said lawyer Karla Borja.In 2019, Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Amlo), promised the fishermen a fair deal. “Amlo promised to make the company pay. But so far we’ve seen nothing but nice words and meetings,” said Aran, the co-op president.In Louisiana, more than 110 cases involving thousands of Mexicans remain open, but have yet to be heard. Scores more have been dismissed.In March, the fishermen leading 41 of those cases wrote to the new CEO of BP, Bernard Looney, requesting he do the right thing and compensate the Mexicans affected by the oil spill.In a statement BP said: “All available evidence confirms that oil from the Deepwater Horizon incident did not reach Mexican waters or shorelines … We value the opportunity to do business in Mexico, and we are committed to the highest standards of conduct and full compliance with the laws.”In Saladero, shortly before the 10th anniversary of the disaster, about 150 people turned out for the town hall-style meeting, to share stories of hardship resulting from the demise of the lagoon which has ided families and crushed educational and career ambitions.The primary school has fewer than 30 enrolled pupils, compared with more than a hundred before the spill. The only gas station shut down and abandoned boats dot the riverbank.Numerous parents said they were forced to pull their children out of college so they could start work and send home remittances to support the family.“There’s no money because there’s no fish, that’s why all our young people leave,” said Juana Constantino, 59, who cares for her grandson while her daughter works in a maquila in Reynosa, one of Mexico’s most dangerous border towns. “We need compensation, we want justice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f1ca0b09fa49a432c15fe88b4c2334f1dd1eec2/0_101_5506_3304/master/5506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bea6d87aa6e0ab26a80ec0401ef0bfe","title":"joe biden alexandria ocasio cortez democrats","story":"The Sanders-supporting congresswoman has yet to offer her endorsement. Is Biden prepared to go bold to win her over?Progressive favorite Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hasn’t made an appearance on Joe Biden’s live stream. The New York congresswoman hasn’t cut a video message for the man Democrats will send out to defeat Donald Trump in November, and she hasn’t sent out fundraising emails on his behalf.As the party aligned behind Biden last week in a show of unity, with endorsements from Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama, Ocasio-Cortez has yet to offer a full-throated endorsement of his presidential bid. While the 30-year-old politician intends to vote for Biden in November, her active support will be harder won.“Unity isn’t a feeling,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview on ABC’s The View this week. “It’s a process and I think that Biden can go further.”Yet Biden has for more than a year resisted calls to embrace liberal policies like universal healthcare and the Green New Deal. He won anyway.Now as the presumptive nominee, Biden is considering policy overtures to the left while courting leaders like Ocasio-Cortez, who is popular with young, progressive voters of color – one of the constituencies he is struggling to win over.Winning the endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman member of Congress and the heir apparent to Sanders’ leftwing political movement, could go a long way to unlocking their support.As a top surrogate for Sanders’ presidential campaign, she drew larger crowds in Iowa than many of his top rivals, including Biden. She has a bigger online presence than Biden and, as a congresswoman representing some of the New York communities hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, is a prominent voice on a crisis that is reshaping American politics.Her social media stardom and young followers could be particularly helpful to Biden, as the coronavirus outbreak forces his campaign to pivot to an all-digital strategy. Biden, an old-school, retail politician, has at times struggled to break through online, eclipsed by Trump’s expansive internet operation.At the same time, Ocasio-Cortez has been demonized on the right, cast as an extremist who wants to turn the US into Venezuela. Her public support may help fuel the Trump campaign’s attacks on Biden as a Sanders-style Democrat in disguise.“AOC is one of the many young people who were inspired by Senator Sanders,” said Sarah Audelo, executive director of Alliance for Youth Action, referring to Ocasio-Cortez by her nickname. “The power of her endorsement, if she is able to get to the place of endorsing Joe Biden, will be in the story of how she got there – how a Biden presidency is going to move us closer to winning on X, Y and Z issues and how supporting Biden is key to advancing our movement.”In a January interview with New York Magazine, Ocasio-Cortez said that “in any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party”.Now that he is her party’s presumptive nominee, she is wagering her political capital to see how far she can push him.In interviews last week, she argued that the response to the coronavirus demands sweeping economic reforms that will help the nation recover from the crisis and make it more resilient in the future.“This pandemic has just exposed us,” Ocasio-Cortez explained on the Daily. “People tell me, ‘I cannot believe I didn’t see this before. I cannot believe I didn’t see this before.’ I’m just thankful that people are seeing it now.”Ocasio-Cortez believes the crisis has created more room for compromise, contending that the success of party unification efforts – and possibly the outcome of the presidential election – may depend on it.“It’s not just about this boding well for progressives,” she said. “It’s about us having a goddamn planet to live on in 10 years or in 20 years. It’s about making sure that babies don’t get put in a cage again. It’s about making sure that we end the scourge of mass incarceration.”As of Friday, Ocasio-Cortez and Biden had yet to speak directly since Biden’s last rival in the primary race, Sanders – a mentor of Ocasio-Cortez – dropped out. But last week Biden’s team reached out to her staff, days after she told the New York Times that she had yet to hear from his campaign. The discussions, she said, revolved around his policy positions on healthcare, immigration and climate change.These discussions are part of a wider effort by the Biden campaign to engage progressive leaders and organizers.During a joint livestream this week, when Sanders endorsed Biden, they announced that their teams were developing six policy taskforces to find common solutions on issues involving the economy, healthcare, education, criminal justice, immigration and climate change.Biden has also recently embraced proposals to cancel student loan debt for certain middle- and low-income borrowers and to lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 in an effort to expand the federal insurance program. Ocasio-Cortez, however, called Biden’s Medicare proposal “almost insulting” in the New York Times interview and said that Hillary Clinton had proposed lowering it to 50.Meanwhile, in an online conversation with a women’s networking group, the Wing, Ocasio-Cortez said it was “legitimate” to discuss the recent sexual assault allegation against Biden, which his campaign has denied.Her role as a leading progressive voice, she explained, was to “push back against everyone”, including her own party.“That makes people uncomfortable,” she said. “but we’re just not where we need to be right now.”At the same time, Ocasio-Cortez is strident in her resolve to “rally around” Biden, calling the November presidential election a “matter of life and death” for her constituents, primarily people of color and immigrants.Though there are some progressives resisting calls for party unity, Democrats appear to have little appetite for the drama and infighting that defined the 2016 primary contest. Fear of a drawn-out nomination battle in 2020 proved unfounded as the primary resolved far sooner and more amicably than most expected.“This is an existential moment for Americans – not just with this pandemic, but with this presidency,” said Addisu Demissie, who was New Jersey senator Cory Booker’s presidential campaign manager until he ended his run in January. “There’s going to be plenty of time during a Biden presidency – as there was during an Obama presidency – to negotiate within ‘the family’ and figure out how far we want to push things.”Against this backdrop, many Democrats are cautiously optimistic.But party leaders are under no illusion that defeating Trump will be easy – he has strong support in battleground states, a campaign operation that is larger and better funded, and the built-in advantages that come with incumbency. Polls suggest the race will be close and won, once again, on the margins.Whether Ocasio-Cortez and Biden join forces to defeat Trump or instead continue to march separately in the same direction could be instructive for the rest of the progressive movement.“Right now it’s a balance between pushing the movement forward – fighting for the most progressive agenda possible – and staying focused on the main goal,” said Marisa Franco, director and cofounder of Mijente, a Latinx advocacy group that endorsed Sanders. “Removing Trump from office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932a59f304fcdd8f09fff98cdc1ea35832d65ca8/0_106_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa482ae489cd83fc78921bf26ca81d0b","title":"how has access to outside space impacted you during the lockdown","story":"We would like to know how your experience of lockdown in the UK has been shaped by your access to outdoor spaceWith lockdowns in place around the world, we know that the experience of staying indoors is very different depending on your access to outdoor space.We’d like to hear how your access to space has impacted you over the last three weeks.

That’s why I have made it clear to councils that all parks must remain open,” he said.The announcement comes weeks after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, threatened a ban on outdoor exercise on the weekend that Brockwell Park, in south London, was controversially closed in response to a reported influx of sunbathers. Analysis by the  has revealed that park closures would disproportionately effect the most deprived Londoners.Jenrick also addressed reports of mourners being turned away from funerals, pointing to the case of 13-year-old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton, who died after contracting Covid-19.He said the tragedy was compounded after Ismail’s family could not attend his funeral. “That is not right and it shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “For clarity, funerals can go ahead with close family present.”The government will publish further guidance on funerals, Jenrick said, adding: “I’m also asking councils to keep open or indeed to reopen cemeteries and graveyards ... for people to make that private visit and seek solace at the grave of someone you’ve loved or to privately lay flowers.“There have been times in my life when I have needed to do that.

He says his house in Herefordshire is his main home, despite the fact his children and wife attend school and work in London.He responded: “I joined my family at our home in Herefordshire as soon as I was able to do so, as soon as we made the decision that it was no longer necessary to work in person in Westminster.“I’ve been there since I’ve been working from home and returned to Westminster last night to do this press conference because parliament returns next week.”The briefing came as the number of people to die in UK hospitals rose by 888 to 15,464."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59162406ec97d3ab9f982cedabcf19e1569969e/442_371_4245_2547/master/4245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2e0f6d1c218623c102131b7ddd0830f","title":"how did britain get its response to coronavirus so wrong","story":"As the warnings grew louder, the government was distracted by Brexit. On testing, contact tracing and equipment supply, there was a failure to prepare By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhan were starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.As the mystery illness spread in one of China’s major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03 after a government cover-up.One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for “spreading rumours online”, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his “misdemeanour” and promising not to repeat it.Many early cases were linked to the city’s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species – in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater – before infecting humans.But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of flu with fairly mild symptoms.But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK’s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. “I think there was some over-confidence,” admitted one very senior Tory last week.The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all – and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February – five days after Li’s death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.In a sign of where priorities lay – and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east – Hancock wasted no time recording a video of himself grinning with delight on reshuffle day.He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to “get cracking” and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories’ manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of “dealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe” before adding, as the grin returned: “Now let’s get back to work!”It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government’s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January – a period during which more than 14,000 people (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 – and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight – hard questions have to be asked.We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government’s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be “a very good result” for the UK.As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany’s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March – later than many other countries – that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.“WHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a ‘public health emergency of international concern’,” said Nabarro.“That is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then – to every country in the world – that we were facing something very serious indeed.”Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.A WHO official warned then that it was possible that human-to-human transmission had occurred in families of victims – a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast – and, inside China, officials were quietly told to prepare for a pandemic.There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing’s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman rowed back from his colleague’s claim.Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China’s dilemma and its approach – shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control – might have to be our nightmare within weeks.In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.In a speech on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. “We are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,” he said, “when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.“Then, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.”By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them.Many also brought in some social distancing measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China’s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.Writing in the Observer last month, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. “Rather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.“The plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards ‘herd immunity’, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.”It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy’s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Guiseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government’s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was “likely to spread a bit more” suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing “herd immunity” had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. “I must level with you,” Johnson told reporters. “More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.” On 18 March – just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards – the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a “screeching U-turn”. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government’s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients “for a few hours”. “If we had been told that that was the case… we’d have said: ‘Don’t bother, you’re wasting your time. That’s of no use’,” she told the Financial Times.Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, “we wouldn’t be starting from this place”. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government “it almost seems wrong to be critical”.But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.“An early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians – in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face – from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,” he said. “This has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.”When the investigations into the UK’s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. “Given the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,” Bill Gates predicted several years ago. “And it will have the impact of a nuclear war,” he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.For its part, the WHO prepared – several years ago – a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called “disease X” – “a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown”.As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. “But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don’t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.”Then came the appearance of Covid-19 – caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus – in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.“The report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,” says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. “It said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.”For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. “Forty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.”Ewan Birney, head of the European Bioinfomatics Institute in Cambridgeshire, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. “I presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,” he says.Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China – again released in January – showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.“At that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,” he added. “I sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: ‘This one is out of the bag properly’. He sent one back agreeing with me.”Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Wolpert, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.“He had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,” Nurse recalls. “It did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears – by mid-February.”By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. “It was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.”In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. “These were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.”Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. “Then, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,” says Wingfield. “I would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.”Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. “Part of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,” says Ball. “But Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.“Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,” adds Ball. “None of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.”“There is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,” Nurse says. “We had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.”He and many others say an inquiry into Britain’s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. “There is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,” warns Boyd. “But when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.”Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: “If Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.”One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.Taiwan’s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country’s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.China’s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan’s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.The pleas for help from Wuhan’s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving inidual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.On 17 March parts of California issued “shelter in place” orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put some restrictions in place. Only five states had few or no controls.There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame – among other targets – the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.There have certainly been questions about the organisation’s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring. But it began daily briefings on 22 January and had declared a global health emergency by the end of that month.While initially sceptical about China’s distancing measures, it urged other countries to adopt them once there was evidence they were working. It warned about shortages of PPE over a month ago, and since the beginning of the outbreak has urged countries, including the UK, to “test, test, test” to contain the virus – a strategy followed by almost all countries that have managed to suppress it.A senior Whitehall source with detailed knowledge of the UK’s response and those of other countries said: “The fact is that those countries who knew a lot about Sars quickly saw the danger. But in the UK the attitude among politicians and also scientists was that it was really just some form of a flu. All the government’s pandemic planning was based on a flu scenario. And then it turned out to be something different and far, far worse and the response was completely inadequate.”And we are going to be living with the consequences for a long time. Don’t expect a vaccine to come to the rescue in the short term, says Nabarro. “For the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat to our lives. That means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. That is going to be the new normal for us all.”• This article was amended on 19 April 2020 to restore a section of a quote from Boris Johnson’s 3 February speech that had been lost during the editing process.

But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences,” Trump said. He did not elaborate on what form that might take.Deaths so far in the global coronavirus pandemic have passed 160,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The toll is currently at 160,717. This news comes as the total number of deaths in Europe approaches 100,000. The US has the highest toll globally, with 39,089 fatalities.China’s National Health Commission reported 16 new confirmed coronavirus cases for the 24 hours to Sunday, the lowest number since 17 March, and down from 27 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 9 were imported infections, and the remaining 7 confirmed cases were locally transmitted. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country reached 82,735 as of 18 April, while the total death toll from the virus stood at 4,632, it said.Prime minister Pedro Sanchez said he will extend the nationwide coronavirus lockdown to 9 May, hours after the official death toll passed 20,000. “We have done the hardest part through responsibility and social discipline ... we are putting the most extreme moments behind us,” Sanchez said. The restrictions currently in place would however be loosened slightly to allow children time outside from 27 April, said Sanchez. Spain, which has been under confinement since 14 March, has recorded 20,639 deaths from the virus.A day after Donald Trump encouraged protests against strict public health measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus, Americans rallied in Maryland, Texas and Ohio, with more planned for next week in other states. Hundreds of people stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the Texas Capitol on Saturday as part of a protest organised by the conspiracy theory site InfoWars, while in Maryland, protesters stayed inside their cars and honked their horns as they drove around the capital, Annapolis.Canada and the United States have agreed to extend border restrictions for another 30 days to help control the spread of coronavirus, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Saturday. Washington and Ottawa agreed last month to clamp down on non-essential travel while allowing trade to continue during the coronavirus outbreak. The agreement was due to expire this week.South Korea recorded just eight new daily coronavirus cases on Sunday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The nation’s total tally is 10,661 cases and 234 deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a7bfb1e0a608efe9a95f5ce507c77053acea32a/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b432fd7b70f67b1b49a8c1dc4fbb91d","title":"coronavirus uk prince harry rallies military veteran volunteers","story":"Duke of Sussex urges more former soldiers to offer their skills to support the NHSThe Duke of Sussex has issued a rallying call to UK volunteers praising their response as a “wonderfully British thing” as he urged more military veterans to step forward and offer their skills during the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking from Los Angeles, where he and wife Meghan were recently spotted making volunteer food deliveries, Prince Harry said the UK was showing “the very best of the human spirit”.Referring to  coverage, he said: “Up and down the UK, from Dorset up to Staffordshire, there are hundreds of thousands of people volunteering.“I was just reading a  article about the impact this is making, where some people are putting their names forward and are getting upset that they are not being used because there are so many volunteers. It’s such a wonderfully British thing, that we all come to help when we are needed.”Paying tribute to Capt Tom Moore, the 99-year-old second world war veteran who has raised £23m as of Saturday for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, Harry added to his brother William’s praise and said: “What he’s done is utterly amazing. It’s not just what he’s done, it’s the reaction people have had. Again, wonderfully British.”Harry’s comments were made in an interview with Declassified, a podcast series which “documents amazing stories from members of the military community”. Harry, who served 10 years with the military, highlighted the work of Team Rubicon UK, an international rapid disaster response charity, now redeploying veterans to support the NHS at home.He worked with Team Rubicon UK in Nepal following the devastating 2015 earthquake, and said veterans had unique skills of huge value to offer as part of the Covid-19 response.Addressing anyone who had served, no matter for what length of time, “you represent something, you represent community, you represent a certain set of values,” he told interviewer and Declassified’s founder Michael Coates, a former firefighter and soldier.Harry said he was “honoured” to be a veteran himself, and “incredibly proud to see what these iniduals up and down the country and across the world are doing on a day-to-day basis”.Team Rubicon UK is working with the Charity and Community Sector Emergency Partnership, the British army and UK government emergency logistics, and helping strategic coordination of the volunteer response to Covid-19.Richard Sharp, CEO of Team Rubicon UK, told Harry its main effort now was supporting the NHS. “I don’t think anybody was planning for a pandemic on this scale in the UK.

The group includes Julian Peto, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, David Hunter, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, and Nisreen A Alwan, an associate professor in public health at Southampton University.“Quarantine would end when all residents of the household test negative at the same time. Everyone else in the city can resume normal life, if they choose to,” said the group in a letter to the Lancet journal. “A decision to proceed with national roll-out can then be made. If the epidemic is controlled, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved, intensive care units will no longer be overloaded, and the effects of lockdown on mental ill-health and unemployment will end.”It comes amid continuing doubts about how the government came to its testing target of 100,000 a day by the end of the month. Medical experts and scientists have suggested that it is both too big for the current demand from key workers who think they are infected, and too low to be useful for a mass “test and trace” strategy to loosen the lockdown.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) which represents NHS lab staff and biomedical scientists, said there “was no evidence base” to the figure. He said: “No one, as far as I can see, has built it up from the bottom, depending on predicted demand. It’s not an easy thing to do, but even looking at various scenarios would help.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8496277729900608d0a811f93041f17037c7214e/0_109_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7c04fa8d28b6ae2c2c90c33047d03ff","title":"take me to your lada cubas passion for a little russian box","story":"The rugged Soviet-era car is 50 years old – and in Havana, classic models still sell for the price of a houseLandy is a stylish man. He has an ageing crooner’s slicked-back hair, the short-sleeved cool of a Miami Beach architect, and a terrible, terrible Lada car.He’s my go-to chofer in Havana, which sounds a little grand, but it’s more economical than buying one of these babies, which will set you back £15,000. It’s also why, despite the windows having no handles (a wrench is passed back) and the rear seat containing a loose spring like an unkind proctologist, Landy fusses over it like a baby.For this little blue car completes his look. On this island better known for its American incredible hulks, it marks him out as a member of the Ladaocracia, Cuba’s revolutionary Lada aristocracy.It’s 50 years to the day since the first Lada ran off the production line in Tolyatti, a Russian company town – also known as Togliatti – on a bend in the Volga. That means it’s also three days until the 150th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, whose centenary that moment celebrated.A collaboration between the Soviet state and Italy’s Fiat, the Lada was the vision of designers who set out to make these small cars virtually indestructible. The result was the Zhiguli, a bulked-up Fiat 124, that even poets have struggled to describe as anything other than “boxy”.The body was toughened, drum brakes installed and clearance was heightened, all to help with the Russian roads and winters. More crucially, the car – renamed for the world as the Lada – was easy to maintain. The “classic” Lada became one of history’s most manufactured vehicles, with around 18 million built.In the 1970s, Soviet support for Cuba was at its height. “The government gave Ladas to doctors, people working on the sugar farms, athletes, engineers, scientists,” says Hendy Cobas, of Cuba’s Club Amigos del Motor, which has 1,000 members.This set the owners apart from those with the leftover Chevy Bel Airs and Ford Fairlanes from before the 1959 revolution. A friend recalls going to nightclubs and seeing the smarter set beginning to jump into Ladas at closing time: “You knew their parents or grandparents were someone important.”Willy Hierro Allen, the 77-year-old editor-in-chief of the magazine Excelencias del Motor, recalls: “In 1978, I was running Transporte magazine, and it seems someone thought I deserved it. The vice-minister called and told me ‘you are going to have a car’. I felt really excited. The car was blue. I still keep it the same colour.”Cuba’s extraordinary ability to soften and sentimentalise swiftly went to work on the utilitarian runaround. “Almost any Cuban can change the spark plugs, and most can swap the brake pads and fuel pumps,” says Cobas. “Ladas are members of the family.” It’s a sentence everyone here uses.“I’ve seen modifications to the bodywork, new air inlets or extensions to make it closer to the ground, but, apart from music systems, these are always small,” he goes on. “We don’t feel good about making big cuts on a Lada’s bodywork, it’s like you are cutting somebody.”It’s easy to understand why people look after them. The last classic Lada arrived in Cuba in 1988, but AutoCubana, Cuba’s version of Autotrader, lists models from 18,000 Cuban convertible pesos (CUC) – about £14,500. Good ones sell for twice that. It isn’t love, though it’s the dearth of other cars. For that money, Cubans can buy an apartment in one of the best areas of Havana.Following perestroika, Lada’s vast parent company, AvtoVAZ, went through the upheavals felt by many Soviet state industries. Production plummeted and corruption flourished. While the classic Lada continued to be built, the wheels were coming off. In the mid 1990s, there were 130,000 Ladas registered in the UK, By 2018 there were just 179. Countries were imposing carbon emission laws and the Lada couldn’t make the grade. Only in Cuba, with its estimated 250,000 Ladas, did the smoke refuse to clear.“Here, we are responsible for caring for our cars,” says Hierro, the editor of Excelencias del Motor. “When you grow old your son comes saying ‘Dad, let me fix the car’, then your son has a son too, and with time he is the one in charge of the car. That’s how the Lada ended up becoming the car of the Cuban family.”Sadly, as Landy and I head out to the highway, it may be the lingering smell of exhaust fumes that triggers my nostalgia. My first car was a Skoda, the Czech equivalent of the Lada. My dad bought it for me, saying – and I still hope he was joking – that he’d got it cheap because the previous owner had suffocated in it.There’s only so much I can take. I have a second go-to chofer. Jesus is a more austere figure than Landy. He rents a modern Lada from the state, one of 320 built under AvtoVAZ’s new owner, Renault, that arrived here in 2017. It is an entirely different creature and, in truth, it’s far better for long journeys. As Jesus says: “It’s comfortable and has a large trunk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b36619017d424a17a272217bd9ce0269ac7622/161_0_3750_2251/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2ff04db94d25e493628c38dec42be9b","title":"together at home lady gaga and rolling stones headline tribute to frontline workers","story":"A who’s who of locked-down celebrities take part in the global tribute to the the people battling Covid-19 every dayLady Gaga, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones and Beyonce headlined a global special of music, comedy and personal stories in what Gaga called a “love letter” to frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.The One World: Together at Home, broadcast across multiple television and streaming channels around the world, featured a who’s who of pop culture. Filmed from their homes, contributors included Elton John, Stevie Wonder, David Beckham and former US first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush.“I’m so grateful for the healthcare workers, the medical workers, all the grocery store workers and delivery people, the postal workers, all the other nonprofits that are working so hard,” Gaga said.“This is really a true love letter to all of you all over the world, and I hope a reminder of the kindness that’s occurring right now.”Hosted by three of the biggest late-night television show hosts in the US – Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon – the special paid tribute to teachers and healthcare, grocery, delivery, postal and other workers.“We aren’t asking for money tonight,” said Colbert.The event, organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the nonprofit group Global Citizen, was the biggest celebrity effort so far to mark the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 160,000 people worldwide.It is also aimed at encouraging philanthropists and companies to contribute to the WHO’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Corporate and other donors have already contributed some $150m, organisers said.“What I’d like tonight, if I can, is to give you the permission for the moment to ... Smile,” said Gaga launching into a version of the ballad made famous by Nat King Cole.Beyonce did not perform but sent a video message in which she noted the disproportionately high death rates in the African American community from Covid-19.“This virus is killing black people at an alarming rate in America,” she said, urging viewers to protect themselves.Elton John performed from his garden in Los Angeles, sitting behind his piano for an uplifting rendition of 1983 hit I’m Still Standing.He was introduced by David and Victoria Beckham and dedicated the song to those fighting the pandemic: “This is for everyone out there who’s been working on the front line,” he said. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” he said.The Rolling Stones, appearing in four separate locations, sang You Can’t Always Get What You Want, with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards playing acoustic guitars.Wonder, in a tribute to Bill Withers, who died two weeks ago, played Lean on Me, while McCartney, recalling that his mother was a nurse and midwife, sang Lady Madonna.“You know the coronavirus is trouble when a Beatle gets involved,” quipped Kimmel.Earlier on Saturday, pop, classical and rap musicians from around the world, took part in a six-hour livestream ahead of the main event.The livestream featured the likes of Latin star Luis Fonsi, R\u0026ampB singer Jennifer Hudson, US women’s soccer player Megan Rapinoe, Hong Kong singer Eason Chan, India’s Vishal Mishra and Emirati musician Hussain Al Jassmi.The broadcast included social media postings and news clips showing doctors and nurses being applauded by communities around the world, families greeting each other through windows, and acts of kindness in support of those who are isolated and frail.Celebrities called on people to stay at home, wash their hands regularly, practice social distancing and put pressure on their political leaders to introduce widespread testing for the disease.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Cavan is proportionally the worst affected county for the coronavirus outside of Dublin, latest provisional figures are suggesting.While in real terms the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections in the Border county is a fraction of those in the capital, infection rates in Cavan appear to be much higher than in the rest of the country when measured against its actual population.The figures released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Saturday compare cases to county populations.They show 345 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Cavan, a county with a population of about 76,000, as of midnight on Wednesday.However, that would translate into almost 453 cases for every 100,000 people, making it the proportionally the second-worst-affected county in the State.Earlier this month, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) said doctors were being dispatched to work at Cavan General Hospital, after it was reported that up to 70 doctors and nurses working there had become infected with Covid-19.Meanwhile, in Dublin, there were 6,567 confirmed cases up to midnight on Wednesday, which represents more than 487 infections per 100,000 in the population.Westmeath ranks the third highest when comparing cases to county populations, with an infection rate of what would be some 358 cases per 100,000 people.The figures are in a report prepared by the HPSC for the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). It is titled Epidemiology of Covid-19 in Ireland and it notes that the data is provisional.Border countiesOther than Leitrim, Border counties all appear to have significantly higher rates per population than much of the south and west of the country.In Louth, which includes dense urban centres Drogheda and Dundalk, the confirmed Covid-19 rate per 100,000 population is almost 298 cases. In Monaghan it is more than 270, while in Donegal the rate is just in excess of 221.Sparsely populated Leitrim has a rate of almost 144.The figures compare unfavourably with parts of the southeast, most notably.Wexford has the lowest rate per 100,000 population, at less than 51 cases. That rate is almost nine times lower than that of Cavan, and a fraction of those of all the other Border counties.Waterford is the second lowest at just below 88.Even counties with large cities have notably lower rates of cases per head of population than most of the Border counties.In Cork, the rate is 174 cases in Limerick it is 176, while Galway is recording 103 confirmed cases per 100,000 people.Counties around Dublin all rank higher than the south and west: Kildare has a rate of 279 confirmed infections per 100,000 population Wicklow has a rate of almost 270, while Meath has a rate of 216.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Yonhap South KoreaEPASouth Korea on Sunday reported single digit new coronavirus cases for the first day in two months with eight new infections.Of the new cases, five were imported from overseas, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The death toll rose to 234.It was the first time since February 18th that South Korea reported a single digit daily rise. The figure brings its total infections to 10,661.Coronavirus has infected well over two million people around the world, with the death toll standing at more than 160,000.South Korea has largely managed to bring the outbreak under control and has recently been reporting daily new cases hovering around 20.South Korean president Moon Jae-in on Sunday said South Korea’s progress gave hope that the Covid-19 is “surmountable” in other parts of the world. Earlier this year, South Korea had Asia’s largest number of infections outside China, however, it has since been overtaken by other countries.“The government will prepare for new daily lives and the new world order ‘post-Covid’ with the unified power of the citizens,” Moon said.US president Donald Trump spoke to Moon on Saturday and expressed appreciation for South Korea’s help in procuring COVID-19 tests for the United States.Seoul is expected to announce on Sunday whether it will extend its social distancing campaign that was already extended once on April 4th.United StatesMr Trump warned China on Saturday that it should face consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the coronavirus pandemic, as he ratcheted up criticism of Beijing over its handling of the outbreak.“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t, and the whole world is suffering because of it,” Mr Trump told a daily White House briefing.It was the latest volley in a war of words between the world’s two biggest economies, showing increased strains in relations at a time when experts say an unprecedented level of cooperation is needed to deal with the coronavirus crisis.“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences,” Mr Trump said. He did not elaborate on what actions the United States might take.Mr Trump and senior aides have accused China of a lack of transparency after the coronavirus broke out late last year in its city of Wuhan. This week he suspended aid to the World Health Organization accusing it of being “China-centric.”The United States is heavily reliant on China for personal protection equipment desperately needed by American medical workers, and Mr Trump also wants to keep a hard-won trade deal on track.Mr Trump said that until recently the US-China relationship had been good, citing a multi-billion agricultural agreement aimed at defusing a bitter trade war. “But then all of a sudden you hear about this,” he said.He said the Chinese were “embarrassed” and the question now was whether what happened with the coronavirus was “a mistake that got out of control, or was it done deliberately?”“There’s a big difference between those two,” he said.JapanThe health ministry said 568 new cases of coronavirus were reported on Saturday, bringing the domestic total to 10,361. A combined total including 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year comes to 11,073, with 174 deaths.The number of cases is still relatively small compared to the US and Europe, but that is only as many as Japan’s limited testing has detected and actual infections are believed to be far more widespread.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday expanded a state of emergency, which was limited to Tokyo and six other urban areas, to all of Japan in a bid to prevent further spread of the virus nationwide amid concerns that hospitals are already overburdened with influx of patients.BrazilHundreds of people denouncing pandemic lockdown measures opposed by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro snarled traffic in major cities.Protesters in lorries , cars and on motorcycles honked horns on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and the capital of Brasilia, calling for governors to resign over measures that have forced most businesses to close for weeks.Mr Bolsonaro has been a fierce critic of the states’ stay-at-home measures, arguing that the economic harm could be more damaging than the illness. The protests took place a day after he fired his health minister, who had been promoting isolation measures.SpainSpanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez said the government will seek to extend the country’s state of emergency by two weeks to fight coronavirus, but will start easing the total confinement of children.Spain imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe in mid-March that brought economic activity to a near standstill. The government, which has been under pressure from regional governments, parents and some educators to ease the lockdown for children, will begin to do so in nine days.Mr Sanchez said children will be allowed “to get out of their houses for a period on a daily basis”, but the specifics need to be ironed out with experts.He said rolling back the national lockdown will only come when the country’s embattled health system is ready for possible rebounds. The state of emergency extension until May 9 needs to be approved by parliament.FranceThe national health agency said the number of virus patients in intensive care dropped for the 10th day in a row, while the number of overall virus cases in hospital has fallen for three consecutive days.Health officials say confinement is “stopping the viral spread”.The total number of deaths in France from Covid-19 reached 19,323, and nursing home deaths amount to more than one third of the total. – ReutersAPEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Anzac Day 2020: how the Gallipoli battle helped Australia and New Zealan forge national identitiesRamadan 2020: fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranCoronavirus cases in Birmingham and the Midlands, mappedCoronavirus cases in Scotland, mappedCan I go to work?

 In terms of what else goes on on the internet, it appears to become a harmless ego boost.”The “what else” which often goes on throughout social media may explain why so many people felt comfortable engaging in what could be dismissed a narcissistic trend, but may in fact offer psychological relief.Psychologist warn that online discourse can often be harsh, judgemental, or simply insulting, leading to defensiveness and perhaps poor body imageDr Allan believes #MeAt20 offered a window of opportunity for rare praise.She said: “It allows people to show themselves in a kinder light.“It allows people to step away from the self-image they may have acquired from the pressures of being online.”In this spirit of judgment-free positivity, celebrities including Les Dennis, Laurence Fox, Carol Vorderman, and Booker Prize-winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo have joined in.As with many internet trends, others have mocked the perceived bandwagon and posted pictures ranging from wild animals to Nosferatu to represent their younger selves. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one towns collective trauma 1918 spanish flu saved another","story":"When the last deadly pandemic swept across America, the small copper mining town of Butte was particularly hard hit.The Spanish flu of 1918 claimed the lives of more than 1,000 of its residents - around a third of the state of Montana’s total casualties. The powerful business owners who had an interest in keeping the mines running refused to shut down, allowing the virus to spread unchecked.This time around, the town - scarred by the memory of the tragedy - has taken no chances.Butte, which has a large Irish immigrant population, was among the first to shut down bars and restaurants and even cancelled its famous St Patrick’s Day celebrations before the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in the state.Most in the town have relatives who died during the influenza outbreak, or know people who did - a collective trauma from the past which has shaped the present.“Shutting down St Patrick\u0027s was like an earth tremor here but it was accepted with wisdom and understanding,” Father Patrick Beretta, the priest at Butte’s Immaculate Conception and St Patrick Parishes, told the . “I walked my dogs that day and I did not see a single gathering - a seismic departure from the wild celebrations of the past.”Father Beretta, who is studying how communities build resilience, promptly decided to take his service online: broadcasting live on YouTube on Sundays rather than risk the health of his congregation.“We had closed our churches even before the order came to do so,” he said. “The trauma of 1918 is still haunting the collective memory of today. As a result people here took very seriously very early on the coronavirus dangers.”Residents began self-isolating long before Governor Steve Bullock declared a statewide lockdown. Butte has one of the highest rates of compliance in the country.Its swift action seems, at least for now, to be working: counting just six confirmed cases of Montana’s 208.The picture was not so rosy a century ago.The saloons servicing thirsty miners remained open, as did the brothels, allowing the flu to run rampant.At the height of the outbreak, 10 residents were dying a day in a town with a population of 100,000. Local newspaper the Great Falls Tribune reported “the undertakers no longer garage their \u0027death wagons\u0027, but leave them in the street as the calls became so frequent.”The deaths only began to slow when the town finally started to close down in November 1918, nearly 10 months after the first detected case.The death toll ended up being on par with San Francisco and Philadelphia - two of the worst-affected cities in the country.“Mortality rate here was astronomical, largely as a result of the nature of mining life, confinement underground and above ground in overcrowded boarding houses,” said Father Beretta.“The Irish Butte inherited an intensely social culture. Churches, pubs, halls were always packed providing voracious vehicles of contagion.”He said the particularly rich “emotional landscape” of Butte was shaped by two defining tragedies and the recovery from them: the 1917 Granite Mountain mining disaster, which saw 168 miners killed in a fire, and the 1918 flu.It was also influenced by the resilience of the Irish after the great famine of the 1840s. The earliest Irish immigrants to arrive in Butte were children and survivors of the famine.“My town was one of the places hardest hit in America, in part because many believed the cure was worse than the disease,” saidKathleen McLaughlin, a local Butte journalist who first wrote about the connection to the 1918 flu, quoted a recent speech by President Donald Trump in which he suggested ending the shutdown. “When you hear that reopening the economy is preferable to warnings of public health experts who want us to stay home and distance ourselves, remember the graveyards in Butte,” she tweeted.Butte, which now has around 35,000 residents, has rallied in recent weeks. Seamstresses in the town have turned their hand to making masks for medical workers, pop-up delivery services are ensuring the elderly and vulnerable are getting daily meals.Resident Sabrina Holland said its history of hard times gives people a greater appreciation of the need for a community to pull together. “Butte people have a sense of history that is so deep within us, that we see a current crisis as not a current crisis, but another thing to get through,” said Ms Holland, whose great-grandfather Daniel Holland died from the Spanish flu in 1919. “It’s such a Butte mentality. We’ve been through so much, we can survive,” she told the Montana Free Press.Father Beretta said that while the town understands the measures it needs to take, it has not stopped people suffering from the social separation that it has imposed.“The community hurts not being able to gather in sympathy,” he said. “But every day I think of the people of 1918. They are my teachers in coping emotionally with this pandemic, they are the teachers of the entire Butte community.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 strategies britain planned herd immunity asia intended","story":"A \u0027herd immunity\u0027 strategy was baked into Britain\u0027s official pandemic plans, while South East Asian nations always intended to contain a new virus, analysis by the  has shown.Britain assumed a deadly virus would cripple the NHS and kill up 750,000 people during a secret cross-government exercise held in 2016 to test preparedness for an outbreak, officials have admitted.The assumption a new virus could not be contained is also explicitly stated in the governments pandemic strategy documents.We discussed the levels of herd immunity as part of that scenario, a Whitehall source said. Meanwhile nations including Singapore and South Korea drew up detailed plans to prevent a virus spreading, with mass testing, contact tracing and huge stockpiles of protective equipment.It comes as the government formally refused a request for the release of the findings of the 2016 pandemic drill, code-named Exercise Cygnus, under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act.A senior Whitehall official involved in drawing up Cygnus, a major test of this country’s pandemic preparations held in October 2016, admitted lessons from other countries had been “entirely ignored”.“Everything we planned for was based on the idea that a disease would kill lots and lots of people,” the official told the  .“We didn’t spend a lot of time exploring how we could prevent it in the first place. Instead we looked at how we could build up mortuary space and intensive care beds after it had already spread.“I can’t remember that we ever discussed what they were doing in South Korea and places like that. It simply wasn’t on our radar. We were sort of ploughing our own furrow.“Given the current lack of testing capacity and PPE, you could say that was a mistake.”Exercise Cygnus discovered that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a major outbreak amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment.The Department of Health refused to release the Cygnus report, despite calls from senior MPs.Analysis by this newspaper shows major disparities between preparations taken by the UK and other nations across the world.While nations in the Asia Pacific region make up 9 percent of the world’s population, they have only experienced 1 percent of the cases, and less than 1 percent of the deaths. Britain, meanwhile, is expected to suffer the highest death rate in Europe. Many Asian nations had already drawn up plans for mass testing using networks of public laboratories to chart the spread of disease, and prevent it spreading, according to documents seen by the South Korea, which has conducted more tests per head of the population than any other country, already had 17 regional and local labs in place ahead of the pandemic. “During the early stages of the pandemic when testing volume is heavy, private facilities may be used to perform RT-PCR tests for the detection of new cases of infection”, its planning document notes. Britain\u0027s pandemic plan, updated after the swine flu pandemic of 2009 took a different view.“It will not be possible to stop the spread of, or to eradicate, the pandemic influenza virus, either in the country of origin or in the UK, as it will spread too rapidly and too widely”, says the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy. “The expectation must be that the virus will inevitably spread and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success at a national level and cannot be relied on as a way to ‘buy time’. South East nations also built up huge stockpiles of personal protective equipment after suffering outbreaks of SARS and MERS in the early 2000s, the documents show.In Taiwan, families were advised to build up their own supplies of masks and gloves, while Singapore said all workplaces should stockpile protective gear.Taiwan also developed a policy of “sheltering” - a detailed plan for a complete lockdown.Nearly all the Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, also had preparations in place for contact tracing to help stop the disease spreading.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The coronavirus outbreak calls for decisive action, at home and abroad, and the World Health Organisation recognises that the UK is one of the most prepared countries in the world for pandemic flu.“As the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans and the learnings from previous exercises have helped allow us to rapidly respond to COVID-19. We are committed to be as transparent as possible, and in publishing the SAGE evidence the public are aware of the science behind the government’s response.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford university admitting students miss grades following a","story":"Oxford University is admitting more students who missed their offers in the wake of Michael Gove’s A-level reforms, new figures show.Of those who missed their offers from Oxford last year, over a third (36 per cent) were accepted anyway, up from 26 per cent in 2016.In 2019, top A-level grades saw their biggest drop since records began, as the proportion of As and A*s fell to lowest in over a decade.The number of top grades dropped by 0.9 percentage points, which is the largest fall since the Joint Council for Qualification’s data began in 2000.The majority of A-level subjects have been re-designed to exclude coursework and modules.The reforms, initiated by Michael Gove when he was education secretary, followed years of rampant grade inflation, with swelling numbers of students achieving top grades.Universities complained that thousands of students with A or A* grades would make it impossible for them to distinguish who the very best candidates were.But an Oxford don said there was some “panic” among admissions tutors about the number of students who are now missing their offers.“The Gove reforms meant that A-levels got harder,” he told the .“We have been in this comfort zone of everyone getting AAA. The students are still given the standard offer, but there were more kids missing offers than ever before. Nobody really knew what changing A-levels would mean.”Last year 663 students missed their offers from Oxford, up from 462 in 2016, meaning a rise of 44 per cent. Of those who missed their offers, 237 were admitted in 2019, up from 122 four years previously.“There is now a debate about whether we need to do more over-offering because of the underachieving on grades,” the admissions source added. They explained that another possible reason for the growing number of pupils who are admitted despite missing their offers could be the increasingly pressure on Oxford colleges to boost their intake of students from difficult backgrounds. “If you are going to go into that territory you have to be more flexible about exactly what happens,” he said. “You are one step away from differential offers, which we have not done yet - but whether we are doing it post hoc is another matter”.Last year Cambridge admitted a tranche of  “second chance” students from poor backgrounds, after allowing post A-level applications for the first time.In a bid to improve ersity, the university earmarked extra places for disadvantaged students who performed better than expected in their A-levels.The move by Cambridge is aimed at admitting more talented students from disadvantaged background who have already applied and had an interview, but “narrowly missed out” on an offer.Implementing a similar system at Oxford is under discussion, the source said, but no firm decisions have yet been made.An Oxford University spokesman said: “We apply some clemency when the candidate has done well in the admissions test (if there is one) and the interview, and if at the time of their A-levels there are extenuating circumstances and the conditional offer is narrowly missed.“Qualification reforms do tend to cause changes in schools until they are fully embedded and that is one of the reasons why Oxford does not rely on just school qualifications, but uses its own assessments including admissions tests and interviews. We find using a range of metrics helps us assess the potential to study at Oxford.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uneasy alliance scientists government face coronavirus pandemic","story":"Looking back, it was a moment that Sir Patrick Vallance may now view as regrettable.As he articulated the government’s decision to pursue a policy of “herd immunity” to the television journalist interviewing him, the Chief Scientific Adviser stressed that it was only following “the most up to date and relevant advice” from the experts appointed to navigate a way through the unfolding coronavirus crisis.Herd immunity, he explained, would necessitate around 60 per cent of the country contracting the disease so that, once recovered, their bodies’ acquired antibodies would effectively protect the rest of the population, too.It was put to him that, with the virus having an estimated fatality rate of up to one per cent, that was potentially an awful lot of deaths to countenance. Sir Patrick couldn’t deny it.“That is a real prospect, this is a nasty disease.”Neither he nor his interlocutor spelled out the numbers, but anyone with an elementary grasp of maths could have deduced that achieving herd immunity might therefore cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. That interview was on March 13, a day after Sir Patrick, side by side with Boris Johnson, had first floated the idea of herd immunity at a press conference.The PM had also taken that opportunity to declare that people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for a week but stopped short of calling for the cancelling of mass gatherings or closing schools.It has now emerged that for nearly a fortnight the government had been privy to scientific advice from Imperial College, London, which had forecast mass casualties from the Covid-19 strain. Mathematical modelling of potential deaths had been made available as early as March 1, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, who led the Imperial team.Furthermore, on March 12, the date of the “herd immunity” press conference, Imperial had presented a further study to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which predicted a quarter of a million fatalities in the UK unless truly stringent measures were taken to suppress the virus.Yet here was Sir Patrick, a day later, insisting that fully suppressing the virus with a lengthy lockdown was unhelpful as it would only lead to a second, potentially larger, outbreak towards the end of the year.“We want to…not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.”Sir Patrick may not have known it, but the ground was already shifting beneath him. According to insiders, the latest offering from Imperial had indeed made an impact and a seismic change in thinking was now taking place in the government’s inner circle. Actually seeing the numbers starkly on a page – 250,000 deaths unless we lockdown the country – had apparently concentrated a few minds.The result was that, even as herd immunity was being expounded on national television by the hapless Sir Patrick, the very real prospect of abandoning its pursuit of was now being actively considered in No10. The government was about to change direction, but it was hardly to be a handbrake turn.It was a full eleven days after the Imperial study’s call for full suppression before Mr Johnson announced that he was putting the country into lockdown. That was nearly four weeks ago, and since then the line from the government has been consistent: stay at home, only go out for essentials such as food or exercise and keep the vulnerable isolated.For now, it seems, the country is on a single, straight, Imperial-sanctioned path.Why did it take so long to get here? Is it definitely the right path? And how do we go from here, in an unsustainable state of economic stasis, back to something resembling normality? The key to understanding the first of those questions lies in the structure of the committees set up to advise the government in such times of crisis.SAGE, and the three sub-committees which feed into it, are comprised of a range of scientists, the identities of whom are largely unknown, apparently in order to protect them from threats. This opaque nature, and the fact that the committees are dominated by epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and particularly mathematical modellers, has led to criticism.Professor Anthony Costello, of University College’s Institute for Global Health, says: “I think that is quite a narrow view of science. You needed independent public health scientists, social health scientists, IT people, logisticians – and maybe citizen scientists – people that understand how you collect data on a large scale from communities and feed it back to them.”Until the pivotal Imperial report was acted upon, it had appeared to some that the government was actually most in thrall to the behavioural scientists. One report, submitted to SAGE on March 4, examined the potential public resistance to various anti-viral interventions, such as school closures, and concluded they would be “highly disruptive” and “likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society.”Some committee members clearly felt it would cause to “discontent” to isolate only vulnerable people. But others said that explaining that the rest of the population was building herd immunity for them “will make this acceptable.”This kind of advice, together with the naturally liberalist instincts of Mr Johnson himself, seems to have contributed to the delay in bringing in lockdown.Prof Costello says of the Prime Minister, “He wants people to be pretty free. The thing that they didn’t realise was that every week’s delay on an exponential part of the curve can be a disaster.”Prof Costello points to other countries, such as Ireland, as examples of how more effective actions could have been taken earlier, as does Sir David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2007. Sir David says that allowing the Cheltenham races, as pictured below, in the second week of March, for instance, had been a clear error.His own son caught the coronavirus while attending the four-day festival, but has now recovered.“I do know Patrick Vallance rather well and have enormous respect for him and think he’s the right man in the right job. I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham.“I can’t believe that that was the science advice. A big crowd of jostling people all trying to lay bets and collect money at the same time, it’s just the formula for spread.”Sir David’s perception is that, unlike in his time as Chief Scientific Adviser, when he advised and politicians listened, now it is more like the other way round with scientific advisers kept on a tight rein. And having worked with Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor, he says, “It was very clear that he does want people to like him and as a scientist he certainly showed that he enjoyed listening to what I had to say, but I became aware that the next person walking into his office who said the opposite to me would get the same treatment.”Having finally opted for lockdown, the government is now being accused by some academics of having swallowed the Imperial study too readily and depending too much on the mathematical modellers.Professor Richard Sullivan, co-director of the conflict and health research group at King’s College, London, says, “They went from almost nothing, which was \u0027oh, we\u0027re going to ban a few mass gatherings here\u0027 to the full lockdown, just like that.”Prof Sullivan says that he has argued for the modelling to include the unintended consequences of the lockdown on public health, but that his pleas have been ignored. He fears those suffering from non-Covid-19 conditions will now suffer.“The mistake that was made was the models were not red-teamed properly, which means you give it to other people in other areas who model other indirect causes, you say what’s wrong with this model?...They were not exposed to a sufficient critique.”The problem with mathematical modellers, he adds, is that the modelling community in infectious diseases is a very closed and very small community. So if you get it right, of course you get it right, but if you get it wrong you can’t see you’ve got it wrong.”Whether Prof Ferguson at Imperial has got it wrong on Covid-19 remains to be seen, but certainly some of his past pronouncements over pandemics have appeared to fall well wide of the mark.His research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease was disputed.In 2002 Prof Ferguson got involved in the BSE crisis, which had years earlier seen the then agriculture minister John Selwyn Gummer attempt to reassure the public that it was safe to eat beef by feeding a hamburger to his four-year-old daughter.Prof Ferguson authored a report speculating that BSE in cows and sheep could cause up to 150,000 human deaths: to date is fewer than 200. Three years later he aired the possibility of bird flu leading to 200 million deaths and then said in 2009 that swine flu could kill up to 4 million.The sum total of the death toll for both diseases was in fact around 19,000.Prof Ferguson, however, stands by the integrity of his modelling.As the debate over the justification for the lockdown goes on, now the government is also facing pressure over its insistence that the use of face masks for everyday use by the general public is unnecessary. The official line has been that unless you are in close contact with someone a mask is not going to make much difference and can, conversely, make people less careful about keeping their distance while making them more prone to touching their own masks and faces.But the Government is now considering revising its stance, following a prediction from David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation special envoy on Covid-19, that they could play a role in our eventual exit from the lockdown. He says, “I’m envisaging in the coming weeks and months that as people start trying to get back to what I call the new normal – the Covid-ready normal – they will be wanting to wear face protection.”He says that after the SARS outbreak in Asia “people used to tell me, one of the reasons they wear masks is they want to do everything possible to keep safe. The second reason is to show to others that they’re taking it seriously.”The exit strategy is very much on academic minds. For this part of the process, we should definitely not rely solely on the mathematical modellers, says Robert Dingwall, Professor of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and an advisor to one of the SAGE sub committees.“There is a space in the policy making that might be occupied by a combination of sociologists, political scientists and historians who have worked on previous pandemics…you could argue there is a gap in the system of expert advice for that kind of input.“Modellers are smart people but they’re mathematicians primarily and that’s why you need to set their advice into a social and economic context. That’s why you need to have an understanding of the real world.“Ferguson for example keeps talking about social distancing as a kind of all or nothing thing. Whereas if we’re going to talk about an exit strategy, there isn’t going to be a VE day where we declare it’s all over.”One problem, he says, is that “the government have ramped up the level of fear to a point where it’s very hard for people to hear the messages about ‘this is the way out’.” He describes the lockdown on parks, for instance, as “cruel and unjust.”“It’s a policy by people like me who live in houses with big gardens.“If the politicians are trying to follow the science, and the science is only giving them a limited range of input, then it might be quite difficult for some of these everyday considerations to get taken more seriously.Prof Sullivan echoes some of those points: I think the fear out there is extraordinary. Now, it’s our view that the fear is out of all proportion to the threat and the risk. There’s been a real perspective loss here.“I keep saying to people we have as many if not more people dying of pneumonia and loads of other conditions. I think life has to start renormalizing again with sufficient care and attention to the vulnerable.”In addition to the search for a vaccine, comprehensive testing of the population so that infected people – and anyone they have had contact with - can remain in isolation, will also be essential. Only then, it seems, can the rest of us – with or without masks – realistically hope to return to something resembling normality.But with the government struggling to even reach its projected target for the end of the month of 100,000 tests a day, that goal feels a long way off, as does a vaccine, which could take a year or even two to produce on the necessary scale. According to some scientists, the only other option might involve us coming full circle.Prof Sullivan says that, even after sorting out testing and the provision of adequate personal protection equipment, “I’m afraid it comes down to this problem of, are we going to wait for two years for a vaccine which may never happen?“Of course not. The British economy and society will be finished by then. So, your only option here is about building up herd immunity.”After all this, herd immunity?But then, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer told the media last week, “The thing about scientific advice is that it evolves.”Perhaps Sir Patrick won’t find he has anything to regret after all.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks largest oxygen supplier asks vets rugby clubs return gas","story":"Vets, dentists, and rugby clubs have been asked to return supplies of bottled oxygen amid mounting fears of shortages in the NHS.BOC, the largest provider of medical gasses in the UK, has told non-essential customers to return their tanks of oxygen in a bid to shore up its supply to the NHS, which has been hit by shortages in recent weeks.Customers were told that their cooperation could “save many lives”, according to a letter reviewed by The Sunday .The company acknowledged that it had “made proactive contact with non-NHS customers to return unwanted or slow-moving unused medical cylinders.”The Guildford-based group, which supplies oxygen to NHS hospitals around the country, added that this was to help stockpile oxygen in order to avoid potential hits to the company’s supply chain.Shortages of VIEs, cylinders which allow liquid oxygen to be stored before being converted into a gas, have begun to emerge throughout the NHS, according to half a dozen medical gas suppliers interviewed for this article.Demand for oxygen has risen so sharply in recent weeks that the NHS has warned of system failures in hospitals that are not built to cope with such heavy usage.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “We have adequate supplies of the oxygen needed at our hospitals.”“The NHS has a robust system in place to flag any potential risks or problems with supplies, before they actually become a significant problem.”Across the country, small businesses say that their oxygen supplies have been requisitioned by BOC in an effort to plug potential supply gaps.Cross Keys RFC, a rugby union club in Wales, said it had returned all of its oxygen supplies, as did a dentist in Fulham.Meanwhile Ashworth Vets in Yorkshire said that BOC had recalled almost all of the oxygen it had sold the surgery.This had meant that their work had been reduced to emergencies only, given the small amount of oxygen available to them.Earlier this month, the NHS said that there had been a critical incident with the oxygen equipment at Watford General Hospital, and urged the public to attend a different hospital.This was followed by reports of a large, unnamed hospital in London nearly running out of oxygen for its Covid-19 patients on ventilators.The move comes as the Department of Health takes on a more muscular approach to its procurement of essential gasses, particularly oxygen, which is needed for ventilation machines to support coronavirus patients needing critical care.The department is understood to be directing large companies such as BOC and Air Products, an American firm which produces liquid medical oxygen, to prioritise the NHS over industrial customers.Resources are being marshalled in a more coordinated way than before, Government sources say, with suppliers being asked to deliver their oxygen to specific hospitals in a more hands on way.BOC denied that their supplies had been taken over by the Government, but said that the company was working closely with the Department of Health to find ways to cope with the surge in demand for medical gases due to coronavirus.“This includes priority planning for a 247 supply to the most critical hospitals and patients,” the company said.Air Products declined to comment.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/17/17/macbook.jpg","title":"apple mac update battery charge life power","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Laptops may not charge up all the way all the timeApple is rolling out a new feature called battery health management that will change how laptops charge themselves.The update will mean that laptops may not charge themselves all the way up all of the time, if the computer believes doing so will protect the life of the battery.It aims to avoid a problem that means fully charging a laptop\u0027s battery puts a strain on it, because of the chemicals inside.

That is why we are expanding this generous scheme for larger firms.This is a national effort and we\u0027ll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that our £330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible.Ministers have made clear to banks that they want them to lend quickly to any viable business affected by coronavirus that needs funding.Figures released this week by the banks\u0027 lobbying group UK Finance showed that only 6,020 loans totalling £1.1bn had been approved for small businesses under CBILS, though the number had doubled since last week.Around one in five applications have been approved so far but many small firms say they have enquired and decided not to apply or been told by their bank that they are not eligible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One researcher said it had the potential to be really, really stunning as it reached its closest point to Earth, in May.The comet that took 100 million years to pass EarthBut shortly after it became clear that the comet was actually distintegrating, getting dimmer as it did.As well as offering a chance to see the comet as it breaks apart, the images may prove useful to the scientists studying the object. Relatievely little is known about the object, which was only discovered at the very end of 2019.Comet Atlas is still heading on its trajectory towards Earth.

That is why we are expanding this generous scheme for larger firms.This is a national effort and we\u0027ll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that our £330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible.Ministers have made clear to banks that they want them to lend quickly to any viable business affected by coronavirus that needs funding.Figures released this week by the banks\u0027 lobbying group UK Finance showed that only 6,020 loans totalling £1.1bn had been approved for small businesses under CBILS, though the number had doubled since last week.Around one in five applications have been approved so far but many small firms say they have enquired and decided not to apply or been told by their bank that they are not eligible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

N95 and medical masks, which offer the most protection and are heavily in demand, should be reserved for health care workers who are regularly exposed to infected patients.A mask is effective only if worn properly, fitting snugly from the top of the nose to below the chin with no gaps. Masks should be worn the entire time you are outside and should not be moved up and down. While no mask is 100 per cent effective, it can help keep both you and others safe when combined with social distancing and regular hand-washing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHere’s a look at some of the types of masks you might encounter, how they work, what to consider when making your own and the level of protection they could provide.The N95 is the most recognisable and effective mask. Its name means it can block at least 95 per cent of tiny particles — 0.3 microns — that are the hardest to capture. An average human hair is about 70 to 100 microns wide.These masks, which are designed for single use, are made with polyester and other synthetic fibers, including layers of tangled fibers that act as a filter to make it harder for particles to pass through.Make sure there are no gaps between the edge of the mask and your skin. This one includes a nose piece that is moulded to your face. Many health care and other workers do annual fit tests that check for air leakage and ensure that masks are sized and fit properly. (If you have facial hair, you won’t get a proper fit. They don’t fit well on children, either.)Some N95s have exhalation valves on the front, which make it easier to breathe. Those masks are often used in construction. A mask with a valve should not be used in areas that are meant to be sterile, like hospital operating rooms.Medical masks come in a few varieties and are less effective than N95s: some filter as much as 60 per cent to 80 per cent of small particles under lab conditions. When worn properly, they can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching droplets when you cough or sneeze.Medical masks are often made out of layers of breathable, paperlike synthetic fabric that is cut into a rectangular shape and has pleats to help it expand and fit more snugly around your face. They are disposable and designed to be used just once.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile they can protect you from large droplets and splatter, their looser fit is partly what makes them less effective than N95s.With medical masks in short supply, many have turned to making or buying homemade ones. Depending on the fabric and how it’s made, a homemade mask can sometimes protect the way a simple medical version does. And any face covering is better than nothing.Trump: US \u0027king of ventilators\u0027 as coronavirus death toll tops 36,000A good homemade mask uses a material that is dense enough to capture viral particles but breathable enough that you can tolerate it.You can use materials like a heavy cotton T-shirt, flannel or a tightly woven dish towel. Material with a higher thread count – which allows very little light to filter through – will likely offer the best protection.Various patterns for making a cotton mask have spread around the internet. Look for one that has at least two layers of material, comes up over your nose and below your chin and has secure straps.Some homemade masks have a pocket sewn in to hold an additional filter.Coffee filters and paper towels have been tested. One experiment found that two layers of paper towels on their own blocked between 23 per cent and 33 per cent of 0.3-micron particles.People have been experimenting with filtering materials, including air filters and vacuum bags. They can be effective but can present risks. Many are not breathable and may contain harmful fibres that you could inhale. Also, the average person doesn’t need the level of filtration that these materials provide.Make sure there is a layer of cotton or similar material on either side of the filter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable,” Mr Jermey writes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe blunt acknowledgement by Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcomes amid increasing anger at home and abroad over\u0026nbspfailures by national governments to prepare\u0026nbspadequately for\u0026nbspthe infectious disease, which has so far claimed more than 150,000\u0026nbsplives globally.\u0026nbsp​“Humanity’s relentless exploitation of wildlife has been putting us at increasing risk of an event like this for decades. And this knowledge has not been some big secret, despite the rhetoric from various world leaders claiming this pandemic couldn’t have been anticipated,” Mr Jermey writes.\u0026nbsp”The truth is, we knew this was coming.”The message would\u0026nbspappear relevant for successive Conservative governments, which\u0026nbsphave been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings\u0026nbspwithin “pandemic preparedness” documents over the past decade.To minimise the risk of future pandemics, Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcalls for the international community to focus on better regulation of so-called “wet markets”, such as the one in Wuhan largely considered the epicentre of the outbreak, and a renewed battle against the “illegal and unsustainable” wildlife trade.\u0026nbspOf the latter, Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent and Evening Standard, wrote last week: “From the financing of terrorists like Al-Shabab to the propagation of corruption and smuggling groups, this demand has done untold damage to the African continent.

Following a quick check-up, the crew will be flown by helicopters to Baikonur, from where Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew\u0027s return.Morgan and Meir will have to be driven from Baikonur to Kyzyl-Orda, 190 miles away, to board a flight to the US - a strenuous journey made necessary by Kazakhstan\u0027s quarantine measures.On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first contagion at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of US, Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are still conducting testing where we can but there is a severe disruption, no question.”The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said a new self-administered doping test, where athletes are monitored live by a doping control officer, could help protect clean athletes, as the agency tries to ensure no one gets a “free pass” from reduced testing during the pandemic.Clothier said that though current testing limitations give dopers an opportunity to cheat, agencies should be proactive in identifying athletes prone to cheating while also cracking down on the root causes of doping.“One thing that needs to be understood though is testing for us isn’t just a numbers game,” he added. “We use intelligence and investigation methodologies to make sure we are testing the right athletes we need to at the right time.“While our testing activities are reduced at the moment, we are focusing on our priority and high-risk athletes and making sure we can test them as much as possible within the limitations we have.“We’re hoping that we’ll see change around the anti-doping world... where more organisations invest in intelligence capabilities so that they can address the root causes of doping and the people behind doping rather than just using the tests as a facade or a numbers game.”Live Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ben Elliot, co-founder of global luxury concierge company Quintessentially and nephew of the Duchess of Cornwall, was to be first in post.He recalls having “pestered” Michael Gove back in 2016 that the government should create a fund to assist food redistribution. He questioned whether the UK’s commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050 was possible without massive action on food wastage, “the carbon emissions that come from food waste are the equivalent of every third motor car on the road”.The Evening Standard and The Independent’s 2016 Food for London Now campaign played a part in convincing him that something had to be done. “I remember once walking home in London\u0026nbspand seeing bags of food being ushered out of a café, and literally seven metres away there was a group of homeless people. It just seemed mad.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe tells me, over a crackly conference call line, that as food surplus and waste champion,\u0026nbsphe has spent 13 months working with manufacturers, retailers and households to sign them up to waste less food.He hails charities like the Felix Project, the Evening Standard and The Independent’s campaign partner, for their “clever, simple, straightforward method of taking surplus from retail, manufacturers, hospitality and redistributing it to community groups”.I suggest his role within government is that of a convener and he agrees wholeheartedly. “I have been a cheerleader and an evangelist for charities like Felix to raise their profile and also cajoling retailers, hospitality groups and donors to support them”.Lady Bamford, the businesswoman behind Daylesford Organic and the Lady Bamford Charitable Trust, which supports the Felix Project, confesses to me that she is a huge admirer of his work. “He is one of the most hard-working people I know. Everything he does he believes in passionately, throwing himself in with vigour, empathy and from a genuine belief that it is worthwhile.“His work as food waste champion for the government is just another example of his exceptional work, drawing the attention of all generations to a problem that urgently needs to be tackled, and one that is even more relevant during these times.”“Only in a crisis do things actually change in society”, Mr Elliot adds after a pause. Last week he wrote a letter to all the large supermarkets and retailers asking them to be more flexible about best before dates and to work more closely with redistributors. He uses the example of the NHS Nightingale hospital in east London – “can you imagine how long it would have taken to be built in peacetime?”.According to the Food Foundation, 8.1 million\u0026nbsppeople face food insecurity and three million have already gone hungry since the lockdown. Mr Elliot says that he has heard talk that the number of food insecure people could double if the crisis continues. He also predicts issues with the supply of dairy, fruit and vegetables “because of shortages of workers”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At the beginning of this month, Defra launched a £3.25m fund to support organisations redistribute 14,000 tonnes of surplus stock around the country. This is in addition to a £15m scheme launched at the end of 2018 to tackle food waste.I ask him if he thinks the government should step in and play a larger role in a sector dominated by charities. “Yes I do”, he says. “What you’ll see is both the DWP (responsible for food banks) and Defra (responsible for food redistribution) working much more closely together.”“And I’ll be lobbying for that”, he adds. Mr Elliot has also been co-chairman of the Conservative Party since July 2019. He predicts that a case will be made for more government funding of organisations like the Felix Project, City Harvest and Fareshare, the three charities that make up the London Food Alliance.Education is also a key battleground against food waste. “I’ve got two young sons,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbsp“They can both explain to me that there might be by 2050 more plastic in the ocean than fish. When it comes to food waste it is very difficult to have that conversation at a school level.”But in the short term, this is a battle to keep people fed in a country that is facing a historic depression. “There are huge swathes of our population for whom food is not a luxury, It’s a necessity.

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits.

Mark Curtin, Felix’s chief executive, said: “The women of Hubb Community Kitchen have stepped up yet again in the face of a global pandemic.“We stand together with all of our partners to get food to people most at risk of experiencing hunger and malnutrition in this time of need.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in\u0026nbspThe Independent, said: “It is a pleasure to have the backing of the Duchess of Sussex for our campaign.\u0026nbspHer support for the survivors of the Grenfell fire is truly admirable.

They’re also using mobile apps tied to payments, such as Amazon Prime Now, to place delivery or pickup orders for groceries. The Treasury Department may even let people who don’t have bank accounts receive their coronavirus relief checks via mobile-payment services like Venmo.“We shouldn’t be touching anything,” said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of mobile-payment research firm Crone Consulting. He expects contactless payments to grab an additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent of transactions at stores and ATMs as the result of the pandemic. Person-to-person services like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle should benefit as well, Mr Crone said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s easy to see why. Even with retail stores cleaning more often than ever – if they’re open at all – handling cash or touching payment keypads stands out as a major risk. With contactless pay, you link a bank account or credit card to your phone and then tap the device on a contactless reader or hover over it to trigger payment.Already, 27 per cent of US small businesses have seen an increase in customers using services like Apple Pay, according to a survey of 361 companies released in April by the Strawhecker Group and the Electronic Transactions Association. Publix Super Markets sped up its transition to contactless terminals because of Covid-19, according to the company. Starting in early April, consumers at all Publix stores have been able to use services like Apple Pay and Google Pay to check out.“I know a lot of merchants are putting signage up at the point of sale, ‘Please use contactless’,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, a Mastercard executive who works with banks and credit unions.Burger King released a commercial in March to encourage customers to use an order-ahead app to pay at drive-thrus.A couple of weeks ago, retail giant Walmart Inc. tweaked its self-checkout system to go completely contactless when shoppers use Walmart Pay. Previously, you had to touch a “Pay now” button after scanning your groceries. Now, you can read a QR code with your phone to pay. Use of pickup and delivery at Walmart is growing as well.A million doses of coronavirus vaccine could be available by September“You are seeing customers start to use services they weren’t interested in before,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman.Many sellers at farmers’ markets have stopped accepting cash, and are instead using apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc.

Some are buying items in bulk for the whole neighbourhood and then using Zelle to collect payments. Others are sending cash gifts to relatives for their birthdays.“People don’t want to handle cash, especially at this time, so they are looking to mobile payments as the b,est alternatives,” Ms Fintland said.That said, the coronavirus shutdown has hurt some types of mobile payment services and forced others to adjust.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastToast Inc., which makes management systems for restaurants, laid off half its staff in April. Earlier this week, Grubhub pulled its 2020 guidance, largely because of the acute situation in New York, where many restaurants have closed. Companies that serve ride-sharing companies, like Stripe and Adyen, may also suffer as usage declines.The industry’s established players are also facing new competition. In March, portable-reader heavyweight Square Inc. rolled out ways for its restaurant owners to offer pickup and delivery options.“We’ve seen so many folks pivoting to online to keep their businesses going,” said Katie Dally, a Square spokeswoman. Independent booksellers and other businesses are offering pickup and delivery too, she said.As more people embrace contactless technology and get used to paying that way, consumer behaviour is going to change for good, experts say.The rush delivery service at supermarket chain Safeway hit 670,000 weekly active US mobile users the week of 29 March, up from fewer than 50,000 in the week of 1 March, according to the analytics platform App Annie. Amazon Prime Now’s Android and iPhone active user base grew 60 per cent, according to App Annie.“It’s behaviour that’s going to stick after stay at home ends,” said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. “There will be muscle memory about paying, and consumers will use it going around their daily life.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Half of those , deaths are blamed on coronavirus.We do not know how the other half died, although some will have missed le-saving healthcare because of the ­pandemic.What we do know is that this hideous virus is killing the economy.The Office for Budget Responsibilitywarns a three-month shutdown will slash growth by more than a third, push unemployment up by two million and raise borrowing by an eye-watering  per cent.Lockdown has destroyed Britain’s “jobs miracle”, put paid to a fragile “Brexit bounce” and triggered what could be the worst depression in living memory.“It is important people know there will be hardship ahead,” warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak, an under- statementever there was one.On your one-hour daily exercise break, you can see the tragedy unfolding.Once-thriving restaurants and bars, busy offices and shops and key construction sites are locked and bolted.Behind every door is a personal and economic tragedy.Despite a torrent of taxpayers’ cash unleashed by Mr Sunak, many will never reopen. Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come. Some of it will be paid for in blood.Without cash from tax revenues, how do we meet Sunak’s pledge to fund — “whatever it takes” — our wonderful NHS and its costly new le-saving treatments The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCan we afford a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state, good schools or the promised infrastructure linking North and South with better roads and railways One day a vaccine will bring this miserable pandemic to an end. But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity. There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished. It leaves headroom for ato work and school.The sooner that begins, the sooner we will see the “rapid bounce back” forecast by the OBR.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was backed by fellow Labour mayor, Liverpool’s Steve Rotherham.But the pair’s call risked a major backlash from unions, who warn that hospital staff are facing a daily battle to find the PPE they need.World Health Organisation official guidance says people need only to wear masksthey have Covid- symptoms or are caring for someone who does.And it adds: “WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources.”It also warns against another of Mr Khan’s suggestions — that people reuse masks. Last night Chief ­Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said they were looking at the evidence and hoped to provide clearer advice on masks next week.He added: “At the moment we’re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. It’s absolutely crucial that masks are available in hospitals and in other settings which are high risk of transmission.“That’s where the evidence is very strong that they do work.”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCountries including Austria and the Czech Republic have ordered citizens to wear face masks at work and in public spaces.In Spain, which began to ease its lockdown last week, police and Red Cross volunteers handed out free masks at bus, rail and metro stations.In the US, New Yorkers were ordered to wear masks in public from Wednesday — despite President Trump vowing not to wear one.Angela Merkel has warned Germans they will have to wear masks on public transport and while shopping once the lockdown ends.And in Lombardy, one of Italy’s worst-hit regions, people must wear them outside. The French have been told to don them on trains until summer at least.But asked about Mr Khan’s comments, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: “There is evidence that it could be counter-productive so I think it’s right to ask the scientists to provide guidance on it.“If the scientists come out and say, ‘Yep this is actually what people need to do’, then we will absolutely ask people to do that. But until they do that, that isn’t the message that we’re going to be sending.”Experts say all but expertly fitted high-grade medical masks can be largely ineffective.Researcher Paul Hunter, of East Anglia University, said public transport or supermarket workers might benefit, but added the protection offered “wasn’t great”.Professor Ben Cowling, who studied masks for the University of Hong Kong, said: “They reduce the risk, butpeople spend more time in crowds then that offsets the benefit.There are many practical issues to consider before everyone is asked to wear a mask outside the home.London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan rightly says it would be wrong to tell the public to buy surgical masks as this would massively cut supplies available to NHS and care staff.He suggests bandanas or other fabrics — but they can’t stop a mph sneeze.Masks need changing every three to four hours but just to give everybody one mask a day means half a billion a week are needed, requiring production of , every second. We don’t have that capacity.To be effective, we also need lessons in their proper use, such as not touching the mask’s front as you take it off and how to fit it from under the chin to the bridge of the nose.“We need to make sure masks are an additional measure and not a replacement for other measures.”Shaun Bailey, London’s Conservative candidate in next year’s mayoral election, tweeted: “The mayor knows nothing is stopping him from providing PPE to every London transport workerhe wanted to.”Meanwhile, Waitrose showed off new anti-coronavirus visors — quickly compared online to Darth Vadar’s helmet.

Keep adhering to the measures, keep respecting the advice from the clinicians, andwe do that together as a society, then in the weeks to come there may be opportunities to begin very cautiously to ease the lockdown measures.But that day is not today.National Medical Director of NHS England Stephen Powis added we could not rest on our laurels.During tonights press conference, Mr Jenrick confirmed a further £.billion boost for rough sleepers and hero community care workers to help during the crisis.He said more than , vulnerable people had been helped off the streets during the pandemic.Mr Jenrick said: We stand shoulder to shoulder with local government and my priority is to make sure they are supported so they can continue to support their communities through this challenging time.The cash will also help to provide vital services including adult social care, as well as assisting heroic public health workforce and fire and rescue services.And he today announced  tonnes of PPE was expected to arrive in the UK - including , gowns - from Turkey amid concerns from medics on the frontline they were not given the right protective gear.He said: Supply in some areas, particularly gowns and certain types of masks and aprons, is in short supply at the moment, and that must be an extremely anxious time for people working on the front line, but they should be assured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.Doctors and nurses were yesterday instructed to reuse gear that is normally single-use only or even wear white lab coats and wash them afterwards.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealBut Mr Jenrick said he wanted to recognise the heroes on the frontline and Brits who had stepped up during the crisis.He particularly paid tribute to Captain Tom Moore as a hero after the -year-old raised millions of pounds for NHS charities - announcing the war veteran would be the guest of honour at the opening of the NHS Nightingale in Harrogate next week.And asked about how Boris Johnson is, Mr Jenrick said: Hes resting and recuperating at Chequers. Hes taking his doctors advice.He has had some contact with ministers, but mostly with his private office here at Downing Street and thats absolutely right.We all wish him well and hope that he takes the time to get better as quickly as he possibly can in the interim.Its Mr Jenricks first appearance since he was forced to defend himself for driving  miles to his second home after claiming he was delivering meds to his elderly parents.The cabinet minister left London for his £.million home in Herefordshire — where he is now living with his family — before making a -mile trip to visit his elderly parents in Shropshire.Quizzed over the journey today, he said it had been entirely in the guidelines.He added: I wouldnt want people concerned they couldnt do something like that to help their own parents.Brits will remain in lockdown for another three weeks to slow the spread of the deadly bug - with the UK government reportedly two weeks away from announcing how the country will emerge from the drastic measures.Pubs are expected to be among the last to open in any exit plan - with the best case scenario seeing restrictions eased for non-essential shops from early to mid-May.There has been growing pressure on the government to outline its plan, with economic paralysis wreaking havoc on jobs and businesses.And Tory former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith warned the government shouldnt treat the public like children.He told the Times: The Government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown.We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children.

Restaurants could serve again with strict seating plans to uphold social distancing.The green phase is expected in July, but could come as early as June progresses is better than expected.This would allow weddings and funerals to take place with larger groups.Wearing of masks on public transport would still be compulsory and flights from high-risk countries would continue to be banned.Even when pubs are allowed to open again, landlords will be ordered to hire bouncers to limit the number of customers and ensure social distancing is observed.An insider said: “The NHS has done a terric job and we really meant it when we said there is light at the end of the tunnel.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wanted to praise a lovely chap called IBY SHAIKH from Blackburn, who has delivered free food to me and some of my neighbours on multiple occasions over the last few weeks. We live in Preston and are so very grateful for his humble approach in this sad time. He has provided us with soup, eggs, bread, milk, pasta, noodles, ­teabags, butter, biscuits, tinned ­veg, oats and all sorts. He has really made us smile and he is our hero. Thank you. From Margaret, Wendy, Norma and JudithThe Bodmin Bikers team travel across Cornwall delivering food and prescriptions — earning messages of support from around the world.It started when Kye Smith was out riding with ­his fellow Army reservist Brandon Lee and spotted a Facebook ­message asking for help.They were joined by ­Daniel Isted, Lee Bowers, Terry Smith, Kyran Wainwright, Michael Bond, Richard Hayes, Craig James-Clare, Mark Davey — “Big D” — Heather Tilsley, David Julian, Doug Shotter, Alan Fisher and Connor Perkins. Their ages range from  to .Lee, , from Bodmin, said: “Five decades separate the youngest from the oldest but we have one aim — to help people in need during the pandemic.“As soon as we heard we could do something, we all wanted to help. We’ve picked up everything from prescriptions and medicine to bread and pints of milk for those who can’t go outside. We get anything people need that is essential.“We’re also involved in distributing parcels from the local food bank and the kids have just had their lunch vouchers, so we’ve been busy getting their bits this week.All of us felt that we couldn’t sit back and do nothing.”Brandon dresses up as Spider-Man on his rounds to put smiles on faces.He said: “This pandemic is the first we’ve been through in living memory and we wanted to show the community there are good people out there who will help those in need.”Recalling a touching message they received from Hampshire, Lee said: “He was lovely and said, ‘I wonderyou could help my father — he’s had a transplant and doesn’t want to go out as he’s self-isolating. He’s run out of hand sanitiser and it’s worrying him’.So one of the team got on to it and left it at his gate. Shortly after, his son rang back and said, ‘Dad’s phoned me and thanks you so much. He sounded so much happier, it’s taken a worry away’.“Things like that make it so worthwhile. We’ve got the ability to make people happy and to make a small dference by people knowing there’s a team out there who are willing and happy to help.”The team have had messages of support from much further afield than Hampshire — including Brazil, the US and Italy, where similar groups have also sprung up.Lee said: “We’re just a group of friends from a little town in Cornwall but somehow people have found out about us and are messaging us from all over the world.That in itself is amazing.”Thank you to CHARLOTTE TERRY for making a hamper for Sarah Whelan to cheer her up. Your act of kindness meant a lot. From Frankie OliphantI’d like to thank Dr LIA CRISTOFOLI and SONYA at Gallions Reach Health Centre for always being on the end of the phone to organise and get my husband Peter’s prescriptions and just be there for us. The video calls bring such pleasure to our otherwise isolated le. Also, the pharmacist attached to Gallions for making le so much easier and ringing us to say ­medications are available. I’d also like to thank LIVE WELL GREENWICH for delivering medication tand their food delivery service and the GREENWICH AND ­BEXLEY HOSPICE for their continued help and support and for the comfort of knowing they are there by phone, day or night and the GREENWICH ­DISTRICT NURSES who look after Pete and somehow manage to make us feel we are not a nuisance.

Seth has accompanied, with his trombone, on several occasions too. They are both also ­participating in a virtual run of Hadrian’s Wall to raise money for the YMCA in Burton on Trent. I’m very proud. Nanna JaneMy son JAMES HARRIS is on furlough and his girlfriend SAMANTHA BOLAM MORRIS is on restricted hours as a dental nurse. They have been amazing in supporting their family, who are key workers and vulnerable relatives, ­making sure they have their essentials. They have been shopping and ­delivering to family members, travelling miles without a second thought for their own safety. They drop stuff off outside, give us waves, blowing kisses and ­smiling to brighten our days. These two are my heroes, they don’t take money from us, not even for the petrol they use. We love you. Mamand Mark xxThank you to Enfield-based ADRIAN WHITE and the volunteers at his charity HEARTS AND HELPERS, who are going out of their way to take care of those less fortunate in the local community with medical care packages including hand-made hand sanitizers. Wish you and your team all the best. PeterPlease can we remember our POSTAL STAFF, FIREFIGHTERS and POLICE as well. They are the ones working behind the scenes and keeping the nation safe along with the NHS.

I have been in isolation for  days. They have put their own wellbeing aside to bring me food and have kept me positive. They are my parents and it should be me looking after them. My love to you both. Gavin and your grandson LuccaMy husband CHRIS TILLEY is most definitely my superhero. He works as an HGV driver collecting people’s recycling. He, along with a great bunch of hard-working men and women based in Winsford, Cheshire, are out in the community putting themselves at risk providing a service many take for granted. They have received many notes and thank you cards, with children waving from the ­windows etc. This brightens up their day and really lts their spirits. Chris has put himself forward on a list of ­volunteers, where he has offered to do anything to help anyone who may need him. He is absolutely my rock, encouraging me each and every day and ­leaving me kind notes and messages, always full of positivity and encouragement. I just wanted to say a big thank you. Mel TilleyI would like to say a big thank you to the staff at SAUNDERSON’S MICA HARDWARE STORE in Wigton ­Cumbria, for keeping us sane in these testing times.

Sandra HarbuttI should like to nominate my good friend TRACEY CROSSLEY BARLOW who is head chef, and her healthcare colleagues at KINGFISHER COURT RETIREMENT HOME in Sutton in Ashfield, Derbys. I have known Tracey for years and now live in New Zealand. She is much busier lately and sounds like she is putting a lot of extra hours in, as are the other staff, to ensure ­residents are well looked after during the Covid- crisis. She will probably be very embarrassed to be mentioned in a Sun thank you butanyone deserves a vote of thanks it is her. Tracey is a very kind and thoughtful lady who I know puts a lot of effort into what she does for elderly residents. Louise MorganMy mum ELAINE is my hero because she is still going to work as a cook for a residential home. When I went into hospital last weekend under very ­dficult circumstances she looked after my son. If it wasn’t for her don’t know what I would have done.  Lisa MataniaMy hero is my husband, MARK NELSON. On the first week of the Easter break he and colleague MICHELLE GARNER were in school every day, plus visiting the homes of vulnerable pupils and delivering hot meals to students who are isolated or cannot make it to school to collect their own. They also collected all of the PPE equipment from their academy and delivered it to help the NHS. Kathryn NelsonI would like to thank NATASHA AMIEE ROSE and all the brilliant hard-working staff at TESCO in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset. They have been working incredibly hard every day to make sure we all have everything we need and they are always happy and greet you with a smile. I think they all deserve praise for their efforts to help keep the country going during this dficult time and they should be acknowledged for the huge risks they are taking so we can all have our groceries. Lorna PuttockMy hero is my lovely daughter HANNAH HASHEM. She’s my full-time carer. Without her I’d be lost. She’s more than a daughter, she’s my best friend. She cooks, bakes and cleans, and helps whenever possible. Love you, Hannah.

His dad Bernard begins the final one at pm, ready for Finn when he wakes up.So far he has made  and aims to finish his th in the coming weeks.The idea was the brainchild of Benchspace, a shared workspace in Cork forced to close its doors to the public. Organisers appealed via Facebook for printer owners to pitch in.Finn said: “As soon as Dad told me we could do something to help healthcare staff, I really wanted to. Each week we clap for the NHS and HSEand now me and the other volunteers are using our D printers to give something back.There’s people in homes all over the country printing these masks.”With an aunt and uncle both working on the front line, the cause is close to his heart. And Finn, who has a six-year-old brother Devan and nine-year-old sisterIsla, said: “I start as soon as I wake up. Two masks print at a time. The first are finished by .am and I put on the last two at my bedtime.”The masks have gone to Mallow General Hospital in Cork, as well as local hospices and care homes.Finn said: “Initially, I aimed to make . But I quickly went past that and now I’m aiming for .”Bernard added: “When we got him the printer for Christmas, we never imagined it would help our heroic healthcare staff who are risking their lives. We are incredibly proud of what he is doing, along with all the rest of the volunteers involved in this project. It’s important everyone able to does their bit.”Benchspace director David Scannell said they got the idea from a US project launched last month.He said: “So far our army of volunteers have printed over ,, which have been distributed to community organisations including residential care homes, meals on wheels and primary care facilities.“We have over  amazing men and women involved in printing, packaging and distribution.”The headgear, made to a strict design agreed by the Health Service Executive, are collected in batches by volunteers from Blood Bikes South and Southern x Response and taken to a nearby sports centre. There, an assembly line works in line with distancing guidelines.Gloved volunteers sanitise the headbands, cut medical-grade acetate into a visor shape and punch holes in the visors before packing up to five single-use visors and one headband into a bag.The army of home printers produce more than , masks a week between them.Thanks to my friend CLAIRE THOMSON for her much-loved WhatsApp messages and Zoom calls. I would also like to thank Pastor JIM SMITH at the New Le Church, Prestwick, for the amazing online services and comforting words.

Our second daughter, NICOLA, is a community sister risking herself every day visiting her patients, giving them all the care they need, working over and above the duties required. Granddaughter MEGAN is a physiotherapist in a hospital on the frontline, our niece ADELE is a community nurse, and our ­sister-in-law LYNN a nurse at our local ­hospital.

Bob Johnson In this time of crisis I would like to say thank you to my local ICELAND supermarket.

I also would like to say a big thank you to the delivery drivers, along with the staff working in the store. I also would like to thank the staff at my local PREMIER and CO-OP stores here in Pakefield. Lastly, a big thank you to all the NHS NURSES and DOCTORS who are in the front line of this crisis. Without your dedication no doubt many more people who have survived this virus would not be here today. Colin GrimmerI want to say thanks to unsung hero “JOLIET JAKE BLUES” in his Blues Brothers cop car with a loudspeaker. Over the past weeks he’s spent hours doing pre-arranged visits to care homes throughout Derby and Nottingham – mainly at his own expense, playing familiar music to the ­residents and carers. The reactions are of pure delight and joy. Many residents have been waving from windows or assisted outside. Some have been ­dancing, waving and recalling the words as they sing along. While they can’t have family or friends ­visiting, Jake has brought hope and smiles to so many in this scary situation. He cares so much – he’s one in a million with a heart of pure gold. From Rosalie BrainTEN years ago Kay Symonds was being resuscitated by doctors after collapsing with a massive pulmonary embolism which left her hovering between le and death.To mark the anniversary of her survival, she will lovingly stitch as many scrubs as possible for an NHS nurse — the perfect thank-you for ­saving her le.The owner of Kay’s Dressmaking  Alterations said business was booming until the pandemic.With all weddings and social events on hold, the grandmother of six has postponed making alterations to her racks of bridal gowns. Instead, she is making three sets of scrubs every day, starting work at am.Kay, , said: “Every one of my items is stitched with love — because the doctors, nurses and paramedics who resuscitated me gave me back the gt of my le.“It is overwhelming, the support and thanks I get from the staff who receive scrubs I make. I’m just a little cog but this is my way to give something back.”The former quantity surveyor switched careers to make bridal dresses after her dad was cruelly diagnosed with mesothelioma, a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos.Kay said: “When my dad was diagnosed with cancer in April , the Papworth Hospital staff were amazing looking after him.“I remember sitting in my office thinking, ‘What am I doing ’”So she left work to be by his side and became a dressmaker.“Eight weeks after my father died last year, my brother had a stroke aged . The care he received from the Lincolnshire Assisted Discharge Stroke Service was second to none.“So when I found out doctors and nurses needed help, I didn’t hesitate. As a family we have so much to thank the NHS for.”She vividly remembers what happened to her.“On April  — a decade ago this week — I had a broken ankle and collapsed at home with a pulmonary embolism.“My daughter found me and I was blue-lighted to Peterborough District Hospital, where I was resuscitated a couple of times.“The paramedics who saved my le visited me in the coronary care unit. I am forever grateful.”Three weeks ago, Kay sent her first NHS creations in the post.She soon had  requests from hospitals and nursing homes from Cornwall to Scotland. Kay set up a crowdfunding page and was joined by four seamstresses.“I’ll just keep going,” Kay said. “I’ll never forget what the NHS has done for me.”Help Kay at gofundme f scrubs-fund-fabric-for-nhs.I would like to say a big thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to the staff at COLLEGE FIELDS NURSING HOME, Barry, who are looking after my -year-old mother and other ­residents, some of who, like my mum, have dementia. I visited nearly every day before Covid-. The staff have made it a little ­easier for me to accept that I cannot ­cuddle or kiss Mum, by making her days fun and arranging video calls from ­relatives, and we can still deliver things like flowers etc. They deserve praise and thanks from myself and all the other families. Ann PownerBig thanks to all the NHS WORKERS and CARERS for all their dedication and time. Also thanks to our daughter VANESSA who is a community first responder and helping out the ambulance service by cleaning the ambulance stations at weekends. Thanks also to our friend JACQUI who is a nurse and working hard during this dficult ­period. Love to you all.

It’s a really kind gesture and a great help. Thanks, guys. NHS workerWe would like to thank our granddaughter KIRSTY-JAYNE GREENHALGH, who is a healthcare assistant at the QMC NOTTINGHAM. She lives with us but has moved out of the family home to keep us all safe. It is very hard not seeing her daily, but she always does what is best for everybody around her. We hope that this Covid- crisis is over very soon. But in the meantime, she makes us so proud. John and Sheila GreenhalghMy unsung heroes are CAROL and MARK BEDOE from Corby in Northants. My we and I are  and I have serious health issues. During these very vulnerable times Carol and Mark have been our “shining lights”, getting in our shopping and checking in daily to see that we are OK.

God bless them both. Angus DarwinI want to thank CLAIRE HUGHES and her amazing team – SELINA, SUSIE, MEGAN, STACEY, DEB and VALERIE – at the Sofea Community Larder Didcot.

Thank you. Emma xTo my very good friend T, who works in a home in Dover, Kent, specialising in dementia care for the elderly.

At least  NHS staff have died from the virus so far.One official said: “Masks sometimes need to be changed ten times a sht, and several gowns need to be worn as staff move from wards and bays. You can’t wear the same equipment for a -hour sht.”Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told yesterday’s No briefing the Turkey lt was a “very large consignment” of PPE to meet the “short supply” for workers in , healthcare settings.He said: “They should be assured we are doing everything we can to correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.”Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, made a thinly-veiled attack on the Government over Friday’s changed guidance.He said ministers should instead stick to PHE rules agreed two weeks ago with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the Royal College of Nursing.He added: “I’m a doctor. I’ve worked on the front line for many years and can assure you for me and my clinical colleagues, this is very personal. These are my friends, my extended family.”Panicked ministers have drafted in the boss of the  London Olympics to be a PPE czar.Lord Paul Deighton will take charge of scaling up production and co-ordinating distribution.Visors, gowns, gloves, safety boots and chemical suits are all needed in hospitals and care homes.Health Secretary Matt Hancock likened the role to Beaverbrook’s appointment to spearhead aircraft production in World War Two.Mr Hancock said his colleague would “bring renewed drive and focus to coordinate this unprecedented peacetime challenge”.Lord Deighton added: “This effort calls for exceptional teamwork and I am confident that together we will rise to this challenge.”The position is unpaid and he will work across Whitehall departments.Top-end firms including Burberry, Barbour, Louis Vuitton and Philip Treacy have all said their manufacturing equipment could be used in the effort. Unions said their members may have to think twice about workingequipment isn’t up to standard.Sara Gorton, Unison head of health, said: “These are worst-case scenario measures, which staff hope their organisations won’t have to implement.“No part of the NHS should use this move as an excuse to ration supplies of gowns when they still have stocks. That would cause a damaging breakdown of trust at a time when staff are working under intense pressure.“Health managers must be truly honest with staff and their union reps over the weekend.“If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it’s no longer safe for them to work.”Advice from the Royal College of Nursing is their members should refuse to treat patients as a “last resort”not handed adequate PPE.Prof Neil Mortensen, president-elect of the Royal College of Surgeons, said Friday’s guidance was deeply disturbing and issued without consultation.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs.He said: “The new guidance implies that, even in the operating theatre, surgeons and their teams may not require proper PPE. This is simply unacceptable.”He said that like all doctors, surgeons are committed to their patients and “many will put themselves in the line of fire”. He added: “If fluid-repellent gowns or coveralls are not available, then surgeons should not risk their health.”Meanwhile, a mother has expressed fears her nurse daughter could die due to a lack of PPE.The unnamed mum said her daughter — a young mother who works on a Covid- ward — came home from work in tears.The mum said: “She told me she was frightened that she will never see her children grow up.“She said, ‘Mum,I have to go on a ventilator, only put me on onethey know I’m going to come out of it. I want to be alive for my babies.’”The mum added: “Several days ago they only had two masks left on her ward. The next day they changed their policy and staff must now wear these flimsy tie masks.“Staff have said they will provide their ownthe NHS won’t give them but they have been told they are not allowed. It is devastating. I don’t want my daughter to go to work but she’s a nurse — it is her job to care.”Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has written to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, to raise concerns about the shortage.She said the Government must “harness the willing and talents of manufacturers” to increase supplies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And in America, , loans worth £billion were handed out by one bank in a week.Shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden said: “The UK still lags far behind other European countries in getting loans to struggling firms.“We face a looming insolvency crisisuptake is not improved dramatically.“The Government must urgently reform the scheme to guarantee  per cent loans to small businesses.”BBB, whose chairman Lord Smith of Kelvin recently sold a £.million private Scottish isle, runs the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme set up by Chancellor Rishi Sunak.It underwrites  per cent of loans made by its accredited lenders to businesses who are at risk of going to the wall because of Covid-.But despite more than , inquiries, until last week only  a day were being signed off.Struggling firms claim the system is bogged down by form-filling and say the BBB is vastly understaffed.Following inquiries by The Sun on Sunday, Mr Sunak contacted BBB chief executive Keith Morgan to demand that more is done to speed up the process.He is due to speak to the bosses of inidual lender banks next week in an effort to unblock the system.When the BBB was set up in , the then Lib Dem Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable promised: “It will be a lasting monument to our determination to reshape finance so it can finally serve industry the way it should.”But the current delays, during a crisis in which swt action is needed, have led to calls for an urgent overhaul.Treasury sources now say around , loans a day are being approved.

This work is not peer-reviewed.”As well, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham Jonathan Ball said that another study had found no coronavirus in the semen of sufferers, suggesting it wasnt an “important reservoir” for coronavirus.He said: “In a dferent study, which again was a preprint and so not peer-reviewed, a small number of males had their semen tested for the presence of the coronavirus while they were recovering from the virus.“There was also a sample of testes from another patient that had unfortunately died.“None of the samples tested positive for the presence of the virus, suggesting that the male genital tract wasn’t an important reservoir for the virus.”Professor of Medical Imaging at University College London Derek Hill said that much more data was needed before any concrete conclusions could be drawn from the study.Dr Kathryn Sandberg of Georgetown University, who studies gender dferences in immune response, said women are known to clear many viruses faster than men, partly because their immune systems’ opening response to invasion is stronger, reports the Los Angeles Times.Coronavirus is thought to be a greater risk for older people, and particularly those over  years old."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove defends pm leadership","story":"It comes after a damning Sunday Times expose claimed that Mr Johnson did not get a grip on the crisis until the beginning of March as he was occupied with Brexit and other issues.The PM is currently still recovering from his hospital stay at Chequers this weekend, and has not yet gone back to work.Mr Gove defended the PM this morning, telling Skys Sophy Ridge: The idea that the Prime Minister skipped meetings that are vital to our response to corona is grotesque.There are meetings across government, some which are chaired by the Health Secretary, some chaired by other ministers.The PM took all the major decisions.No one can suggest the PM wasn’t throwing heart and soul into fighting this virus.This leadership has been clear, been inspirational at times.Nothing is more off-beam than the suggestion that the PM was anything other than energetic, focused and strong in his leadership against this virus.The PM did not attend a Cobra meeting until March , but Matt Hancock the Health Secretary was present chairing the rest.On January , Mr Hancock said after the first COBRA meeting that the risk to the UK was low, even as it was starting to spread around the world.This was despite scientists already warning alarm bells that the virus could be as deadly as the  Spanish Flu, which killed million people.But the growing alarm among scientists appears was not recognised by people in Government at the time.The first coronavirus case in the UK was confirmed on January  - just five days later.But sources insisted that even after our first cases, emergency plans were not activated quick enough.One said: “Almost every plan we had was not activated in February.

He liked his country breaks. He didn’t work weekends.It was like working for an old-fashioned chief executive in a local authority  years ago. There was a real sense that he didn’t do urgent crisis planning.It came as The Sun on Sunday revealed officials are looking at a traffic-light system for how to release the country from lockdown.Small shops, hairdressers and warehouses could be the first to reopen after the next phase of the lockdown ends on May .Smaller businesses and schools could be next, with the public advised to wear masks in public.Pubs, restaurants and gyms would be the last to come back.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs. The report also noted that Britain sent hundreds of thousands of bits of PPE to China during the height of their crisis, despite Britain now being short of it here.Last week it was revealed that some NHS hospitals are within days of running out of full- gowns and will have to wear aprons instead.The PMs official spokesman said back in February: We have supplied them with , goggles, , disposable gloves, , sanitising wipes, , medical gowns and , facemasks.The UK had  cases of coronavirus recorded by that point. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Private email and phone conversations are detailed in the run-up to the  election.

Health Secretary Matt ­Hancock proudly announced that although they wouldn’t be getting any more protective equipment, he was sending each of them a lovely badge that says “CARE”. This is what they have been crying out for. Gowns and gloves stop you getting horribly sick but they’re BORING. Other countries have tried to help their medical staff by testing them for the virus. But what use are teststhere’s no badge  This is why in Germany, care workers are all protesting, saying: “The tests might keep us alive butwe haven’t got a badge, is there anything to live for anyway ” Next week Matt Hancock will be even more generous to our nurses. If they’re still working as hard, instead of face masks, he might send them each a beer mat with ‘‘Angel” written on it that they can keep forever. Then,a doctor has completed a -hour sht and doesn’t complain about not having enough masks, he’ll get a fun helium balloon, like the sort you get when you’ve had a baby. Instead of “It’s a girl” or “It’s a boy”, it will have “It’s a knackered doctor” on the side. This will even be practical, as the balloon can be used when there’s a shortage of ventilators.  Patients can suck in the helium which will not only help them to breathe but also ask for paracetamol in a funny high-pitched squeak, lting the spirits of everyone in the ward. Although the staff say they haven’t got enough protective equipment, Matt Hancock says this is because the nurses waste them by changing too often. This was clearly the problem all along. The nurses keep trying on dferent outfits until they find the right style of plastic gloves to go with their skin shade. Or they complain, “This patient coughed over my gown so now it clashes with my face mask”, and get changed yet again. Hopefully the medical staff will change their attitude and realise now is not the time to worry about looking smart.  Matt Hancock also said he was delighted with the way we cheer the staff every Thursday and was “proud that health workers are held in such high esteem”. The Conservatives have always been like that, cheering health workers. For example, they cheered them when the Bill was passed to prevent their pay rise. “Hoorah, our health workers will stay broke and have to go to the food bank, hip hip hooray”, they cheered.

On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced that the country would need to stay at home for a further three weeks. But there’s thought to be some disagreement in the Cabinet over whether lockdown restrictions should be lted on May  or whether they should remain in place into June. The first scenario would mean restrictions are lted earlier, in the hope it would cause much less damage to the economy – but would risk a second virus ‘peak’. Butlockdown is extended into early summer – it is expected to push numbers of coronavirus cases right down – but would risk further damage to the economy. It’s believed some ministers are unhappy that there has not been a proper debate about the two options, according to the Daily Mail. Scientists say extending the lockdown into the summer would drastically reduce transmission rates and the ‘extremely low’ level of cases would make it easier for health officials to manage the pandemic.  But this approach means the economy would continue to stall. Meanwhile, Tory former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Government should stop treating people like children by refusing to discuss exit strategies for ending the lockdown. He told the Times: The Government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown. We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children. We must respect their common sense. They need to know that the sun is rising at some point in an economic sense.  Labour leader Keir Starmer has claimed an appropriate exit strategy from lockdown is ‘in limbo’ while Boris Johnson recovers from coronavirus. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said that claim was just wrong. Keir Starmer said ministers are failing to take decisions on when and how tothe UK to normal le - and suggested the government has not acted “quickly enough” throughout the crisis. He added: “I suspect, although I donapost know, that  Dominic Raab  is just reluctant - he probably does know that itaposs time for an exit strategy - but heaposs probably reluctant to sign it off without the Prime Minister and I think thereaposs a bit of that in the mix.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mps demand answers tory donor","story":"NewsMPs demand answers after Tory donor hired by Government as coronavirus loans advisorChancellor Rishi Sunak hired ex-boss Richard Sharp who runs a firm which makes money helping struggling firms get access to cash, all of which MPs have deemed a conflict of interestShareCommentsByAndy Buckwell:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsFormer Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp has been hired as a Government adviser on how coronavirus business loans should be dished out\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The move has led to accusations that Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s appointment of ex-boss Richard Sharp could cause a potential “conflict of interest”.The former City banker is chairman at Roundshield, a firm that makes money helping struggling firms get access to cash. One financial expert told us: “The appointment will give him a privileged insight into the market where his business operates – as well as knowledge of government thinking competitors would love. “I believe it is a conflict of interest.” Ex-shadow chancellor John McDonnell is among MPs infuriated by the move. He said: “It is an extraordinary ministerial decision and needs explaining how on earth it cannot represent a serious conflict of interest.” Multi-millionaire Mr Sharp, , has donated £, to the Tory Party in the past. He is on the board of right wing think tank the Centre for Policy Studies. He also owns % in a drugs company linked to the testing of potential coronavirus vaccines. He was Mr Sunak’s boss and mentor when the Chancellor worked as a banker at Goldman Sachs.

A government adviser has told the Sunday Times that preparations to leave the EU sucked all the blood out of efforts to ensure the UK could cope with a severe disease outbreak.The anonymous source says this is despite a pandemic having been considered the most serious possible threat to the nation for many years. It was once considered a top priority and was well-funded until austerity cuts were brought in after , they say. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here “We were the envy of the world... but pandemic planning became a casualty of the austerity years when there were more pressing needs,” the source told the Sunday Times. A damning investigation by the paper also alleges that training to prepare key workers for a public health emergency was put on hold for two years, while contingency planning focussed on the possibility of crashing out of the EU. The government was reportedly warned three years ago that the NHS would be quickly overwhelmed in the event of a severe disease outbreak. A major exercise testing the UK’s ability to deal with a pandemic - codenamed Cygnus - exposed “terrying” failings in . Ministers were told that hospitals would rapidly run out of intensive care beds, mortuaries would be overwhelmed and doctors would be forced to deny frail patients critical care. A report on Cygnus’s findings highlighted problems delivering protective equipment such as masks and gowns to health workers, an issue which has been frequently raised by medics battling Covid-. It suggested that health bosses would have no choice but to “switch off” large parts of the NHS. However, a list of recommendations to address these risks was never implemented.  It has been claimed that stockpiles of personal protective equipmenthad dwindled and expired after they became a low priority during the years of Tory austerity. Despite this, some , items of PPE were sent to China to help battle Covid-. On February , Downing Street admitted that , pairs of goggles, , disposable gloves, , medical gowns and , face masks had been sent following a request for help from Beijing. It came just days before NHS bosses warned that health workers were facing a nightmare because of a lack of protective gear.

Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced in todayaposs daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing very large consignment of personal protective equipment - including , gowns - is due to arrive in the UK from Turkey tomorrow. But the NHS is currently using , gowns a day - meaning the new shipment will last just days. Earlier, Rachel Harrison, national officer of the GMB, said the union raised critical protective equipment supply issues with the Government more than a month ago. It took until last Friday for ministersapos PPE plan to be published, and itaposs falling apart after just a week. It is key workers on the front line who are paying the price for this litany of failure. It appears Government guidance is being hastily redrawn based on availability, not on evidence or best practice. This is downright dangerous territory and one that will amply the concerns of NHS staff. The Health Secretary now has serious and urgent questions to answer. Trust is draining away. He must urgently explain how this apparently non-clinical decision was made to downgrade public health advice in apparent contravention of global standards and previous advice. GMB wonapost tolerate a situation where our members are pushed on to the front line without the basic kit they need to do their jobs safely. NHS and ambulance staff will now face unacceptable risks as a result of gross ministerial incompetence. We wonapost let this go unchallenged and will now review the steps we need to take protect our members.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: The continued lack of PPE is a national scandal and the Governmentaposs litany of broken promises over the last month is shameful. The public is looking on aghast as brave doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are risking their lives to provide care to very sick patients - yet they donapost have the necessary protection to carry out their roles. Health Secretary Matt Hancock needs to sort out the logjam in PPE supplies urgently, otherwise he may have to consider his position as this situation canapost continue, as health professionals would be quite right to decline to put themselves in danger. This would go against every instinct in their body and every tenet of their professional training, but already the public is very alarmed at the rising toll of NHS staff who have died due to coronavirus as they have battled the pandemic. We are not just talking about NHS staff in hospitals, but those working in the community, such as health visitors and community nurses, and those employed in social care settings, such as care homes.

Louise Allen’s colourful, bohemian home is an homage to all things artistic. The -year-old is an illustrator, artist and author, her husband Lloyd, , is a graphic designer, and their two sons aged  and  are named Jacksonand Vincent . Surprisingly, however, Louise’s passion for beautul things came about because of her exposure to ugly abuse as a child. And now, as a foster parent, she uses the healing power of art to benefit the vulnerable children in her care. ‘Art was the one thing that saved me throughout a very dficult childhood,’ explains Louise, who lives in Somerset. ‘When I had no words to express myself, I found real comfort in drawing and creating things. Often shame and trauma are hard to vocalise. But pictures can be a powerful way to help children communicate.’ Louise – whose real mum was an unmarried teenager – was adopted in  and grew up in Oxford. But her adoptive mother was cruel. Louise was starved, forced to scavenge for food and eat dirt, punished with ice baths, and frequently hit. The only respite in her otherwise miserable childhood and adolescence was art. ‘At school we were asked to make a family tree for a project,’ recalls Louise. ‘Well, I knew I was adopted and mine would not be the neat chart on a piece of A paper that my peers would produce. So instead I painted a huge ft tree with branches and leaves for the teacher. Amazingly, I was told my efforts had earned me a trip to the Tate in London. ‘Being in that gallery, seeing all these beautul pictures, was an eye-opening, le-changing experience. Standing next to them gave me a sense of value. They were important and admired, and being in that environment made me have more self worth by proximity.’ After that, Louise – who suffers from dyslexia and dyscalculia, and constantly felt ‘thick’ – began bunking off school. Not to hang out at McDonald’s like other kids her age, but to educate herself about art with trips at her local Ashmolean Museum.  Eventually, at , unable to cope with her cruel adoptive mother’s bullying, Louise ran away to the coast with a boyfriend. She worked as a waitress and barmaid saving every penny until she won a place at Portsmouth School of Art. ‘Le changed completely from then,’ smiles Louise, who ended up teaching and lecturing at the art school for more than  years. It was also where she met her future husband, Lloyd. As students in the s they were just mates, but re-met and fell in love in  and married three years later. It was seven years ago, in , when the family decided to start fostering children. ‘It was time to give something back to society. I knew I could relate to vulnerable children after my own experience of trauma, neglect and abuse.’ Louise, who is currently fostering two girls of  and nine, has now looked after  children in total, some of whom have stayed with her for five years and are very much part of the family. Louise’s calm, caring presence and natural warmth help youngsters feel comfortable coming into the family home. ‘I give all the children who come here a proper sketchbook and pens and pencils. Often they can communicate much better with pictures and images. Children who have suffered abuse will say whatever they think an adult wants to hear, that’s a survival instinct. ‘It’s what I used to do. But they can draw things that they may not have the words for, the images they produce can be so insightful.’  One of the first girls Louise cared for, Stella, was helped to communicate through art. ‘Stella came to me aged five, a tiny bird-like little thing. Her wild, teenage mum Shannon had named her after a can of lager. Her dad was a low-level drug dealer. She bounced between them all and then, with the misguided support of a social worker, Stella ended up back in Shannon’s care.’ Stella’s school teacher noticed she behaved inappropriately when getting undressed for PE, and had bruises. They alerted the authorities and the little girl was found abandoned in a deserted house with no food, water, clothes or warmth. With the security and love of Louise’s family, Stella made good progress. One of the first times the foster mum encouraged Stella to express herself with crayons and paper, her simple drawings were heartbreaking. ‘I could quite easily tell there was her mum, and then there was a group of men with spiky hair and sharp teeth,’ describes Louise. ‘Stella had drawn them all with these big penises. ‘Shannon had pimped out her daughter for drug money. I crouched down next to her and said, “Thank you for showing me”. Stella didn’t have the language at that time but she wanted to share that information with me.’  But there were more shocking insights of Stella’s abuse to come. ‘One day I lined up the kids in the garden to have their picture taken, I said, “Say cheese!” and Stella’s immediate response was to throw herself to the floor, take her knickers off and open her legs.’ Sickeningly, poor Stella had been frequently coerced into performing sex acts for the camera. ‘It shocked me to the core, I felt like screaming inside,’ admits Louise. ‘But when things like this happen, you have to stay calm, put the child’s feelings first, don’t make a big deal. Then try to make sure they don’t do it again. aposI generally put Stella in trousers after that, and when I took her to the beach I dressed her in a one-piece to eliminate her taking her pants off, which she had been taught to do. You have to be pragmatic as a carer.’ Another time, Stella had a violent reaction to a Lion bar Louise had provided for a garden picnic. Unbeknown to the foster mum, it was the same brand of chocolate the little girl had always been awarded by Shannon as a ‘treat’ after she had been subjected to vile sexual abuse. ‘She began shaking and ran off and hid behind the shrubs,’ says Louise. ‘Sadly child abuse victims commonly get treated with sweets.’ Another time, Stella was happily playing when – asshe had been taken over by an alien – she began screaming a stream of graphic sexual swear words, replaying some of the terrible things that had happened to her. ‘I gently shooed the other children away so they couldn’t hear and then I stayed with Stella, made her feel safe and loved while she calmed down.’ Stella’s tragic abuse and exploitation could not simply be solved by colouring or crayons, of course. Louise explains that a wonderfully sympathetic policewoman, and other healthcare professionals all became involved.  But there is no doubt the hours spent quietly painting and drawing in Louise’s calm, non-judgemental company, organically opened up conversations. And became an important part of the healing process. Happily, Stella’s story ends well. Aged six, she was adopted by Danny, who was already a loving dad to three other adopted children. ‘When a single middle-aged man said he would adopt Stella I was full of suspicion and concern,’ admits Louise. ‘But Danny is delightful, he set up an engineering company when he was much younger and made a lot of money, and wanted to do something worthwhile with his le.

Some are raising huge sums for the NHS, while others are using their lockdown time to serve their communities. A group of doctors who were distressed at the lack of PPE available to frontline NHS staff in hospitals have teamed up and raised almost £million – and are supplying the protective gear themselves. Their fundraising effort, called Masks for NHS Heroes, is backed by actor James McAvoy and has meant more than , surgical masks, gowns and visors have been delivered to hospitals across the UK. GP Dr Mona Barzin, who started the group with Dr Salaj Masand, Ravi Visagan and Naveen Anandakumar, said: “It has just exploded. Our initial target was £, and we thought that was unachievable. We never imagined it would get this big, it has been incredible and very overwhelming. “For all of us, this is quite personal. We are all health workers and are continuously in contact with everybody who works within the NHS. We hear all sorts of stories about the lack of PPE and the fear and anxiety. “If we can save even a few lives, it is definitely worth it.” Courier company DHL is chipping in by delivering all the PPE free of charge. Dr Barzin said: “They pick up the PPE directly from the plane and it goes straight out to the hospitals.”  Meanwhile calls were growing for Captain Tom Moore to be knighted yesterday as he issued a rousing message of hope to the nation, declaring: “Tomorrow will be a good day.”The -year-old war veteran, who has nowraised almost £million for the NHS, admitted he is “thrilled” with his fundraising efforts.He originally aimed to raise just £, for NHS Charities Together by completing  laps of his garden before his th birthday on April . Speaking exclusively to the Sunday People, he said: “I am absolutely thrilled that we have all raised over £million for our beloved NHS. “They have done incredible things for me and my family and I am glad that I have been able to give something back to them, especially at this deeply challenging time.”  He then sent his words of hope out to Britain, saying: “My message to the nation right now is, tomorrow will be a good day. “We will get through this and come out of it stronger, more united and ready to face any challenge together.” Capt Tom, who walks with a zimmer frame, completed his challenge at his home in Bedfordshire on Thursday. The money he raised will be spent on wellbeing packs for NHS staff and for kitting out rest and recuperation rooms. It was also announced that Capt Tom will help open the newest NHS Nightingale hospital as a “guest of honour”.He will welcome staff to the new coronavirus field hospital in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, next Tuesday via video link from his home, NHS England confirmed.Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick shared the news at today’s Downing Street press briefing, saying: “We have all been humbled by the gestures, large and small, by people across the country to show support for those working so hard to protect the NHS and save lives. None more so than Captain Tom Moore. I can’t think of a more worthy person to be the guest of honour.”  A kind-hearted teenage boy is leading an army of volunteers to help vulnerable people get essential items in isolation. Ben Thornbury, , from Malmesbury in Wiltshire, has set up a coronavirus advice and support website, on top of his school work, to help those in need. The website coordinates volunteers and matches them with a person who needs help getting essentials. Sixty-five volunteers have registered so far and hundreds more are waiting to join in his small rural town. The schoolboy – who is helped by neighbour Julie Taylor,  – said: “There was no system in place at the time in Malmesbury, so I needed to try and get something going ready to help the self-isolated people. If someone needs a prescription picking up, I will receive an email and then I’ll coordinate a volunteer on that list. “I’m so happy I’m able to use my time in lockdown to help.” A pilot who lost his dream job when Flybe went under is now working as a Tesco delivery driver, to help keep supermarket shelves stocked.  Dad-of-one Aaron Leventhal, , had dreamed of being a pilot as a child and spent ten years training. He worked with Flybe for just  months before the airline went bust – so he decided to turn his misfortune into a positive. Aaron, from Swansea, said: “I was absolutely devastated at first. This had been a dream of mine for years and it had taken a lot of hard work and dedication to train. “But in situations like this, you have to show resilience and spirit. I’m now helping keep food supplies up in supermarkets. I feel a real sense of pride that I’m doing my share in helping the nation.” Former soldier Aaron used his HGV licence he got while in the army – and has been working night shts for the last week.  A menswear designer to the royals is now making luxurious scrubs for medics out of high-end Swiss cotton fabric usually used in £ shirts. Emma Willis – who designs shirts for Prince Charles, actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Craig, and model David Gandy – got her furloughed staff to help out. Emma, from Gloucester, says the scrubs are better suited to current working conditions than the polyester mix normally given to medics. Because doctors and nurses are wearing so much PPE and working such long shts, they are sweating much more and cotton is a more breathable material.

Up to  people have ­volunteered for the project, which is led by Oxford University and will test four drugs. They include the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, an anti-inflammatory drug, a steroid and an anti-retroviral drug that is normally used to treat HIV. The Recovery trial, which takes in  UK hospitals, will kick off within days and is due to wrap up in August. Similar trials under way in the US and Europe have a few hundred ­patients in total. Key Government adviser Sir John Bell, who is part of our vaccine taskforce, said: “If we can see ­evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. “Then, of course, there is the massive issue of how you manufacture at scale many billions of doses.” Professor Peter Horby, another vaccine expert, added: “The UK is leading the global fight against the pandemic.“We’ve set up this trial in ­record time. It’s the biggest trial in the world and realistically by June or July we will get a very clear signal on whether the drugs are effective.” Drug companies and universities across the globe are racing to develop a Covid- vaccine. There are now at least  efforts under way, according to the World Health Organisation. Faces of the NHS heroes who have died during the coronavirus pandemic But despite the hope of a breakthrough, Professor Will Irving, a virologist from Nottingham University, warned: “Until you try a ­vaccine, you don’t know whether it’s going to work or not. You can only prove that a vaccine works by appropriate clinical trials. There is a history of vaccine trials showing absolutely no effect. “There are even some historical trials where the vaccine didn’t prevent the disease, it actually made it worse.

Billy Taylor, , from Axminster in Devon, said he spent an hour working the infected gnasher out with the help of his young son as the pain had become excruciating. The news comes as dental authorities have warned that more and more people may start to take matters into their own handsstrict Covid- measures mean surgeries stay shut. Billy, an aircraft fitter, decided to perform the procedure on himself using a tool from work and a couple of shots of whisky as a sedative. He said: Iaposve had problems with that tooth for about two years. Iaposve been to the dentist over it four times. They recapped it, Iaposve had a root canal. I had toothache running up to the Bank Holiday weekend. It was getting worse and worse. The pain was excruciating. Then, on the Tuesday after, my face was swelling and I had a migraine on that side. I think it was an abcess. I phoned a dentist but they werenapost very clear so I called . They said that I shouldnapost go in until it was restricting my breathing. It got really bad that night and the swelling was getting worse. I was pretty wound up. I thought: aposWhy donapost I just do it myself apos. Billy did some research on YouTube and searched online for any possible complications before deciding to go ahead and asked his -year-old son Leo to keep watch in case he passed out. After removing the tooth the pain disappeared almost instantly but Billy said he wouldnapost recommend that anyone  try it as they may cause more damage. The British Dental Association said dentists have been unable to work so have had apostheir hands tied behind their backsapos since the lockdown began three weeks ago. However there are Urgent Care Centres across the UK, Birmingham Live reports. So what can you doyouaposve got a raging toothache but your dentist is closed  And what are the implications for the dental industry at large - as well as the care homes - in the coronavirus crisis  Eddie Crouch - vice chairman of the British Dental Association- has been talking to BirminghamLive about the nature of trying to cope with patients when they themselves canapost open their surgeries.  Eddie said: Itaposs a really frustrating time for my colleagues in the profession. We are used to getting people out of trouble, not working with our hands tied behind our backs. I am worried about the long-term effects of all of this on my colleagues and on the profession. I am hoping that fairly soon we can get back to doing what we do best - and thataposs looking after our patients. If a filling has come out, Eddie says: Your own own dentist should be able to send you packing material for a temporary replacement. But that of course means having to do it yourself. On the day after the Easter holidays the BDA told its members: England continues to lag behind the other three nations in relation to setting up its network of Urgent Care Centres. Three weeks on from the letter of preparedness indicating a standing down of routine care and provision via the urgent care system, large parts of England are left without effective urgent care. We know roughly half of the  centres are up-and-running. We continue to raise our concerns about the lack of appropriate patient care with the Health Minister Jo Churchill. It is clear that she shares our frustrations over the slow progress. The addresses of Urgent Care Centres are not being revealed as you will need to be referred to be seen and cases will be prioritised. How to get help Due to the lockdown no routine dentistry is being performed at the moment, from check-ups to scale and polishing butyou have a problem, the first thing you need to do is to telephone your regular dentist as normal. Eddie estimates most dental practices are taking calls - generally by rerouting calls from their surgeries to home. However, some are not working that way because they are in isolation. Your own dentist will have your medical history and be your best source of advice. Anyone can ring any dentist - butthe one you call doesnapost have your medical history they will be much slower at responding and wonapost necessarily be able to prescribe you things like analgesicsor antibiotics. If a filling has come out, Eddie says your own own dentist should be able to send you packing material to help you to create a temporary replacement.  If in severe pain or have any of the followingBleeding – uncontrolled intra-oral bleeding Swellings – spreading, recurrent or continuing and or potentially resulting in air-way management issues Trauma – severe dental trauma injuries Pain – severe and uncontrolled dental painTry to be seen by at an Urgent Dental Care Centre by calling the NHS on  . But the general advice is to always call your own dentist first.  Some things you can do to aid your condition If you have knocked a tooth out, try to keep the tooth moist - either by keeping it inside your cheek or even in milk, but do not dry it out. Paracetamolcan help to reduce pain, as can ice packs or frozen vegetables pressed to your face. Dentists also recommend swishing your mouth out with warm, salty water after any dental surgery orin pain. Appropriate mouthwashes can also be recommended by your dentist. A London dentist called Dr Richard Marques also suggests a small amount of clove oil dabbed on to gums can reduce pain.  What is an Urgent Care Centre  These are being launched to try to keep dentists safe while they do extractions. It has taken time to set them up because of the need for a much higher degree of personal protective equipmentthan a dentist would normally use. Eddie said: Other parts of the health service were prioritised above dentistry - even the Dental Hospital went from full services to none so patients are being triaged over the phone. That means for people with infections, swellings and abscesses, they will be prescribed antibiotics from their local pharmacy. If they still have a problem after two weeks, they can be referred to one of the Urgent Dental Care Centres.  From decay... to delay We all know that dentists are on the front line when it comes to fighting tooth decay but given that abscesses can be fatal, their biggest enemy now is time delay. In order for dentists to work in an Urgent Care Centre, they need to be fully equipped with PPE and FFP - a respiratory face mask that has to be fitted properly. One of the other factors which has caused delays setting up the centres has been a shortage of people who can ensure such masks are fitted correctly. The centres are being created in practices with multiple surgery rooms so the dentists can keep working while the rooms are rotated. This is because even after one patient has been seen it will take the rest of the hour at least for that room to be declared safe for another patient to be seen. The risk is that Covid- would be present in aerosol spray and the room has to be thoroughly cleaned after each patientaposs treatment. Eddie estimates the time taken to make each room ready for another patient to typically be from  to  minutes. Patients going to Urgent Care Centres are being told to wait outside - inside their carthat is how they have arrived. They are also told to expect to have to leave as soon as possible following a procedure. Eddie says one of the lessons from Wuhan in China where Covid- was first declared was that ear, nose and throat surgeons were particularly at risk from being aposoverloadedapos with the virus after being in close proximity with multiple patients. Even in February, British dentists were trying to get more PPE supplies, but with China supplying  per cent of the worldaposs output shortages developed when the country stopped exporting.  Dentists aposwant to workapos Eddie says sitting at home triaging patients is not what dentists want to be doing - even in a pandemic. Itaposs been a really frustrating time for my colleagues in the profession, he says. We are used to getting people out of trouble, not working with our hands tied behind our backs. My colleagues are keen to get going to help patients but they also know that every precaution must be taken. We donapost want to infect a patient otherwise a dentist wouldnapost be able to look at himself. At the end of the day we are talking about teeth, not saving lives. The care home time bomb The coronavirus pandemic took on a sinister new twist last week when it was revealed just how many care homes were being decimated. The Office for National Statisticssays more than  people with Covid- had died in care homes in England and Wales up to April , but the numbers are rising and some homes have lost more than a dozen residents to the disease. While the numbers of coronavirus deaths released by the Department of Health only include those who have succumbed in hospital, itaposs has been reported that Covid- has now hit .% of the UK’s , care homes. So itaposs feared the true death toll is being considerably under reported. Eddie says that at the turn of the century, many elderly people living in care homes no longer had their own teeth. Now they often do and are also presenting with dferent types of problems, such as implants. Eddie says: Various projects have been ongoing to try to improved dental care in care homes and people would normally be seen by salary dental services and community dental services. Dental health tends to deteriorate rapidly once people are in care homes. A patient now might have to be transferred to the Urgent Care Centre unit because we are not treating people in surgeries. Eddie says because dentists are closed they have supplied some PPE to care homes.

After a year which came close to her “annus horribilis” of , Her Majesty has  put personal woes to one side, leading from the front as we languish in lockdown. Where there has been fear, Elizabeth has brought courage. With reassuring calmness, she has lted our spirits. Yes, we may be in times of darkness, but brighter days lie ahead. The Queen, who will be  on Tuesday, has united the country once more – as she has done so many times in her -year reign. But there will be no great birthday fanfare. Traditional gun salutes in royal parks were cancelled and while public buildings can fly the flag they are not forced tosocial distancing rules prevent it. The Palace said: “Her Majesty was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances.” A social media post will mark the day on Tuesday, but any phone or video calls with family will be private. Her Majesty’s response is in keeping with the stoicism and sheer common sense she has shown after a punishing period which tested her resolve. Last year was especially dficult for her husband Prince Philip after a car crash. Then her son Prince Andrew became further embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. This year started on a grim note too when grandson Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle withdrew from royal le. When heir to the throne Prince Charles went down with Covid-, the Queen could have been forgiven for wondering when her family’s wretched fortunes would turn around. But it was the precise moment she turned her thoughts to the people of Britain. In an extraordinary address to an apprehensive nation, the Queen spoke with calm authority and soothing sincerity.  She said the UK “will succeed” in its fight against the virus. Invoking the Vera Lynn song, she said: “We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again.” The TV address was seen by  million people. A royal source tells the Sunday Mirror: “You only have to look at her speech to realise,it was ever in doubt, how much she means to the nation.”  Royal biographer Penny Junor adds: “When in times of crisis, the Queen speaks for us and expresses and calms our anxieties. “She will have been very worried about Charles when he got the virus. It can strike perfectly healthy people. One minute they have got it mildly and the next minute, they are rushed into intensive care.” Ms Junor spells out how well the Queen has handled her family’s recent troubles. Prince Philip crashed his car on the edge of the Sandringham estate, injuring three people, at the start of . Just  hours later the Duke of Edinburgh was criticised for not wearing his seatbelt or offering a swt apology.  Eventually the -year-old surrendered his licence. Ms Junor says: “It would have taken away his independence and been awful for him. There was worry about his wellbeing and about the other people in the car. Yet the Queen seems to have sailed through that.” Last autumn, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s favourite son, gave a “catastrophic” TV interview about his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The US tycoon killed himself while held in jail on sex trafficking charges. And this year, Prince Harry decided to leave the UK for a le in America with we Meghan and their son Archie.  A well-placed royal source reveals: “Privately the family were very, very worried about the tumultuous series of events, which really did threaten the very institution. “However, using a very select series of advisers, as well as Charles and grandson William, it was handled in-house without need for the tantrums others had been throwing.” Another source close to Buckingham Palace says: “The Duke of York is largely out of the picture and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are being handled by an American PR company who appear to be drip-feeding publicity stunts. The Queen is behind the real business. Using very few words to rightly heap praise on our NHS and the key workers keeping the country moving forward.” Her Majesty is no stranger to scandal and turmoil in The Firm, as Ms Junor recalls.  She says: “The year  was famously her annus horribilis. “Andrew Morton’s book about Diana came out, three of her four children’s marriages were falling apart. Princess Anne orced, Fergie and Andrew separated, Fergie was photographed topless having her toes sucked, then Windsor Castle caught fire. That was a pretty grim year.” A rare “public fallout” came when the Queen appeared to misjudge the nation’s mood after Princess Diana died in August . The monarch was criticised for initially choosing to stay at Balmoral with William and Harry. Ms Junor goes on: “I think the reason the nation was so lost when Diana died was because the Queen was up at Balmoral looking after her grandchildren, rather than looking after the nation. We take leadership from her. With the coronavirus, this is exactly what she has been doing, she has shown fortitude and given us all a feeling that we’re not alone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i turned detective prove best","story":"NewsI turned detective to prove my best friend trashed home during break inEXCLUSIVE: Caley Robinson knew that a break-in to her home was not a random affair and after two stressful years she was able to prove that it was actually her best pal KatieShareCommentsByJudy BroadbentGrace Macaskill:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsKatie and Caley in happier days \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

It happened on no ordinary day. And the sheer wanton destruction and vile state the house was left in convinced Caley it was by no means a random raid. Through sheer dogged detective work over two long and stressful years she would finally prove that her former best pal Katie Morrison, , was behind it. Caley even uncovered a long history of deception in which she had been conned out of thousands of pounds. Her nightmare began on the day she had organised a fundraiser in memory of beloved brother Tom, who was only  when he died in a moped crash. Jobless Katie, her brother Christopher and boyfriend David Rodericks struck while Caley was out. The entire house – even her two kids’ stuff – was a mess. Clothes were cut up, wardrobes and drawers were ransacked, the bathroom was trashed and walls were smeared with gunk. Food, cigarette butts and beer bottles littered the floor. The intruders set fire to a bedroom, used the home as a toilet and left other insulting evidence of their raid. Building surveyor Caley, , was heartbroken... and furious. Police had no valid forensic evidence because Katie used to live with Caley and Rodericks knew his victim too – explaining their DNA at the scene. But Caley was suspicious after they gave flimsy and conflicting reasons for not being at the fundraiser. She quizzed neighbours and uncovered a paper trail that finally led to all three being convicted. Last night mum-of-two Caley said: “I built the case against them myself and I was determined they wouldn’t win. Now they know, when they targeted me, they were messing with the wrong woman!” Caley had spent months organising the fundraising event at Capel Manor College in Enfield, North London. She explained: “It was an amazing event to raise money for Tom’s college where he had learned gardening. “We had a funfair, pony rides, a barbecue, performances and even a Bob Marley tribute act. The sun was shining and the crowds were loving it. But at pm I got a text from my neighbour, saying my window blinds were fully down.  “I asked him to look through my window. He said the TV was missing and my house had been ransacked. I felt sick. “I had to carry on the rest of the day knowing my house was wrecked.” When Caley got home to Charlwood Village, Surrey, she was horried. She was mystied too... then realised Katie and Rodericks, , had failed to turn up at the fundraiser. “Something told me it was Katie,” said Caley. “We’d been pals for  years and once shared the house, but our friendship had fallen apart when David came on the scene. He was jealous of our relationship and Katie eventually moved out.” Katie texted Caley saying she missed the memorial event because she was in hospital. But brother Christopher, , had said Katie had gone to Yorkshire. The raiders’ story had unravelled at the first hurdle – and Caley was on to them. Without revealing her suspicions, Caley quizzed neighbours and learned the trio had been at her house that day. One local called police after spotting them arguing outside. Forensics were called in and the three were arrested. “I thought bingo, I’ve got them,” said Caley. “I was gutted a friend could have done such a horrible thing but at least I would get justice.” But police dropped the case after Katie claimed to have a key to the property – explaining the DNA find. Caley went on: “I was livid. I was not about to take this lying down. I hadn’t let on to Katie I knew she had been arrested and she was texting me as normal. “It was a really dficult time. I wonderedthe  years we shared as friends had ever meant anything to her.” But things were to get worse. Weeks later Rodericks filed a civil claim against Caley for money he said she owed him.  Caley said: “I was furious. David had given Katie and I a loan as a rent deposit for the house but I paid it back. I knew he was behind my house being ransacked so I was determined not to pay a penny.” As part of Rodericks’ claim, he supplied credit card statements which were sent on to Caley. She spent hours going through them and realised many household items she and Katie had bought were paid for on Rodericks’ credit card. Caley revealed: “I started to notice discrepancies. Katie and I had bought the TV which she said cost £,, but on the statements it was clearly £,. “I delved deeper and deeper and was shocked. There were so many items she said we’d gone halves on that were cheaper than she claimed. “That’s the catalyst moment when I snapped. I was not having this – no way!” Caley, now of Enfield, filed a counterclaim alleging Katie and Rodericks had conned her out of £,. She won a civil court case and the pair were to told to repay £, between them. Caley continued: “It was great and something to celebrate but they had still got away with wrecking my home.”  After sending police a bundle of evidence – backed up by witnesses who had seen the trio that day – the case was reopened. Caley said: “Every time I found new evidence or someone who could strengthen the criminal case I’d call the police. They must have been fed up of me but I was determined to get justice. Police tracked their phone movements to the area of my house that day. “If I hadn’t kept pushing I don’t think that would have happened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"live updates uk coronavirus pandemic","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [click here\",\"author\":,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",\",\"author\":,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-updates-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-\",Coronavirus, which included China.

The powerful look was down to an Emilia Wickstead dress, teamed with a matching hat and shoes - perfect for the Commonwealth Day Service with the rest of the Royal Family. But Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, believes there was a lot more to the outfit than just a stylish fashion moment. She thinks Meghan was sending a clear message to designer Wickstead and to people who believe the two women have a complicated relationship. Speaking on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: One of the most iconic looks is going to be her green Emilia Wickstead cape dress. That cape blowing in the wind as she walked into the church and then walked out of the church, which was such an emotional moment for so many people as it was their last formal engagement as royals. That green dress will stand out in history books I think. She goes on to explain the complicated story between Meghan and Wickstead, which came from an interview the designer did with a magazine.  Christine says that Wickstead described Meghanaposs wedding dress as simple, and taken out of context in other reports left many believing she was criticising the dress. She said: It was a pull quote from a larger interview, she really didnapost say anything negative. People thought Emilia Wickstead had really wronged Meghan, and it turned out that Emilia Wickstead hadnapost wrong Meghan, it was a pull quote.  Maybe a month or so later Meghan actually wore a custom Emilia Wickstead dress, and that situation shows the power of Meghanaposs fashion choices. She was able to say with this fashion choice, Emilia Wickstead and I are great. Weaposre on great terms, that whole thing was a huge misunderstanding and look at the lovely dress she designed for me. Emilia Wickstead is a popular British designed and is a favourite of Meghanaposs sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge.  Christine added: To chose Emilia Wickstead for that design, someone who is iconically British and so iconically royal as well, I think was very, very well thought out. I think that vision of Meghan walking back towards the car with the cape blowing in the wind, it can make you quite emotional canapost it. Christine also believes Meghanaposs first ever royal outfit sent a very clear message about how she planned to approach le in the royal spotlight. Looking back over Meghanaposs royal looks, she said: Her most memorable and most powerful message was surprisingly the one that she wore to the Invictus Games in Toronto when she was just Harryaposs girlfriend.

From -year-old Capt Tom Moore who walked  s of his garden to raise more than £million for the NHS, to the doctors and nurses fighting to save lives, superhuman efforts are being made every day. And while most of us couldn’t contemplate running a marathon or climbing Mount Everest, an inspirational band of Brits have managed these astonishing feats many times over, raising millions for good causes and smashing world records in the process. Their achievements are even more remarkable because they are battling their own obstacles, overcoming the limitations of their bodies and fighting off dark demons to reach for the stars. Today we celebrate the extraordinary efforts of these inspiring Brits and share their stories of amazing endeavours against all odds. aposI did this for my mum and Climbers Against Cancerapos Towering ft above Orkney, the Old Man of Hoy is a ­formidable challenge for even the most able of climbers. The needle-thin rock stack – one of the highest in Britain – is exposed to the elements and surrounded by the crashing waves of the Atlantic Ocean. But for eight-year-old Edward Mills, summoning up the courage to scale this natural wonder was nothing compared to the fight his mum Bekki was waging against breast cancer. The Gloucestershire schoolboy had been a keen climber since the age of two and came up with the idea for the charity challenge on a family holiday to Orkney. And in June , as his proud mum watched from a ferry, he made his incredible ascent, flanked by two coaches. It took Edward four-and-a-half hours to reach the top and become the youngest person to complete the climb. At the summit, he hid a small box with a metal card tucked inside that read: “I did this for my mum and Climbers Against Cancer.” Edward’s record-breaking climb raised £, for charity but most importantly, he made his terminally ill mum incredibly proud in her final days. Bekki passed away three months after Edward’s triumph, aged . Dad Nathan says: “It meant the world to her. “She was going to miss out on everything  in his le – his ­girlfriends, university, his first job – so this was ­something incredible she could be part of and witness.” Two weeks after Bekki died, Edward and big brother George, , also tragically lost their grandad.  Edward went on to win a Pride of Britain award after coming out on top in the Child of Courage category.While collecting his Good Morning Britain-backed award in , the ­youngster complained to then Prime Minister Theresa May about the standard of the loo at No.He told her: “I have a complaint. It’s so posh here I thought your toilet would be made of gold. But it isn’t.” Mrs May, suppressing a smile, replied: “I am sorry about that, Edward. I shall have a word with the Chancellor.” Marathon marvel can walk only using arms As she crossed the finishing line of the London Marathon, Claire Lomas was in last place. But her herculean -day effort to make it to the end made her the true winner of the race. The former top-level event rider was left paralysed from the chest down in a horse riding accident in May .  Doctors told her she would never walk again. But eight weeks later, determined not to take her fate lying down, Claire discharged herself and began rehab. She had to relearn everything, from making a cup of tea to getting dressed. And her courage reaped its rewards. She met husband Dan a year later, had daughter Maisie, and took up new sports such as skiing and handcycling – grateful to still have use of her arms. In April  she put on a pioneering ReWalk “bionic suit” to tackle the . mile marathon at no more than two miles a day. A year later came a -mile handcycle ride around Britain, then she did the Great North Run  in five days – pregnant with second daughter, Chloe. And the following year she finished the ten-mile Great South Run in  hours, her first non-stop endurance event. Claire, who is  next week, has so far raised more than £, for the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation. She says of the suit: “It doesn’t walk for me, I have to use the parts that aren’t paralysed to make it walk. It’s not just physical, it’s the concentration with every step.” Yet the Leicestershire mum insists: “It sounds strange, but the best days of my le came after the accident. So many amazing things have happened since that I never dwell on the negatives.” Gold medal and world record after rocks falls    A thirst for adventure was always in Karen Darke’s DNA – and a le-changing injury was not going to stop her. A keen fell runner, mountain biker and competitive rock climber from a young age, she scaled the Matterhorn using just a postcard to guide her. But in , aged , she fell  feet on to rocks while climbing a sea clf – breaking her skull, arms, neck and back. Yorkshire-born Karen woke from a coma to be told she had lost the use of her legs. She says: “I initially thought, ‘I’d rather be dead’. But I soon learned that with friends, creativity and perseverance, most things are possible.” When she left hospital after six months, the first thing she bought was a racechair. Geologist Karen, , became a top-level athlete, and was World Paratriathlon Champion in  and . She won silver at the  Paralympics for handcycling, and followed it up with a gold in Rio – despite being hit by a car during her training. She has handcycled ,km over the Himalayas, sitskied across Greenland and scaled Yosemite’s El Capitan, a four-day climb of , pull-ups. She also holds the women’s handcycle speed record at .mph – and still seeks out adventure. Karen says of her achievements: “Ability is a state of mind, not of body.” Ordeal fit for heroes  After the horrors of war, few challenges remain to truly test you. But Ibi Ali and Luke Wigman, both injured on the front line, found one – the World Marathon Challenge, tackling seven marathons in seven days on seven continents, in conditions from -C ice to C heat. Army captain Ibi won the Military Cross for bravery after continuing to lead his men despite losing part of his right arm and seven pints of blood in Iraq in , when a daisy-chain of linked bombs exploded. RAF paratrooper Luke suffered horric injuries to his left leg from an IED in Afghanistan in . They met at the Invictus Games, and their multi-marathon mission in January  raised £million for a state-of-the-art rehab centre near Loughborough for wounded troops. Luke averaged :: for each marathon, finishing third overall. Ibi, averaging ::, became the first amputee to complete the event. He said: “If we can help just one person through rehab, we’re happy.” Iaposll never give up dream as dancer    Never was a name more appropriate than Pollyanna Hope. After losing her right leg below the knee aged two, Pollyanna refused to let her dreams be dashed. Determined to be a ballerina, she fashioned a pointe shoe for her prosthetic leg from a plastic cup, letting her dance on tiptoe like every other dancer. Mum Sarah says: “She decided, despite what anyone said, she could do it.” Pollyanna, her mum and grandmother Elizabeth were hit by a bus at a bus stop in . She and Sarah suffered le-changing injuries. Elizabeth died. Now , she has had more than  operations, and has fought for her place in the world of ballet – even after losing marks in an exam for not pointing her non-existent foot. A national champion for Riding for the Disabled, she now uses a prosthetic blade she helped design, and has just beaten  able-bodied children to a place on a dance course. Sarah says: “She has drive. If she wants to be a dancer when she grows up, she will be a dancer.” Edwina: Irongran at  "},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles rude comment harry","story":"NewsPrince Charles rude comment to Harry and William exposed after microphone gaffeIt was  during a holiday in the Swiss Alps - days before his wedding to Camilla - that Prince Charles general frustration boiled over and he made a rather awkward comment to Harry and William after not spotting a nearby microphoneShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video prince-charles-rude-comment-harry-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news prince-charles-rude-comment-harry-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Prince Philip has previous chosen to say such choice ditties as “You managed not to get eaten then ” in conversation with a British trekker in Papua New Guinea in  and, famously, “If you stay here much longer, you’ll get slitty eyes, which he said to a British student in China in . Charles, meanwhile, was more coy when he let slip a famously rude comment - but perhaps did not expect to be caught out by the latest in sound recording tech. It was back in , at a photo session in Klosters ski resort in the Swiss Alps, when the Prince of Wales was asked about his upcoming wedding to Camilla. The eager reporter was one Nicholas Witchell, a seasoned operator who since  had been the BBCaposs royal correspondent. In , Witchell had been the first reporter to announce the death of Princess Diana, Charlesapos first we.And in  his obituary of Princess Margaret - the Queenaposs sister - caused some offence at the Palace for references to her lovers and copious consumption of whisky.For whatever reason, on that cold day in the Swiss Alps, Charles, surrounded as he and his two sons William and Harry were by TV cameras, microphones and journalists, let slip his true feelings about the BBC man. Witchell had asked how Charles was feeling about his upcoming nuptials - William having just answered a similar question. Somewhat cheekily, the Prince of Wales replies: Iaposm very glad you heard of it anyway, before his face contorts into an awkward, somewhat exasperated grin. But then, through gritted teeth, Charles mutters under his breath: Bloody people. I canapost bear that man. Heaposs so awful. He really is.  Whether or not he expected his comment to be picked up is open to debate, but thereaposs no doubting he could see the dozens of microphones honed on his every word. William, to his credit, remains composed despite his dadaposs muttered utterances and continues with a light-hearted response. As long as I donapost lose the rings. I have one responsibility and Iaposm bound to do something wrong, he jokes. William was to be a witness at the wedding the following week.The clip recently resurfaced on Channel aposs The Royals on Holiday programme.Ten years on from that day, Witchell and the Prince had an uncomfortable reunion.  The royal correspondent came face-to-face with the Prince of Wales at an environmental fundraiser in Washington DC in March . It was believed to be the first time the two had met since the heir to the throne was caught muttering his cutting aside. But the Prince seemed unrepentant when confronted by the reporter outside the event. He gave a curt reply when Witchell asked why he still cared so much about environmental issues.  Well, Iaposll turn it round the other way, responded Charles. I think youaposd be more surprisedI didnapost care about these things. But I think particularly in terms of what Iaposve been talking about now, thereaposs an awful lot to worry about. The Prince then quickly got into his car. Speaking in  about the incident, Witchell said: There has never been an apology, and why should there be  He was probably quite right. You know, awful man. You could take the view it was the best thing that happened to me, because it showed that it is our job as BBC journalists to report fairly and accurately, but not to seek approval. Weaposre not there to be liked.  Reports suggested that, back in , Charles had perhaps hoped the cameras would leave him and his sons alone for their weekaposs holiday while preparations for his wedding continued back home. Along with the comment about Witchell, Charles was also caught muttering, I hate doing this, and, Bloody people, as he smiled wryly. That day was also famous for an endearing interaction between Charles and his then-youthful sons. As the reporters bustled in their media huddle, Charles asked William and Harry: Do I put my arms around you   William replied: No, donapost, but you can take the horrible glasses away. Charles said: Do not be rude about my glasses, I couldnapost bear ityou were. A cheeky photographer then tells the Royal trio to look like you know each other, causing the princes to lean into their dad who puts his arms around his sons. Charles then said to his sons: What do we do   And William replied: Keep smiling, keep smiling. As the clip began circulating the globe - far more of a scoop than anything the hopeful hacks could have dreamed of bagging that day in the Alps - the Palace was quick to offer explanations to mitigate the impact. Pictures of Prince William sitting next to his then girlfriend and fellow St Andrews student Kate Middleton on a restaurant terrace the previous day had appeared in the press, and aides suggested the Prince was narked by this.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Congratulations to Tom, I think what heaposs done is utterly amazing, the duke said.

Itaposs not just what heaposs done, itaposs the reaction that people have had as well, I think is again just wonderfully British, he continued. Iaposm just so incredibly proud to see what these iniduals up and down the country and across the world are doing on a day-to-day basis. Itaposs also proving that I think things are better than weaposre led to believe through certain corners of the media. It can be very worrying when youaposre sitting there and the only information you are getting is from certain news channels, but thenyou are out and about or you are on the right s, you can really sense this human spirit coming to the forefront.The duke, who now lives in Los Angeles after he and we Meghan Markle officially gave up their royal duties last month, also thanked NHS workers and volunteers who have been working tirelessly to treat Covid- patients.I want to say a huge thank you, as we all do, to all of the NHS workers and everybody thataposs volunteering, he added. Because up and down the UK, whether itaposs from Dorset up to Staffordshire, there are literally hundreds of thousands of people volunteering. Harry added that he hopes Brits will continue volunteering once the crisis ends. It just makes me incredibly proud to see the Brits stepping up like this, but I really, really hope that this keeps going after coronavirus and after this whole pandemic has come to a close. Itaposs about selflessness rather than selfishness and I think in todayaposs culture, in todayaposs world, we need more role models that are willing to put others ahead of themselves. Reflecting on his time in the army, he said: I think again about being part of a unit, being part of a team, certainly for me wearing a unorm that was the same as everybody . It kind of makes you feel totally equal but at the same time makes you want to do everything you can for the person on your left and the person on your right.

It comes just a day after police chiefs issued new guidance on what counts as a “reasonable excuse” for the public to leave their homes. And while they permitted the purchase of essential tools and supplies to say, repair a fence damaged by bad weather, they said it was not reasonable to pop out for DIY supplies so you can do up your kitchen, for example. But that seemed to go over the heads of some, who were spotted today at The Range in Plymouth with ious items that are likely to fall into the non-essential category. Two shoppers were seen exiting the story with large grow bags and some other planting materials, although one of them was wearing a mask and gloves. Another couple was seen with a wheelie basket filled with potted plants. Bizarrely, one man had even been into the shop to purchase a drone, while another woman had a trolley piled high with soft furnishings. It comes after more than , fines were handed out to people considered to be flouting the rules in England between March  ad April .  During the lockdown – which has now been extended to May  - Brits have been asked to go out just once per day to exercise or buy essential goods. Now police have said needing to cool off from an argument, buying alcohol, taking your pet to the vet or having a rest while out for a walk all count as reasons to be outside the home. The list was issued by the National Police Chiefaposs Council and College of Policingand also says buying food to last several days, including luxury items and alcohol, is also a valid excuse."},{"url":null,"title":"two minutes meghan markles royal","story":"NewsTwo minutes of Meghan Markles royal le that were turning point ahead of quitMeghan Markle and Prince Harry announced they were quitting the royal family in January, but they said they spent months considering their le-changing decision before thatShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghan-harry-dance-kick-south-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news two-minutes-meghan-markles-royal-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

After just two years she decided to turn her back on the spotlight and along with husband Prince Harry stepped back from her duties. Many experts have tried to pinpoint the moment the couple decided enough was enough, but one believes there was one engagement in particular that was a real turning point. Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, thinks we saw a new side of the royal couple on the first day of their South Africa tour. Shortly before they left a township in Cape Town, the couple were stopped by a group of performers and started dancing with them, and the casual, fun moment became a tour highlight. Speaking on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: She was dancing with the children and it was such a stark contrast to some of the events we had seen before her pregnancy. Sheaposs in this very affordable dress, sheaposs in affordable wedges, her hair is in a ponytail, sheaposs dancing with children. We didnapost know then what we know now but I think that moment and that look was a turning point in their roles, in that they werenapost going to be these high glamour royals any more. They wanted to be more down to earth, with the people, dancing with the children, getting out with the crowds.  Meghan wore a stunning black and white wrap dress by Mayamiko for a visit to a organisation that promotes female empowerment in Cape Town. The £ patterned dress was from Mayamiko, a sustainable Malawi brand. Christine said: I love that wrap dress because itaposs not a royal colour. Meghan does wear bright colours but her signature style and her personal style is more monotonatic - its black, itaposs white, itaposs grey, itaposs deep navy.  This was still her signature colour pallet - she looked so incredibly beautul, she was still showing a very normal post-postum body which so many women around the world appreciated and that outfit to me, especially as it marked the beginning of the tour, was a turning point with her relationship with her role as a duchess. Meghan and Harry shocked fans around the world when they announced their decision to step down in January.

Hospital admissions are beginning to plateau. There are hopes of a vaccine as early as September. Our unity of purpose in defeating this invader remains undimmed – from the collective Thursday turnout to applaud heroic key workers to inidual acts of kindness in delivering supplies to the vulnerable. And Captain Tom Moore’s herculean effort to raise more than £million for the NHS is breathtaking. We all salute you, sir. It is too early to say whether we are witnessing the beginning of the end of this war. But at least we are at the end of the beginning. We are winning the Battle of Britain but there is still a way to go before D-Day. On the NHS frontline and in care homes where the struggle is at its most ferocious, the picture is not so rosy. Personal protection for doctors, nurses and care workers was in short supply when this crisis began and supplies are getting shorter. A nurse tells us she must break safety rules by reusing syringes because they are running out. There is not enough testing to protect them and those they look after. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s target of , tests a day seems more dream than imminent scenario. First Secretary Dominic Raab outlines ­conditions to be met before lockdown can be lted. But in terms too vague to be meaningful. The British people are grown-ups. They can be trusted with the truth. And he should tell it like it is, eventhat truth is further restrictions. We are told at each No press conference that the Government will follow the scientic advice. But that too is sometimes contradictory. There was the dangerous fallacy of creating herd immunity until it dawned how many lives that would cost. We were told that face masks were useless and then that they might yet prove useful. We were told to use paracetamol and not ibuprofenwe succumbed to the disease, and then that ibuprofen might be all right after all.  Which shows that while scientists may know more, they do not always know best. They can flounder in the dark just like the politicians. We do not blame them for that. This is a new virus yet to be understood which acts with unpredictable consequences. Fighting it means making much of it up as we go along.

The US mum of eighteen kids, some of whom are adopted, said she only began feeling really unwell later into the illness.When the virus finally hit her - it hit hard, she told local ABC news affiliate WHAM.Seventeen of her children live with her at home. Ms Jencik said unknowingly contracted the virus around five weeks ago without realising it at first. It was like a freight train, she said. It was terrying. I was a little ahead of them in the timing of it all. I was as afraid of my le as I had ever been, and not much scares me.” She said her family has been self-isolating for the past month and called in a friend for help to professionally clean her home, worrying the virus could linger on surfaces. The cleaner went in wearing hazmat and gasmasks to clean the home for two hours while the family waited outdoors. Research has been unclear in the early stages on whether the virus can strike the same victim twice.There is some hope people become immune after contracting Covid-, but scientists are still working to understand the novel coronavirus.Ms Jencik said having the home cleaned was a no-brainer.  She said: “I needed to know from my mama heart that I was protecting the people I love to the best extent I possibly could. The US has become the world epicentre of the deadly pandemic. New York state, where the Jencik family lives, has led the states in coronavirus infections. The United States has by far the worldaposs largest number of cases with more than , and some , deaths.

The outgoing royals sported colour-coordinated blue bandannas over their faces to protect against coronavirus as they walked two dogs in the city they now call home. The couple had settled in Canada in a £million Vancouver Island bolthole after their split from the royal family. But they relocated to Calornia as the coronavirus outbreak began to spread around the world to Meghanaposs hometown, nearer her mother Doria Ragland. Meghan can be seen carrying a bottle of hand sanitiser as she and Harry walked with beagle, Guy, and black labrador, Oz, and took a hike up a steep, tree-line path.  Both wore face coverings in line with new Calornian regulations as the US battles the pandemic during the outing on Thursday. At one point the beagle appeared to become so overwhelmed in the sunshine cityaposs heat, Meghan had to pick up the pup and carry it. The couple left Archie at home as they took an outing at a hilly local path. Harry, , sported a baseball cap, sunglasses, a t-shirt and Meghan, , was dressed casually in a tee, white trousers and trainers, carrying her iPhone with a gold case and also wearing shades and a cap.They both used blue bandannas to comply with new Calornia regulations on face coverings to combat the spread of coronavirus. A source told The Sun : “Harry and Meghan seemed in very good spirits and the dogs were clearly over the moon to be out and about. “They were hiking for over an hour and when they got back to the car the dogs looked exhausted.  “Meghan even had to carry the beagle back because he was so worn out from the heat. There was one security guard with them during the hike. The pair packed their dogs into the boot of a silver Kia car before heading home. The coupleaposs outing came just hours after Meghan and Harry delivered free meals in West Hollywood for charity Project Angel Food.

Daniel, who has HIV, said he did no recognise his visitors at first. “My phone rang, and a lady said, ‘Hi, this is Meghan from Project Angel Food.” “I said, ‘Oh, do you want to meet me downstairs ’ - I didn’t realise it was THE Meghan at this point.’Daniel said he spotted two black-out SUVs on the road outside and realised this was no ordinary visitor. “I knew they was something going on.” As he approached the front door, Daniel said he spotted a familiar face. “I recognised Harry first because I saw his red hair, but he didn’t say anything,” said Daniel. “Then I looked at Meghan and put it all together.

An expert has now told Health that having persistently bloodshot eyes could be a warning sign that someone has been infected.Bloodshot eyes could indicate conjunctivitis, which is caused by an infection or allergies.More research is needed to establish a link between coronavirus and conjunctivitis, a condition which can be caused by a number of factors, but one doctor has said the virus can affect the conjunctiva in the eyes.Conjunctivitis, also known as red or pink eye, usually affects both eyes and causes them to be bloodshot, burn or feel gritty, produce pus that sticks to lashes, itch and water. Dr Vicente Diaz, a Yale Medicine ophthalmologist, told Health: Many viral illnesses can affect the eye, typically causing a follicular type of conjunctivitis. We are learning that COVID- can affect the conjunctiva in a low percentage of people. The theory was backed up by a number of other studies citied by Health. The American Academy of Ophthalmology said that conjunctivitis aposmay be an uncommon but still present symptom of Covid-apos, and that it is import to remember that it can also be caused by allergies, which is aposmuch more likely to be the causeapos in the current season.

Lionel Vytialingam was buying food when he heard car horns and saw a small terried dog weaving in and out of traffic in Ipoh, Malaysia.

Lionel saw the dog had a soggy note attached to its collar with a rubber band, but didnapost try to retrieve it until he had gained its trust. After about  minutes, the dog plucked up the courage to approach him and Lionel carefully removed the note, while holding on to her apossticky knots of furapos, hoping it contained the owneraposs contact details or an address.

The note left Lionel in tears and he decided to take the poor pup home, where he fed and bathed her, dried her off and let her sleep in a cosy bed he created under the safety of his sofa. His previously adopted dog Sammo didnapost get along with Siggy, so Lionelaposs brother is taking care of him while Lionel and Siggy stay in temporary accomodation. Lionel said: She had formed the most intense, most pleading eye contact with me from under her matted fringe. I unhooked the note, opened it up and read it right there crouched by the roadside.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This was a highly unusual end to the season, to say the least, and not the one any of us would have preferred, but all three deserve enormous credit for their performances over the course of the season.“With the turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Covid- outbreak, there was always going to be a highly-charged and passionate debate about how we secure the future of Scottish football.“It is no exaggeration to say that this was an existential matter for Scottish clubs, with many of them telling us they were at real risk of going under unless the situation was resolved very quickly, so I’m pleased that the game has moved decisively.“Whilst more than % of clubs agreed with the directors’ written resolution, it’s clear that others were strongly opposed.“There has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward and I now call on all  clubs to move forward in a constructive and positive way.”SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster also had his say on tonight’s development.He said: “Prior to this positive result, we were unable to make the vital end-of-season payments, which will provide a leline to so many clubs in the lower isions. From our detailed discussions with clubs, many were facing an enormous cash-flow crisis. We have moved as quickly as possible to try to resolve this unprecedented situation.“We’ve achieved the % agreement threshold in the Ladbrokes Premiership, Championship and Leagues  and  and will now be working as quickly as we can to get the end-of-season payments to members in the three lower isions by the end of this week.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

dundee fans want answers from john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed and they can work on survival plans for their clubs.“It is time now toour focus on staying safe and planning for the future of Dundee FC.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs we have highlighted in the paper over the past few weeks, the response of the public in the coronavirus crisis has been superb.People generally have abided by government advice to stay at home.

A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water. As before, the flames fizzed for a moment but it made no dference.Just then a hare ran by and saw what the squirrel was doing.ldquoYou foolish animal, said the hare, ldquoyou canrsquot put the fire out by yourself.The squirrel looked at the hare and nodded.ldquoI know she said, ldquobut the forest is my home so Irsquom doing what I can do.Then she asked the hare, ldquoWill you help me The hare thought for a moment. He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears.

The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site.

And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it.

After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable.

Even with thoughts of lugging heavy panniers full of day-to-day necessary detritus.Even knowing Id have to scrap with private hire drivers at junctions and dodge buses in cycle lanes.Thats a large part of the current joy. No scrapping, no narrow misses, no stress.The roads are so much emptier that the nagging fear always following at my shoulder, that heightened sense of potential doom, is gone.There are streets so quiet on my route that you can almost forget about motorised traffic and freewheel, carefree up the middle of the road. It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

A death begets a byelection. Crises, however grim, can be opportunities.So it was quite a surprise to see the SNP come over all prim and prissy this week about discussing independence in relation to the coronavirus.The prompt was Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw joining the dots between the two as he looked ahead to the  Holyrood election.ldquoI think it will look ridiculousthe first debate that the Nationalist movement want to have when we get to the other side of this is lsquoLetrsquos go gung ho for independence next yearrsquo, then more fool themthey do, he told the PA news agency.ldquoI think the public will look at that and say lsquoAre you kidding rsquoHe then twisted the dirk by observing Scotland was being helped through the outbreak by the UKrsquos ldquoeconomic resilience and strength.The SNPrsquos reaction to this was to try to shut down the debate entirely, a sure sign Mr Carlaw had drawn blood.ldquoThe last thing any Scottish politician on any side of the constitutional debate should be doing is trying to use the appalling crisis we all currently face as an argument for or against independence, the party gasped.Obviously, therersquos a calculation to be made about how far to venture into regular politics during the pandemic.The public has lost much of its appetite for the previous argy-bargy.But for the party of independence to echo Theresa May and say now is not the time to argue for its cause at all Well, that was a moment.Becauseever there was a time for the SNP to talk about independence - at least to itself - it is surely right now.Its previous case for leaving the UK, of a healthier economy creating a fairer society, is being dismantled by Covid-. Not speaking up would be a dereliction of the partyrsquos mission.The First Minister, as the tireless face of Scotlandrsquos response to the emergency, is an understandable exception. But for the Yes movementrsquos sake, she cannot be the rule.SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil had the right idea. He simply ignored the injunction from party HQ and tweeted that it was good Mr Carlaw brought up independence, as it let the SNP government mention it too and ldquohighlight that dealing with your own problems unfettered... is better.Regardless of whether you agree with his point, it made perfect sense for Mr MacNeil to make it, to keep saying what he believes in, and not cede the floor to his opponents.He could see Mr Carlaw wasnrsquot squeamish about a Unionist argument based on Covid-. That reference to the UKrsquos economic resilience and strength was a straw in the wind.Come the  election, the Tories, Labour and LibDems will be arguing that the Union, far from being an abstract anachronism, proved its worth in this crisis. That when it really mattered, Westminster broke the emergency glass at the Treasury and hosed the country with money. That the insurance policy paid out.: Mark Smith: A message for nationalists: do not make the virus about Scotland versus England ndash it demeans youPeople will of course argue over the many failings, about testing, PPE and the threadbare state of the NHS and the welfare state going into this.But the key message from the Unionist side, like it or loathe it, will be that the four-nations of the UK pulled together and got things done.And while there were regional tweaks, Scotland was a core part and beneficiary of that collective effort. Go ask its Nationalist First Minister.That argument is what the Yes movement, with its garlands of rosy hypotheticals, now has to overcome.It must rethink its own arguments - not its beliefs, but its messages to the unpersuaded - and it needs to get a sht on. Above all, it needs to say how a fledgling state can take off in the worst recession in a century.For what goes into the next white paper on independence now It was supposed to be rooted in Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission, the SNPrsquos economic blueprint for a new Scotland.Itrsquos not Mr Wilsonrsquos fault he didnrsquot factor in a pandemic. But it has made much of his work redundant.Its research on how small countries can prosper is salvageable. But his calculations for the first decade of independence - based on long-term growth of .%, halving a deficit of %, keeping debt below % of GDP - look like bygones of a dferent era.As the report said, persuading No voters about the economics of independence will need ldquoclear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.But as wersquove learned, no plan survives contact with coronavirus, and economic plans least of all.That particular pillar of the SNPrsquos case has now crumbled. The longer the crisis goes on, the more pages in the old prospectus will turn blank.The one thing that could yet change the dynamic is Brexit. If the UK government refuses to extend trade talks with the EU in light of coronavirus and brings about a hard lurch to WTO terms in the depths of a recession, it will squander any credit it is accumulating at present, and remind a lot of Scottish voters why they wanted to wave Westminster goodbye.:Scottish independence support maintains lead in latest pollHowever the current refusal to change course probably owes more to the absence of the only Tory who can sell an extension to Leave voters than dogmatism. Only once the Prime Minister s from convalescence can a pragmatic position prevail.Eventhe PM sticks to his original mad timetable, Ms Sturgeon cannot rely on it tipping the case for independence. She needs a new pitch as well.Her announcement yesterday of an economic recovery advisory group acknowledged that. Despite insisting she has no time for party politics right now, she said the new group would plan how to build a ldquofairer, greener and more equal society after Covid-, a clear nod to independence.It will be instructive to see how many politicians she sprinkles among the economists and business leaders to help steer it in that direction.God knows, she needs something to go right for her cause just now.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

I am determined to keep the pressure up on booking and protect my constituents.\":Coronavirus in Scotland: Ian Blackford calls for all Highland accommodation to close in bid to stop spread of COVID-All political parties have expressed concern over people attempting to escape cities and towns to rural and isolated parts of Scotland, in a bid to evade contracting the virus. But the behaviour results in too many people arriving in locations that have less resources to deal with an increase in patients, who need specialist and often intensive care facilities.Scottish communities angrily reacted to the influx in visitors - some resorting to barricading lay-bys and would-be camping areas - warning that their already-under pressure local health services cannot cope with the extra strain.Last month, a military aircraft was needed to transport a critically-ill coronavirus patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.This led to the Scottish Government announcing that ferries services were now to only be used for islanders, allowing them to continue essential journeys.Even before the official lockdown was put in place, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told accommodation providers to stop accepting bookings - a message reiterated ahead of what would have been the Easter holidays.A Scottish Government spokesperson, said: ldquoWe need everyone to stay at home to help us save lives and protect our NHS.\"We also need businesses to help us achieve this. Travel companies are expected to act responsibly and not take any holiday bookings. Failure to comply with this puts people at risk.The public has repeatedly been told to stay at home unless shopping for essential food and medicines, work which cannot be completed at home and once a day for a session of outdoors exercise.

Again. Irsquom lying in bed, have been for half an hour, trying to beat back the fragments of thoughts, the noisy nonsense of insomnia, breathing in and out, my brain churning through indefinable problems which probably donrsquot even really exist, until finally, I admit defeat, walk downstairs, make myself a cup of caffeine-free tea and try to work. My only company is the birdsong ndash and, perhaps, you. Because I know, during this lockdown and pandemic, there are others out there, somewhere in this city, somewhere in the land, somewhere on Twitter. This is lockdown. Days and nights donrsquot work like they used to.They neither work for those of us trapped in our homes in quarantine, nor for those on the frontline. One study found that one-third of healthcare workers suffered insomnia during the Covid- epidemic in China. Those reporting sleeplessness were also more likely to feel depressed, anxious, and have stress-based trauma. I canrsquot help feeling my own sleep struggles are nothing compared with the torment of being unable to drop off while also knowing you have to go, exhausted, into a hospital the next day, to do your work of trying to save lives, perhaps with equipment that is inadequate.But all of us listen to the news. All of us have heard the stories about the extension of lockdown, the impact on the economy, the rising figures in intensive care, the elderly dying in care homes. Almost all of us have lost the routines that kept us rooted. Almost all of us are worrying about something or somebody. We are all in touch with the collective trauma of this pandemic.Sleep expert Dr Donn Posner, speaking at a Hard TH Chan School of Public Health online forum, recently described the current pandemic, with its lockdown conditions, as a ldquoperfect storm of sleep problems. He observed: ldquoThe actions that wersquore taking to protect ourselves can not only precipitate problems with sleep, but lead to chronic problems with sleep.We probably all know the common advice on whatrsquos called better sleep hygiene ndash donrsquot drink caffeine after lunchtime, avoid too much alcohol, do plenty of exercise, turn off your screens in the evening, create a bedtime routine, meditate, aim for around seven hours sleep, avoid daytime napping. Yet that advice doesnrsquot seem quite adequate for these times of fear and social distancing. Our bodies are bound to react to the combination of being cooped up and under the kind of stress that triggers the fight-or-flight response. One clinical psychologist, Lucy Johnstone, interviewed by Wired last week, noted: ldquoI think itrsquos important not to medicalise our responses, whether emotional or physical, and of course these are intertwined. Personally, I would be more concerned about someone who is not feeling alarmed by the threats we are facing.In my view, worse than insomnia is worrying about insomnia. Even sleep experts like Posner advise not trying to force ityou canrsquot sleep. ldquoGood sleepers, he says, ldquoput no effort into sleep whatsoever. Thats why Im up and working. That and the fact that I do think there may be a place for working our fears out during the night. Waking in the early hours may simply be a natural response to what wersquore collectively going through.LETHARGYJust as the nights are wakeful, so are the days slumpy. Itrsquos the middle of the afternoon, the kids are under their duvets, and I wonder where my husband has disappeared off to, only to find he is there in bed reading some council report. I ask himhersquos okay, loading the word ldquookay in that way that makes it a shorthand for, ldquoHave you got a persistent dry cough, headache, loss of taste or fever  He nods to say hersquos fine ndash too much effort to properly reply.I try to read a book on the sofa and find myself swamped by the kind of woozy tiredness I havenrsquot felt since pregnancy. Soon Irsquom looking up ldquolethargy and the virus\" ndash its my symptoms search of the hour. Unsurprisingly, tiredness is associated with the illness. But, says the internet, lethargy is also a symptom of the cabin fever all of us are getting during lockdown, and the best antidote to it is moving around.I tell the children: ldquoItrsquos not true that wersquore too tired to exercise ndash the only thing that will give us energy is exercise. No-one moves. The idea of getting them out the house wearies me.So I slump back onto the sofa and look up ldquoweariness and the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-praise-thanks-volunteers-hailed-lifelines-lockdown","story":"For some people who find themselves in isolation, these amazing volunteers have become lelines.

It breaks up your day as you see someone twice a day when they drop off lunch and tea. I really appreciate everything they are doing. They even dropped off some bread and toilet rolls one week. It was such a great idea and they have managed to keep it all going so well.\"Gavin Price, who runs The Fountain bar in Aberfeldy, Perthshire, and is also the boss of Scottish Professional Football League Two side Elgin City, didnrsquot know what he and his staff were going to do when they had to close their doors. Originally they thought they could hand out the surplus stock they had and made a few meals. That idea has now grown into a community concern involving dozens of volunteers and have delivered more than  meals since they started for people who are in isolation.Mr Price said: \"Our funding team are relentless and we have been supported by grants and local businesses.

We have one person turning  next week and we will try to make it as special as we can.\"Volunteer Ms Redford added: \"Even before we were heading for lockdown I put up posters in coffee shops in the town. It simply askedanyone needed shopping done to give me a call. I started out putting leaflets through doors so people could let us know what kind of help they needed from shopping to picking up prescriptions.\"I printed up a couple of thousand help cards to post through doors and thanks to volunteers we were able to reach  homes. I also put together a business directory and delivered  of those to peoplersquos homes. It meant people who were isolating had contact numbers they needed and might be glad of some of the local firms delivering.ldquoI do two to three shops a day for people and with more than  helpers now on board we are able to get to a number of people.

It has already been wonderful for me. I canrsquot thank them enough for what they do for me, said Mrs Gibbs. ldquoI am no longer able to get out and online shopping is not an option for me as my eyesight is poor.ldquoNothing is too much trouble for them. I phone up with my weekly orders and you feel asyou have a friend at the other end. The service they provide is even more important given the circumstances we now find ourselves in. To know that your shopping will be brought to your door is such a relief.Mrs Gibbs says the volunteers are taking great care when they bring her shopping.She added: ldquoEveryone is taking greater health and safety. The volunteer lets me know when they are on their way. When they arrive I make sure I have enough time to move to another room. I have had a number of challenges in my le and have learned to adapt. I am also content with my own company and can fill my days with interests, but for some people finding themselves in isolation must be very dficult and I feel for them.The Food Train was set up in  and has been making daily le easier for older people, providing vital services to those who are no longer able to manage independently, through age, ill health, frailty or disability. It makes hundreds of grocery deliveries every week, ensuring those most in need have access to fresh groceries. And during this crisis it has been a godsend for many.Emma Black, fundraising and marketing manager at the Food Chain, which has sites across Scotland, said they have had more than  volunteers sign up to help in Glasgow since Covid- outbreak.She said: ldquoWith new customers coming on board we are now reaching nearly  vulnerable older people across Glasgow but these numbers are increasing daily.ldquoDue to the increase in customer numbers we are introducing our brand new : shopping service, whereby we match volunteers up with a vulnerable older person to shop for them specically.As their fundraising activity has gone down and our costs have gone up particularly in staffing, personal protection equipment and fuel, they have set up a Just Giving page https:www.justgiving campaign FoodTrainIan Arthur is one of the newest recruits and volunteered at the beginning of the crisis.ldquoI had been taking shopping to my mother-in-law and leaving it on the doorstep and I thought there must be many more people in Glasgow in this similar situation where they canrsquot get out but might not have the help there, said Mr Arthur.ldquoI searched online for groups online in my area and the Food Train came up.

Writer at Large Neil Mackay reportsITrsquoS just over a year since the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, when  people were shot dead at a mosque and Islamic centre ndash the killings live-streamed online.What marked the atrocity out as dferent from other white supremacist attacks, was that a manesto believed to have been connected to the gunman spoke of the acts being inspired by \"eco-fascism\". The manesto talks of environmentalism and population growth. It states that: ldquoContinued immigration into Europe is environmental warfare.Christchurch, however, wouldnrsquot be the last time that far-right violence intersected with the environment. Four-and-a-half months after Christchurch, on August , , a gunman shot and killed  people in El Paso, Texas. The killings were the deadliest attack on Americarsquos Latino community in history. A manesto, which police believe is connected to the alleged gunman, said the El Paso killings were inspired by what happened in Christchurch and motivated by ldquothe Hispanic invasion of Texas.The El Paso manesto is called \"An Inconvenient Truth\" ndash mirroring the title of Al Gorersquos  documentary on the threat of climate change. In the manesto, the writer says the people of America are ldquotoo stubborn to change their lestyles ldquoso the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using its resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of le can become more sustainable.The writer also talks of oil, agriculture, and recycling the destruction of the environment and the impact of environmental degradation on future generations. ldquoOur lestyle is destroying the environment of our country, the manesto reads. ldquoThe decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations. Corporations are heading the destruction of our environment by shamelessly over-harvesting resources.One man has pleaded guilty to the Christchurch killings, and one man is awaiting trial for the attack in El Paso.Are these shootings the canary in the coal-mine, however  Are they warning us that the most extreme elements of the far-right are starting to co-opt environmentalism  Once the coronavirus pandemic is over, who knows how politics will realign and ideology sht and change.With climate change denial now recognised widely as an untenable scientic position, some extremists have latched on to environmental concerns, added them to racism and anti-immigration beliefs, and created a curdled form of eco-fascism.Professor Gary LaFree, from the University of Maryland and a former director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, has studied the role of environmentalism for a new breed of far-right extremists.ldquoTheyrsquore building an ideology, he says, adding: ldquoYou notice theyrsquore referring to each other hellip which to me makes it scarier. Itrsquos more like a social movement.Academic, activist and author Naomi Kleinrsquos new book, On Fire: TheCase For A Green New Deal, warns of the growth of eco-fascism. Klein has been called ldquothe intellectual godmother of the Green New Deal Movement. The Green New Deal envisages a greening of the economy, and reforms creating a fairer job market.Klein says: ldquoMy fear is that, unless something signicant changes in how our societies rise to the ecological crisis, we are going to see this kind of white power eco-fascism emerge with much greater frequency, as a ferocious rationalisation for refusing to live up to our collective climate responsibilities.At the heart of the problem is this: whattodayrsquos idealistic climate campaigners fail to change things  Whatactivists like Greta Thunberg donrsquot succeed in making governments act for the good of the world  Could environmentalism then be hijacked by the far right As the climate deteriorates, and governments fail to act, the far-right is already starting to seek to exploit public fears and discontent. There has long been academic theorising that in order to fix an almost insurmountable problem like climate change, society might find itself turning to some form of authoritarian \"strongman\" party or government, as liberal democracy may be too weak to take the measures required.Professor Michael E Zimmerman, a philosopher and environmental historian, describes eco-fascism as \"a totalitarian government that requires iniduals to sacrice their interests to the well-being of the lsquolandrsquo .It is easy to see how the far-right could manipulate environmental issues and pit them against immigration. So far, the far-right has been pretty much in the climate denial camp ndash but it looks asthatrsquos starting to change. In France, Marine Le Pen, leader of National Rallyndash until recently the National Front ndash has started to go green. France and Europe, says Le Pen, should be the worldrsquos ldquofirst ecological civilisation.One prominent member of RN, Jordan Bardella, said that ldquoborders are the environmentrsquos greatest ally itrsquos through them that we will save the planet.Le Pen has said the inidual is ldquonot simply a consumer or producer but ldquosomeone rooted, someone who wants to live on their land and pass it on to their children. She says someone ldquowho is rooted in their home is an ecologist and that those who are ldquonomadic hellip donrsquot care about the environment they have no homeland.The French thinker Jean-Yves Camus, who specialises in the extreme right, says environmentalism has ldquobecome part of the RNrsquos political agenda, but itrsquos a specically far-right form of environmentalism ndash very identitarian.Camus believes many far-right voters ldquosee society as like a biological organism that should be kept in its original state. According to this line of thinking, when a foreign body is introduced, it causes disorder ndash hence the anti-immigration stance. Logically, the same goes for nature: we must respect the natural order.The hardline Alternative for Germany Party has also seen an environmental sht. The youth wing of Germanyrsquos anti-immigrant party has been urging its leaders to drop climate denial.Naomi Klein says: ldquoThere is rage out there that is going to go somewhere, and we have demagogues who are expert at directing rage at the most vulnerable among us while protecting the most powerful and most culpable.Perhaps one of the biggest potential recruiting sergeants for the far-right when it comes to the environment would be any greening of industry which hurts rather than helps ordinary workers. Extremists could step in and say that they are the ones who can offer ecology and protect the poor.Already, therersquos widespread suspicion across the west that some environmental policies have done more for big business and the middle classes than either the planet or the poorest. The Yellow Vest protests in France were triggered after a backlash against green taxes which were seen to hurt the worse off in society.Josep Borrell, the EUrsquos new foreign policy chief, was recently attacked for comments he made about young climate activists. He said: ldquoI would like to knowyoung people demonstrating in Berlin hellip are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, becausewe fight against climate change for real they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidised.Borrell may have offended supporters of Greta Thunberg, but there is a genuine risk thatany Green New Deal is executed in a way which isnrsquot socially fair, this would be a fatal error easy to exploit by a far-right movement thatrsquos starting to embrace environmentalism.The concerns about Polish miners are on point. Poland is heavily dependent on coal, and Warsaw has refused to sign up to the EUrsquos  climate targets, which would lead to coal mining being phased out.There are complaints in Romania that plans to reskill miners have benefited decarbonisation firms rather than workers. Firms are making money from the \"reskilling\" market, but jobs and investment in new sectors havenrsquot appeared.Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, one of the worldrsquos largest asset management companies, has said that because of decarbonisation ldquowe are on the edge of fundamentally reshaping finance. Could the creation of a post-pandemic green economy benefit the rich, not the poor ldquoThe danger is that the public money hellip put into greening the European economy will instead merely subsidise greenwashing, says Daniela Gabor, professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol.In other words, taxes pay for big business to show off green credentials. Meanwhile, jobs are lost, no new jobs are created, and the planet isnrsquot helped.Itrsquos a recipe for public cynicism, and risks a popular rejection of mainstream political attempts to fix the climate crisis.Labourrsquos Keir Starmer has warned that any Green New Deal must ldquomean good jobs in new green industries. Starmer says we need to recognise that ldquothe poorest bear the least responsibility and the heaviest burden of climate breakdown.The development of eco-fascism also coincides with the growing crisis for democracy in the western world. Dissatisfaction with democracy is at a record high, particularly in Britain and America. One study by the University of Cambridge found that % of those questioned were dissatisfied with democracy.ldquoAcross the globe, democracy is in a state of malaise, said the reportrsquos author, Roberto Foa. Ominously, the economic crash and the refugee crisis are both seen as contributing to dissatisfaction with democracy. Now coronavirus has arrived as a new peril.The study suggests that the rise of populism is not a cause of dissatisfaction but a symptom.In the UK, for example, satisfaction with democracy rose steadily from the s for some  years ndash peaking just after the millennium.At the same time as the appeal of democracy waned, fears over the climate rose sharply. Developed and industrialised nations are feeling the effects of climate change now, with floods and fires, droughts and other wild weather.The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, says the world is ldquoway off track when it comes to dealing with the climate emergency, and time is running out.The UNrsquos assessment of global climate found that  was a record-breaking year for heat. More people are also on the move due to extreme temperatures and flooding. Once again, the connection between the environment and migration is there waiting for the far-right to step in and exploit it.In , the worldrsquos oceans were the warmest on record, with at least % of seas experiencing a heatwave. Surface air temperatures were the hottest ever recorded. For the nd year in a row, more ice was lost from glaciers than gained ndash this caused sea levels to go up to their highest since records began.Before the postponement of the UN climate summit in Glasgow due to coronavirus, Guterres was setting some hope on Scotland. ldquoWe need more ambition on [emission cuts], adaption and finance in time for the climate conference, COP, in Glasgow, UK, in November, he said, prior to the lockdown. ldquoThat is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.COP stands for the th Conference of the Parties ndash the UNrsquos Climate Change Conference. When the conference was held in France in  it adopted the Paris Agreement and signalled a step-change in how the world looked at the climate crisis, with nearly  nations agreeing ambitious goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit temperature rises.The Glasgow climate conference is now delayed until , but calls remain for it to kickstart a new green tech revolution. Researchers at Oxford University, led by Mike Mason of the School of Enterprise and the Environment, believe harnessing new technology could reduce carbon emissions by at least one billion tonnes a year.Examples of new green technology include converting cheap renewable energy ndash from wind, sun or wave ndash into zero-carbon fuel.But any Green New Deal needs to work for people as well as the planet. Unless ordinary workers are brought along, with new jobs and decent wages, then the fracture point between the economy and ecology will be a gt to extremists.Too often green measures are seen as hurting the poorest. A ban in England on the sale of wet wood and coal for domestic fireplaces, for example, was criticised for pushing people in rural areas into poverty.For Naomi Klein the rise of eco-fascism means that while therersquos a growing tendency among far-right extremists to no longer deny climate change, what they will continue to deny is any common humanity between people across the world.A far-right vision of environmentalism will be Darwinian, a brutal case of \"us versus them\", of pulling up the drawbridge. If we donrsquot act quickly and intelligently, then race and immigration could soon come to contaminate the debate about the environment.ldquoLet there be no mistake, says Klein. ldquoThis is the dawn of climate barbarism. And unless there is a radical change not only in politics but in the underlying values that govern our politics, this is how the wealthy world is going to lsquoadaptrsquo to more climate disruption: by fully unleashing the toxic ideologies that rank the relative value of human lives in order to justy the monstrous discarding of huge swathes of humanity.Klein wants to douse the flames of eco-fascism. The way to do that is to create well-paid, secure jobs for anyone whose livelihood is put at risk by the turn away from fossil fuels ndash and for the state to take on the burden of retraining workers of all ages. Thatrsquos the real Green New Deal. Thatrsquos the way to kill off eco-fascism while itrsquos still in its cradle.THE DEEP ROOTS OF ECO-FASCISMThe far-rightrsquos move to embrace the environment as part of its ideological agenda is nothing new. Itrsquos just been dormant for a long time.As with much of modern fascism, its roots lie in Nazi Germany. Nazi ideology hinged around the concept of \"Blood and Soil\" ndash the idea that Aryans had a mystical connection to their nation and a duty to protect the land.There was an almost romantic obsession with rural le in Nazi Germany, and it was seen as superior to urban living. Many Hitler Youth were sent to work on farms as ldquoonly those of German blood may be farmers.The Blood and Soil ideology found its most perverse outlet in the shape of both Nazi eugenics and lebensraum, the idea that German people should expand into lands once owned by their German ancestors. Nazi art and film also gloried nature.The first eco-terrorist was neither right nor left. Ted Kaczynski, otherwise known as the Unabomber, was a former mathematics professor who left society and his career to live off grid in the wilds of Montana.He saw himself as a revolutionary destined to overthrow ldquothe system and despised technology. Between  and , he killed three people and injured  others in a series of bomb attacks across the USA against universities, airlines and other industrial targets. Kaczynski even tried to bring down a passenger jet.Like todayrsquos eco-fascists, Kaczynski wrote his own manesto entitled Industrial Society and its Future, in which he justied his bombings by saying that modern le was destroying humanity. The manesto begins: ldquoThe Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.Kaczynski was arrested in  by the FBI and is now serving le without the possibility of parole in a federal supermax prison."},{"url":null,"title":"unremembered-scotland-new-book-reveals-fascinating-snippets-nations-history","story":"Getting there had involved overcoming the forces of nature, biding time for tides and the weather to align in an act of grace that would allow a small craft to be hauled on to the narrow, shingle beach.Patience was rewarded. As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance. Thatrsquos the common theme.The Unremembered Places by Patrick Baker is published by Birlinn on May "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  an army at work on the home front","story":"It wasnrsquot until we moved to the country that I needed a diary the way fish need water.

Very slowly beat in the caster sugar. I do this one teaspoon at a time to ensure the air stays in the mixture. When all the sugar has been added, mix the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and then beat into the meringue. Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis.

But for many, that might just be how we are feeling today.\"For some couples this could be an unexpected bonus, but no doubt for many others the lockdown will see a whole new experience develop, one marked by irritations, annoying habits and arguments.

Many couples are finding the need to develop new routines and new ways of managing their days. There are ways to make things a little better.\"Dr Clare Daly, director, doctorate in educational psychology at the University of Strathclyde, said the first few weeks were a time of uncertainty and perhaps a bit of a novelty. However, she added that as the lockdown continues it is beginning to feel like this is the new normal.Daly said: \"Clear feelings of anxiety may have passed.

In this instance, both partners will have very dferent styles of coping with the pandemic now is not the time to make big decisions.

I had to get used to a way of working from home and my husband Scott has been furloughed from work and has effectively become a stay-at-home dad. I have been lsquopretendingrsquo to go to work every day to Thea which has meant me hiding upstairs and coming back for lunch and saying lsquomummyrsquos home. I had been at home with Thea on maternity leave so I know it is a lot for Scott as he is doing the bulk of the childcare during the day.ldquoThere have been some challenges with lockdown but it has been nice to have that extra family time. We have a very close extended family and even go on holidays together, so it has made a nice change to be on our own. I think it has brought us closer together having that unided family time. Although there are moments when I think he needs time on projects in the garage.Husband Scott said although Fiona working from home isnt new although the fact she is having to sneak up to the attic with coffee so their toddler doesnt get upset at her coming and going certainly is.He said: ldquoThe good side of it is getting more family time. Im planning lots of fun activities to keep our daughter entertained and Fiona and I are still having movie nights and making nice meals together to help make le feel as normal as it can be right now.Scott added: ldquoIts given me a new appreciation for Fiona. Her work has a flexible working policy, so she tends to be at home more with Thea. I now understand why she could be so frazzled after a day at home.\"The hard parts are definitely the uncertainty and worrying about family. But also the lack of time to myself, even the drive to work is good thinking time that I used to take for granted.

This coming Friday, at .pm on the dot, around  fans from all over the world will be logging in to join a virtual tasting by one of the greatest bottlers of them all ndash Adelphi.If you know whisky, that one world will have made you stop and take notice.

This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people.

Of four Scottish publishers I spoke to last week, the best cited a  per cent fall in paid-for advertising and two reported it had all but vanished.Last week two other Scottish weekly papers were forced to suspend publication, the West Highland Free Press and the Stranraer  Wigtownshire Free Press, and while their publishers have every intention of ing to print there are no guarantees. So the money from the UK Government advertising campaign canrsquot arrive a moment too soon.Mr Dowden has also written to producers of the UKrsquos  biggest brands to make sure their online advertising policies do not block ads from appearing next to news about the pandemic, as some have been doing, because not only is the information providing a public service, but virus stories are so dominant that such a block is effectively an advertising ban.So Mr Dowden and Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office ndash a former reporter for Aberdeenrsquos Press  Journal ndash are doing what they can to help the newspaper industry survive the crisis, but the Scottish Government also has a role to play. The Scottish Newspaper Society has been in constant dialogue with Scottish ministers and civil servants for the past four weeks to try to achieve similar support for the sector here, and among the requests are an extension of the business rates holiday to news publishers, a support fund and more government advertising as the UK Government has just done.Other countries have launched news support programmes, like Denmark where the government is paying compensation for advertising losses of up to  per cent from a media fund worth poundm, and the devolved Flanders government in Belgium, which also has a compensation package for lost revenues as part of a poundm fund for sport, culture and media. A package is also under discussion in Ireland and most other European countries are working up support programmes.The Scottish Government included newsagents in the list of permitted retailers and acknowledged that journalism and newspaper production is a key service, a crucial recognition which allowed publishers to continue printing, distributing and selling their titles, so there is no doubt that ministers accept the sectorrsquos value.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain. There can be no clearer case for their rights than the work they are doing right now.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us. However old your photo is, as long as it has a picture of a puffin with food in its beak, and you know when and where it was taken, it will help.“Those who join the Puffarazzi are filling key gaps in our knowledge, helping us to understand what threats are facing these little seabirds.

It suggests that early on he was missing in action.Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Governmentrsquos Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said he was ldquooptimistic about finding a vaccine for the Covid- coronavirus with advances in science.But he acknowledged ldquothe truth is we donrsquot have another vaccine for any other human coronavirus and said finding a safe and effective treatment for the latest strain was ldquonot a given.He told Sky Newsrsquos Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ldquoI hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year ndash but thatrsquos a vaccine in a vial, itrsquos a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective.ldquoI think itrsquos crucial to realise having a vaccine in itself, in say a million doses, which you know to be safe and you believe to be effective. That is not the end game.ldquoThe end game is making sure that it is truly effective.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in .

He probably had a measure of anxiety when he started to feel so unwell.Mr Montgomery phoned Liz and his two other sisters Anne and Helen before he was placed on the ventilator on the Saturday afternoon, telling them that it would probably be for a day or two.But our gut feeling was that it wouldn#t be a day or two. That was the last conversation we had with him, said Liz.That has been one of the hardest things, not being able to be with him. We really appreciated being able to ask the nurse caring for him to let him know he was so much in our thoughts and prayers.His minister, Rev Eleanor Hayden, phoned the ward and asked one of the nurses to kindly read Psalm  and say the Lord#s Prayer to him.We are blown away by the kindness of staff and the willingness of them to do this for us, Liz added.It was a tempestuous fortnight for Mr Montgomery#s family who faced the uncertainty of not knowinghe would pull through or not in between the odd glimmer of hope.Liz added: David was a Christian and his faith in Jesus was very important to him.David enjoyed attending his local church and going along to other Christian fellowship gatherings. He had a large circle of friends and could definitely be described as a people person. His quick wit and humour were enjoyed by his nieces and nephews who thought the world of him.Liz explained how a doctor had phoned her sister before he died and assured her staff would be with him.The doctors and nurses handled the situation so professionally and were exceptional in their care and treatment of David, she said. We are thankful to all the nursing and medical staff in the critical care unit and know they did all they could for David and they too were upset his condition did not improve.We really appreciated how David#s neighbours, friends and farming colleagues stood on the roadside to pay their respects at this dficult time.

I should know, I was one of them.  When I last spoke to my former P teacher on March , having bumped into her on East Bridge Street in Enniskillen, she was still as thoughtful as she was when she was teaching me at Jones Memorial Primary School between  and .She wanted to know how I was, asked about my work, and told me to #keep going# just as she did when encouraging the -year-old me to read and write. I discovered my love for creativity and expression in her classroom, which has shaped my le.During our brief conversation, she told me she had been to see her grandchildren a few days before and spoke of her fears over the coronavirus.Stay safe you were the last words she said to me as we walked away. That was Mrs Mathers in a nutshell always looking out for others, always caring.But four weeks later, she would be dead, cruelly taken by Covid-, leaving her family, friends and former pupils mourning the death of a remarkable woman.It is strange to feel sad at the death of someone you only really knew for a year of your le, but Mrs Mathers was an exceptional person and good teachers leave a mark on you. When they die, it almost feels like a tiny part of your childhood goes, too.This week, I found out more about the woman who inspired me and the moments leading up to her death when I spoke to her children, Michael Mathers and Joanne Kirwin, who were still reeling from her passing last Thursday.Her daughter, Joanne, had a choice to make last week as her -year-old mother lay in South West Acute Hospital with Covid-: hear her distinctive voice on the telephone, possibly for the last time, or let her go on a mechanical ventilator without saying a word in the hope that each breathe she took would help rid her of the coronavirus.She chose the latter, dreaming that her formidable mother would overcome the cruel disease, so she could get back to doing what she loved most spending time with her family.Joanne#s brother, Michael, faced similar agony from his home in Glasgow as he liaised with hospital staff and relayed updates back to his sister in Manchester. Both have lived away from Fermanagh for years and last week, neither of them had ever felt as far away from home nor as helpless as the invisible killer prevented them from being by their mother#s bedside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old Ottilie FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old OttilieYvonne, a healthy mother, grandmother, sister, friend and a much-loved former teacher who inspired a generation of children, passed away while a member of the hospital#s medical team wearing a mask and a gown gently held her hand in the absence of her family. The word we keep using is shock. It#s very surreal for many reasons because in part we are in lockdown and so it doesn#t feel like it#s really happened. We#ve not gone through those rituals of mourning and that order of how you do things has not happened, Joanne told The Impartial Reporter.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator JoanneWe knew the coronavirus was coming we all heard about it, but without sounding arrogant about it, a lot of us thought it wouldn#t happen to us. It hasn#t really hit us yet, it feels like something you see on TV, she said.Joanne recalled the moment her mother was advised to go on a ventilator, explaining how she toyed with the idea of phoning her, having spent time exchanging text messages.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator. She was probably going to be quite breathless and I didn#t want to take that breath from her.Part of me thinks should I have, then the selfish part of me wants to remember her voice and when I last saw her and how happy and healthy she was, she said.Joanne smiles as she recalls her mother#s love for her children Matilda, five, and six-month-old Ottilie and their love for her.She always encouraged us, she always wanted the best for us. She always wanted me and Michael to be happy and be settled and not have to worry about us, she said.Yvonne had worked for the Western Education and Library Board Advisory Service and previously taught at Jones Memorial Primary School.She did take the teacher in her home, laughed Joanne.Michael and I had to remind her that #we are home now and are not your pupils#! She could be in teacher mode as most teachers tend to be, so there were overlaps with school and home le, she said.While Yvonne adored teaching, she told Joanne that her biggest joy was having grandchildren, joking that she liked being able to hand them back.She loved having grandchildren apart from the fact she said it made her feel old. She used to come over to Manchester, but it wasn#t to see me, the only reason was to see the girls! They brought her real joy, she said.With her mother now gone so too is a part of her, admits Joanne.I am  now, but I always had somewhere to go. She used to say no matter what age her children were, she was always our mum. But no matter what age you are, you#ve lost your mum, that place to go, that sense of safety that you don#t think you need when you#re .But when it#s gone, you#ve lost that, there is a hole, that driving force is no more. I will never forget the love and happiness she got from the girls and how happy she made them, as well as how happy they made her, she said.Mum was taking all the precautions MichaelScattered around Yvonne#s now-empty home at Ashbourne Manor - where last week, neighbours took to the street to hold a poignant vigil for her - are bottles of hand sanitiser, an indication of how seriously she was taking the pandemic. When her son, Michael, arrived at the weekend, having travelled back for her burial outside Portadown, where she was originally from, he found evidence of how worried his mother, who was prone to chest infections, was.Mum was taking all the precautions, he said, describing his shock.Even when she got the positive case, we thought, #Sure you#re strong enough to work through it#, and then when we got the call on Thursday of last week at .pm, the nurses were saying she seemed quite stable, then by half five, we got a call that she was not going to make it and by seven o#clock, she had passed away. That#s a microcosm of how I am feeling it is so up and down, he said.After feeling ill for more than a week, Yvonne had a choice of going into hospital and took it, believing that she was in the right place.Even in this period, she was still making smart decisions. She was very self-aware, she took it in her stride. She said, #That#s what I have got#, and spoke very positively of the nurses.The last I spoke to her on the Sunday night, she was getting tired she was advised to go on the ventilator and thought it was the right thing to do.She recognised what she needed to do, so all of her choices were the right ones at the right time, said Michael.His mother was hugely supportive, he says, particularly during dficult periods of his le.She told me, #You are always going to be my son#. She was very encouraging, but she was very direct when she needed to be, very black and white, no real nonsense.If she needed to tell you to pull your socks up, that#s what she did in a loving and caring way. She kept us all together and I couldn#t have asked for more throughout my le.Among the children she has inspired is Michael#s daughter, Ella, who is now eight-and-a-half.The biggest regret is that she is not here to see Ella, Matilda or Ottilie grow up and become women themselves. That#s the biggest challenge in the future, encountering birthdays and looking around the room and realising that she#s not there.She wasn#t just a mother, or a grandmother, or a friend. She was an important role model in many people#s lives, he said.This was true.I once got  out of  in my spellings and she asked me what I had for breakfast.Coco Pops, I replied. She laughed and told the rest of my class to eat Coco Pops.I remember telling mum we had to buy some, texted my old classmate, Roisin Francis, this week.It takes a big heart to shape little minds.Mrs Mathers had a huge heart and didn#t just teach, she touched all our lives.

However,the gowns are not available, clinical staff treating positive patients have now been advised by the UK Department of Health to wear disposable, non-fluid repellent gowns or coveralls or washable surgical gowns, with aprons, and to wash their forearms afterwards.It also says that staff should consider reusing PPE where necessarysupplies are low.The Department of Health here said Northern Ireland#s Public Health Agency will soon be issuing new advice on when particular items such as visors can be reused depending on the area of work. But a spokesperson said: This guidance on the reuse of PPE is not implemented in Northern Ireland at this point, andor when it might be required the Department will consider this taking account of the national and scientic evidence and will provide further advise at the appropriate time.They said the Department of Health here understands staff on the frontline need reassurance. We believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will play a part in allaying concerns, they said, advising any staff with concerns to email . Health chiefs in Northern Ireland say they have secured millions of items from international and local suppliers.Sinn Fein health spokesperson Colm Gildernew said he spoke directly with Health Minister Robin Swann to appeal to him not to adopt the same measures on Public Health England here. Of particular concern within these revised guidelines is that single use PPE can be re-used – something such PPE is not designed to do, Mr Gildernew said. This will put frontline health staff – already putting themselves in harm’s way on a daily basis – at an increased risk.Meanwhile, a signicant number of nurses in Northern Ireland responding to a Royal College of Nursing survey conducted over the Easter weekend said they felt under pressure to work in situations where there was not adequate PPE. Nearly half of those surveyed from Northern Irelandhelping patients in such areas reported being asked to re-use items of protective equipment marked single use by manufacturers.Of those treating Covid- patients where, over a thirdsaid they were being asked to re-use.Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland said: “We all know that nursing staff have been under enormous pressure during this pandemic, however it is shocking to find that nurses are feeling pressurised to work without the protection they need.”The Royal College of Surgeons of Englandhas also advised workers not to risk their health by working without adequate personal protective equipmentamid fears that hospitals could run out of supplies.The fear from medics comes as more than , patients have now died in hospital after testing positive for the disease in the UK, with thousands more deaths expected in care homes.A further  deaths as a result of coronavirus were announced in Northern Ireland on Saturday, along with a further  confirmed cases of the virus, in the biggest daily rise to date. It brings the total number of cases here to ,.Mr Gildernew called for the Department of Health here to offer reassurance to healthcare staff. The Department of Health needs to listen to frontline workers and their unions give assurances that the revised guidance will not be adopted here and the minister should redouble his efforts to ensure sufficient supply of PPE is secured and made available when and where it is needed.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said a consignment of  tonnes of PPE was due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday.He said this shipment included , gowns - the supply of which NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said on Saturday was now critical. Supply in some areas, particularly gowns and certain types of masks and aprons, is in short supply at the moment, and that must be an extremely anxious time for people working on the front line, Mr Jenrick said, But they should be assured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus updates: UK government pledges extra £m in funding as  further deaths confirmed in Northern IrelandThe UK government has said they will provide an extra £ million towards tackling the coronavirus crisis in Northern Ireland.Most ReadLawyers who acted for Paddy Jackson in rugby rape trial sue Rory Best for libel Near-tragedy brings clarity on Covid- lockdown to BBC Radio Ulster broadcaster Coronavirus updates: UK government pledges extra £m in funding as  further deaths confirmed in Northern IrelandCo Down crash victim Matthew Stuart a cancer survivor who was due to wed in Familiar Northern Ireland faces roll back years for some #Me At # photo fun,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly.

All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that.

We went from that point to less than a month later when everyone was fully working from home and set up to work the same way as they can do from the office.ldquoAll our client services have been maintained over the past few weeks. There has been no disruption to our clients whatsoever which means that we can continue to do business and generate revenue.Sinead said the boys are getting used to doing their school work at home but are missing the school routine and their friends.She added: ldquoThis week the boys have got used to this new world we are all now in. Whatrsquos important is that work colleagues are in the same position sothe children do come up behind me in a video call, the guys on the other end are totally understanding as they are experiencing the same challenges.ldquoIrsquom fortunate to work for an employer who understands that we have to be adaptable and flexible as we are trying to home-school and be parent and work all at the same time.Sinead said the recent spell of good weather has been a blessing as her sons are happy to play outside by themselves in the garden.ldquoI try and get as much done as I can during the day so I can clock off to make dinner and spend some time with the children, get them out into the fresh air and do some schoolwork with them where possible, said explained.ldquoWith regards to schoolwork, I probably put myself under pressure for the first week but Irsquove relaxed more as Irsquom not a teacher theyrsquore doing well and Irsquom a busy working mummy. We do the schoolwork and the boys are getting used to school work away from the classroom.ldquoThe school is sending lots of really good material for the boys to do through dferent apps and programs and they have been very user-friendly.While she is working to ensure that her sons are sheltered from knowing just how critical the situation is outside, Sinead realises that they have taken in the changes.ldquoWe went to a supermarket for me to get groceries and they noticed that nearly all the other shops were closed, the car park was nearly empty and I had to queue alone to get in.ldquoThey understood that the world was dferent.Sinead believes that a new era of flexibility, particularly when conducting interviews with candidates over video conferencing may stick with her company when the lockdown is over.She added: ldquoI think we are learning in our organisation is that how effectively you can work from home.

Last year he opened the Acoustic stage at the Glastonbury Festival.He also opened for Snow Patrol in the US, Europe and Asia and stood in as an honorary member of the band when guitarist Johnny McDaid was recovering after surgery.The son of Nuala and John McMullan, who still in Portaferry, Ryan started off performing at a young age, singing in a local band, Purple Road, when he was in his mid-teens.He is now staying at his Belfast home, having made it back from the US last month, just two days before the country closed off its airports.Many of his concerts have had to be postponed, including two nights at the Portico Theatre in Portaferry, now rescheduled to June -, and hisUK and Ireland tour this month. He had also been due to headline his first festival, Vearsai in Donegal, last weekend.Ryanrsquos current single, In A Heartbeat, is on the new EP along with Ruthless Cupid, Some Kind of Perfect and Outcry.He explained: ldquoThese songs reflect a handful of times where it felt like Cupid has been toying with me. Amusing himself by throwing me into situations where Irsquom either out of my depth, hoping for reconciliation, or unable to escape the truth that even at theend, Irsquom still holding on to even the worst of my attempts at love.ldquoIn A Heartbeat was written to sum up a stage I think we all kind of go through sooner or later: the understanding that something that once was, is now no more.But even at the end knowing it still has a hold on you, so much so, that no matter how toxic it is, or how little sense it made, yoursquod still run back to it in a desperate attempt to salvage it.The new single is already going down well with fans as the video has been viewed over , times online.Ryan added: ldquoEverything has been going great for me so far, even without my debut album coming out and that. I donrsquot think that all these tracks will be on my new album when I feel that itrsquos ready to be released.

This has enabled us to expand the nursing and midwery workforce by reaching out to those who have retired or lapsed their registration over the past number of years and provided opportunities for early registration for overseas staff.ldquoI am exceptionally grateful for the excellent response demonstrated by those who have volunteered toto practice and support the professional response to this pandemic.ldquoEach and every new registrant on the emergency register is a very welcome addition to the professional team and the support you will provide will have a signicant impact on outcomes for patients and the multidisciplinary workforce.Mrs McArdle said she wanted to specically thank nursing and midwery students for their ldquovaluable contribution to the delivery of safe, person-centred care as members of the nursing and midwery team.ldquoI recognise that this is an uncertain time causing great anxiety for many of you and your families. The NMC have revised pre-registration programmes and provided students with options to undertake clinical placements in an attempt to expand the nursing and midwery workforce. This approach enables students to continue their educational programme whilst contributing to clinical services during the pandemic. ldquoThe chief nurse also acknowledged the concerns raised over the issue of personal protective equipmentover the past number of weeks, insisting that the safety of frontline staff is of the utmost importance.She said ldquoconcrete action was being taken to ensure the supply of PPE and the safe use of the equipment for all staff caring for patients during the COVID- pandemic.Mrs McArdle said no matter where nurses and midwives are providing care, the use of appropriate PPE must be prioritised.She added: ldquoWhat we are currently experiencing is unprecedented and extraordinarily dficult for everyone. I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach.

This is the first time this has happened since the foot and mouth outbreak in .There is a possibility of point-to-point bumpers on racecourses when jump racing s and also an expanded autumn season.The national hunt season has ended which means no Irish Grand National on Easter Monday and no Punchestown Festival mdash Irelandrsquos Cheltenham mdash at the end of the month.Gordon Elliott, who had two winners at the recent Downpatrick meeting and who had  horses in training, is now down to , so he has had to cut back on staff.The end of the point-to-point season is a severe blow to local trainers like Paddy Turley, Stuart Crawford, Colin McKeever and Warren Ewing, who produce young horses to sell after running them in four year-old races.I understand that Co Wexford trainer Donnchadh Doyle had  four year-olds ready to make their debuts and there are a lot more trainers in the same boat.When racing resumes it will be all flat racing for a month, so with Downpatrick now only running jump racing it will be some time until locals get back to their favourite venue.With the English jump season also curtailed it is good to know that Newtownhamilton native Brian Hughes, who rode his first ever winner as a flat apprentice for his boss Kevin Prendergast at Downpatrick, has been crownedchampion jockey for the first time, with a total of  wins,  clear of reigning champion Richard Johnston.Sadly this weekrsquos news has seen thousands of horses taken out of training.With the English national hunt season coming to a close earlier than originally planned, itrsquos well done to Ballee native David Maxwell on riding a total of  winners from a total of only  rides. He rides all his own horses.It was also a very good season for another Downpatrick rider, Danny McMenamin, who is attached to the yard of Nicky Richards, for whom Tony Dobbin was stable jockey for many years.Danny, who gets plenty of rides for other yards, rode a fantastic  winners from  rides. He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

At the age of five, he climbed Slieve Donard, with a broken arm.“We just say, ‘We’re going up the mountain’ and he’s at the door waiting to go into the car,” Mr Shiels said.Although Daniel is non-verbal, he has good receptive language and no mobility issues so enjoys running as a way to burn off steam.Daniel’s father noted: “It’s not always plain sailing, but we try to get him out to show him that we can achieve these things by just putting a bit of effort in.”Michael, a sales manager, and Bernarde, who works in catering, both love to run in their spare time.Through Daniel’s marathon, they wanted to show that children with autism “can excel in dferent areas”.While lockdown has been a struggle for many, Daniel’s father said: “The thing about families with special needs, we’re somewhat socially isolated all year round.”Sean Quinn, founder of the charity, called Daniel “a magical wee man”.“He doesn’t realise it, but he’s inspiring so many young people to do the same,” he said.Daniel is due to complete the remaining . miles of his marathon in the coming days.Because a marathon is . miles, he is planning to donate £. himself when he finishes.Donations can be made at justgiving crowdfunding isolatedrunnerRight: From left, Daniel Shiels second right, with brother Michael, , Bernarde Shiels, and dad Michael Shiels\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

She is currently putting our exhausted son to bed. I step into the back garden to drink in the last drops of warm air before the nighttime chill descends.My thoughts turn, as they usually do around this time of the week, to what I will write about in my column.I sit there for some time, my mind barren.No sound, just colour in the garden \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I look around, trying to take the perspective outside of my own thoughts. There are colours in the garden - ochre, pale yellow, startling pink, and ying depths of green.I’m no gardener and I’m struck by how this cycle continues without any interference or direction from me. But, while some buds have sprouted already, others remain just a promise. Plants, like people, develop at their own pace.There is something even more erting than the wash of the leaves it is the sound. Or rather, the lack of it. The air is still tonight so there is no rustle from the tips of the trees. The birdsong has long since quietened.More, there is no low thunder of traffic from the nearby road, no distant rumble of a plane in the sky. There are no cries of children playing, no adults talking. There is no urgent rush of oil burners boiling.I have sat in the same spot on countless evenings before, but I’m not sure I’ve ever noticed this vacuum before. Is it always this way, or is this another manestation of our new condition The silence is, at the same time, both reassuring and disconcerting. I enjoy the peace, but still like to hear some activity, just to remind me that there is something  out there, on the other side of the garden fence. I crunch my feet on the loose stones, just to create a sound.I take a moment and consider the day just passed. I’m reluctantly forced to admit that it has been pleasant. I feel a certain guilt in this, knowing so much about how many are suffering at this time. But, undeniably, there is an degree of attraction in this slower pace of le.This was a family day. The three of us shared breakfast and dinner at the same table, played together, watched a film, went for a walk. I wore a sun hat. Our son talked a lot and we listened. Later, when my boy is dreaming, my we and I will watch something silly on TV. She will have a glass of wine while I munch crisps. There is nothing  to do.I have written a lot in previous weeks about the strain that lockdown has brought to me and others. While that is true, it is only honest to state that it is not the full picture. This adversity has also created a more profound appreciation and distinction of what is important in our lives, and what we can do without.I think about what I miss most of the old le. Being able to see extended family and friends, watching my son playing with those of his own age. Much beyond that now seems dispensable. My whole le has been lived aggrandising sport to appear more important than it should be. Now, I find, I don’t think much about it. The new reality has separated the substance from the garnish.I consider how a normal day off work, before the pandemic, would have looked. There would have been a panic to squeeze in many activities. We would have tried to take our son to a class or play date in the morning, fought our way around a supermarket or clothes shop, visited people, forced some small talk, perhaps gone out for dinner, all while I followed the progress of multiple sporting events on my phone and checked social media. It would have been typically frenzied.This frenzy is of mind as well as action. I can explain this best through a simple example. I enjoy drinking pure apple juice. Apple juice with other flavours added, I enjoy less. When I go to the shop I often set myself the task of buying the plain juice. Yet, more often than not, I get home to find I have bought apple juice flavoured with pear, elderflower or, worst of all, cucumber and mint.The problem is clear, it is a symptom of a cluttered mind. Forever anxious about the next thing that needs to be done, and the thing after that, and not focusing on what is in front of my eyes. Sometimes, it feels that I can only think with clarity when I write, it is the most effective way of finding a path through this troubled maze.It is hard to look past the current pandemic when the agony being suffered by many is absolute. As I said earlier, its claw is so long and pointed that I now feel a degree of guilt when I’m enjoying an experience that I know others cannot.But the crisis will pass and then some of the things that enrich and colour our lives will start up again. Perhaps we will be just as we were before, perhaps, because the trauma has the potential to improve us, we will be slightly altered. The upsurge in kindness and compassion which has become apparent throughout communities will hopefully prove more tenacious than the virus which spawned it.The air is cooler now and I’m surprised at how long I’ve been sitting in the same spot. It is harder to see the plants in the half-light but the night seems just as peaceful as what passed before. I enjoy it for a few more moments before I go back inside.One of the many effects of the lockdown has been to sharpen my senses towards what is around me. It has given me the chance to spend time with my we and son that I would otherwise have missed. Distractions have been removed as the regulations mean we have settled into a more sedate, purer set of habits.Tomorrow will be another family day. We have nothing in particular to do and nowhere that we need, or are allowed to go. It will be just the three of us in our home. I’m looking forward to it.When everything  is taken away, what is left is what is most important. And, as I constantly remind myself, it’s all that I really need.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Only a generation ago, during the rule of the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban in the late s, girls were not allowed to go to school, and Somayarsquos own mother was pulled out of classes at a young age.After the US invasion of Afghanistan in , girls ed to schools, but gaining equal rights remains a struggle. vw,vw,px, px\"The girls are developing two types of ventilator device using car parts Somaya is undaunted. ldquoWe are the new generation, she said in a phone interview. ldquoWe fight and work for people. Girl and boy, it does not matter anymore.Afghanistan faces the pandemic nearly empty-handed. It has only  ventilators for a population of more than . million. So far, it has reported just over  coronavirus cases, including  deaths, but the actual number is suspected to be much higher since test kits are in short supply.The Herat province in western Afghanistan is one of the nationrsquos hotspots because of its proximity to Iran, the regionrsquos epicentre of the outbreak.This has spurred Somaya and her team, aged  to , to help come up with a solution.At their workshop, the team is experimenting with two designs, including an open-source blueprint from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The parts being used include the motor of a Toyota windshield wiper, batteries and sets of bag valve masks, or manual oxygen pumps. A group of mechanics helps them build the frame of a ventilator. vw,vw,px, px\"The girls are all part of Afghanistanrsquos prize-winning girlsrsquo robotics team Daniela Rus, a professor at MIT, welcomed the teamrsquos initiative to develop the prototype. ldquoIt will be excellent to see it tested and locally produced, she said.Tech entrepreneur Roya Mahboob, who founded the team and raises funds to empower girls, said she hopes Somayarsquos group will finish building a prototype by May or June. In all, the team has  members who work on ious projects.The ventilator model, once completed, would then be sent to the Health Ministry for testing, initially on animals, said spokesman Wahid Mayar.Somaya, who was just  when she participated in the first World Robot Olympiad in the US in , said she and her team members hope to make a contribution.ldquoAfghans should be helping Afghanistan in this pandemic, she said. ldquoWe should not wait for others..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Afghan schoolgirls work on turning car parts into ventilator article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His leadership has been clear.ldquoHersquos been inspirational at times.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth later argued that Mr Goversquos line that one or two aspects of The Sunday Times story were off beam is ldquopossibly the weakest rebuttal of a detailed expose in British political history.He told Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ldquoThere are serious questions as to why the Prime Minister skipped five Cobra meetings throughout February, when the whole world could see how serious this was becoming.ldquoAnd we know that serious mistakes have been made, we know that our front-line NHS staff donrsquot have the PPE, that theyrsquove been told this weekend that they wonrsquot necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe. We know that our testing capacity is not at the level that is needed. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson, pictured on April , was accused by Labour of being lsquomissing in actionrsquo at the start of the coronavirus crisis ldquoWe know that the ventilators that many hospitals have received are the wrong types of ventilators and there are big questions as to whether we went into this lockdown too slowly, and now we hear the Prime Minister missed five meetings at the start of this outbreak. It suggests that early on he was missing in action.Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Governmentrsquos Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said he was ldquooptimistic about finding a vaccine for the Covid- coronavirus with advances in science.But he acknowledged ldquothe truth is we donrsquot have another vaccine for any other human coronavirus and said finding a safe and effective treatment for the latest strain was ldquonot a given.He told Sky Newsrsquos Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ldquoI hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year ndash but thatrsquos a vaccine in a vial, itrsquos a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective.ldquoI think itrsquos crucial to realise having a vaccine in itself, in say a million doses, which you know to be safe and you believe to be effective. That is not the end game.ldquoThe end game is making sure that it is truly effective. Itrsquos effective in the elderly, effective in young children, effective right across the age group in all populations.ldquoAnd then you have to manufacture that in billions of doses to administer them to the world.ldquoThat is an enormous scientic challenge, itrsquos also an enormous logistics and delivery challenge. vw,vw,px, px\"Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said a shipment of PPE that is due to arrive in the country is ldquoa few daysrsquo supply and ldquomay be enough to avert an absolute crisis over this weekend, but added that ldquoit doesnrsquot solve the longer term problem.Meanwhile, speaking about Mr Johnsonrsquos health following his treatment for coronavirus, Mr Gove said: ldquoThe Prime Minister is recovering well. Hersquos in cheerful spirits.ldquoHe had the opportunity to talk to Dominic Raab, his deputy, the First Secretary of State, on Friday.ldquoAnd the Prime Ministerrsquos instructions to the rest of us in Government were communicated by the First Secretary of State when we had a conference call yesterday morning.Mr Johnson was treated for Covid- in intensive care at St Thomasrsquo Hospital in London earlier this month and is now recuperating at his country estate Chequers..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ministers downplay talk of early easing of coronavirus lockdown article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
