Back then, Margaret Thatcher decided to break up municipal bus companies everywhere across England, except London. \u0027We have had 35 years of rising fares, routes being cut and passenger numbers falling. We have barely any night buses, no Oyster system and no daily cap.\u0027I mention it to help people understand why the North feels the way it does and, hopefully, win some support for our calls. A single bus journey in Harpurhey, Greater Manchester, should cost the same as one in Haringey, London — ie £1.55, not £4 plus. Is that so unreasonable? I don’t think so. Levelling up should mean London-style transport for all English city regions.\u0027If London got behind that, it would reflect well on it and reduce anti-London feeling.\u0027Mr Burnham\u0027s acceptance of a column in a newspaper whose readership is 200 miles from his political base in the North West comes as he admits he would like to lead Labour after Keir Starmer. But he also singled out for praise a potential rival, London mayor Sadiq Khan, saying he should be given additional powers to put him on a par with his counterparts in New York and Paris.Mr Khan himself raised eyebrows yesterday when he visited a factory in Yorkshire.The Mayor of London visited an electric bus factory in North Yorkshire, which manufactures state-of-the-art vehicles for London\u0027s 500-strong zero-emission fleet. At the weekend Mr Burnham claimed Labour would have held on to more northern seats at the  2019 election if he had been party leader instead of Jeremy Corbyn.The Greater Manchester mayor made the claim as he revealed he would run for the leadership again after the next election if he had enough support.Mr Burnham, a former health secretary under Gordon Brown, came a distant second to hard Left icon Mr Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership election, polling just 19 per cent of votes.He served as a shadow minister before quitting national politics to become mayor of Manchester before Labour\u0027s catastrophic display at the 2019 election, its worst since the 1930s.But buoyed by an increased majority in Manchester in the election last week, and Keir Starmer\u0027s increasing difficulty over Labour\u0027s wider results, Mr Burnham has learned towards a new run at the party leadership.Speaking to the Observer he was deeply critical of modern Labour\u0027s failure to take a stronger stance on major policy issues, particularly social care reform, and said the party lacked the boldness to attempt any move on the scale of its greatest achievement - creating the NHS in 1948.Mr Burnham said had he beaten Mr Corbyn to the leadership six years ago he would have been more successful in stopping the Conservatives from breaking the so-called \u0027red wall\u0027 - including the many northern heartland seats lost in the 2019 general election, and the crushing defeat endured in this month\u0027s Hartlepool by-election.\u0027I still think life would have been different if I had won,\u0027 said Mr Burnham, who romped to victory in his mayoral election on May 6, taking all 215 wards in Greater Manchester.\u0027I think we would be stronger in taking on the Government. I don\u0027t think we\u0027d have lost as many northern seats had I won.\u0027An Opinium poll published in the paper shows Mr Burnham - who also failed in a 2010 leadership bid - is widely seen as the most likely and able successor to current leader Sir Keir Starmer, with 47 per cent ranking him on top, ahead of 35 per cent for London mayor Sadiq Khan and 29 per cent for Leeds Central MP and former Labour frontbencher Hilary Benn.Andy Burnham: The Government wants to ide us but together we are a powerful force | Evening Standard"},{"url":null,"title":"Now second Eurovision singer tests positive coronavirus not perform live final","story":"Share this articleEBU Statement: Duncan Laurence tests positive for COVID-19 - Eurovision Song Contest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11a5b4cbb04cdbc4e2a54748a7f5db0a72302b98/0_20_5198_3119/master/5198.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=450aeab62dae86b3b12f2d2b3475dd19","title":"us politics live israel joe biden bernie sanders covid coronavirus","story":"The final vote was 213 to 212, with three progressive members -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Jamaal Bowman of New York -- voting “present” on the legislation. Three other House progressives -- Cori Bush of Missouri, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts -- joined their Republican colleagues in opposing the bill. According to multiple reports, the progressive lawmakers expressed concern about insufficient accountability for law enforcement officers whose agencies would receive funding from the bill. The bill barely passed the House, and it faces significant hurdles in the Senate, where members of both parties have expressed reservations about the proposal.Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez voted present, joining Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Jamaal Bowman of New York.According to multiple reports, a group of House progressives raised some last-minute concerns about accountability for law enforcement officers whose agencies would be receiving money from the legislation. So far, only one Democrat -- congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- has voted against the bill. Two other House progressives, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Jamaal Bowman of New York, have voted “present”.“I think the whole thing is to spend the summer impeaching, again, Donald Trump. That’s all we’re doing. It’s a dog-and-pony show. ... It’s another impeachment,” the Republican congressman told HuffPost. During the insurrection, rioters, who were frustrated with the vice-president’s adherence to the Constitution as lawmakers certified Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election, shouted, “Hang Mike Pence!” Shortly after the insurrection occurred, Pence described his brother as a “hero” for overseeing the certification of the election.Schumer said the Senate will take action on the bill “very soon”. Schumer encouraged his Republican colleagues to support the commission bill, after most House Republicans voted against the proposal. The Democratic leader accused Republicans of “spinelessness” in the face of Donald Trump’s lies about fraud in the presidential election. “Even now, five months to the day after he left office, the Republican party is still so terrified of Donald Trump that they are apparently willing to abandon the truth and the safety of our democracy on into the future,” Schumer said. “Maybe, despite the opposition of the Republican leader - the unfortunate and sad opposition of the Republican leader - enough of my Republican colleagues will step up and join with Democrats to establish the commission. They will get a chance to do so very soon.”  If Schumer brings the bill to the floor and Republicans block it, it could become the first official Senate filibuster of this Congress.The Democratic speaker said too many House members are unvaccinated to justify relaxing the mask guidance, an argument that the attending physician of the Capitol has echoed. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy introduced a resolution yesterday to allow members to go maskless on the House floor, but the measure failed. “Until they are vaccinated, we cannot have meetings without masks,” Pelosi said. She said her unvaccinated colleagues were “selfishly an endangerment” to those around them.“We’re very pleased with the number of Republicans who voted for truth and justice,” the Democratic speaker said. However, most House Republicans voted against the bill, and many Republican senators have already signaled they will likely oppose the legislation as well. Asked what yesterday’s vote says about the state of the Republican party, Pelosi said she has told her friends on the other side of the aisle to “take back your party”. She argued there is “courage that needs to be recognized” among Republicans like Liz Cheney, who has denounced Donald Trump’s lies about fraud in the presidential election.The Democratic speaker opened her remarks by applauding the House for passing the anti-Asian American hate crimes bill on Tuesday. The bill will establish a point person at the department of justice to expedite the review of coronavirus-related hate crimes against members of the AAPI community. Joe Biden will sign the bill later today. In a tweet this morning, the president said, “Hate has no place in America – and I look forward to making that clear this afternoon by signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.” The bill is a direct response to the January 6 insurrection, when rioters were able to gain access to the Capitol as lawmakers certified Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential race. The vote on the security proposal comes one day after the House passed a bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. Most House Republicans voted against that bill, and they are also expected to largely oppose the funding boost for Capitol security. Congresswoman Kay Granger, the top Republican on the House appropriations committee, said during the floor debate, “The bill we are considering today implements permanent recommendations before ongoing security assessments are complete.”The Democratic speaker will likely be asked about yesterday’s passage of a bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the January 6 insurrection. The bill passed with the support of every House Democrat and 35 of their Republican colleagues, but it faces major hurdles in the Senate, where minority leader Mitch McConnell has already said he will oppose it. “It sounds like they are afraid of the truth, and that’s most unfortunate, but hopefully they’ll get used to the idea that the American people want us to find the truth,” Pelosi said yesterday. The press conference is scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes, so stay tuned.  Legislation to cancel utility debts for millions of low-income households and bail out struggling utility companies is to be introduced in the US Senate on Thursday. Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator from Oregon, will propose a $30bn low-interest loans program for electric, water and sewage and broadband providers as part of the Maintaining Access to Essential Services During the Covid Emergency Act of 2021. The loans would allow utilities to recoup money in order to stay afloat without resorting to fines and shutoffs. Utilities have long justified using disconnections as a way to force people to keep up with bills. “We cannot rebuild the strength and resilience of America from the ground up if millions of families lose electricity, water and broadband, we have to keep these essential services turned on if people are going to get back on their feet,” Merkley told the . “This is like PPE for utilities. If we can get the concept in place, we can later add more funds if needed.” It’s unclear how much is owed to utility companies nationwide, though it is probably significantly more than the $30bn earmarked in the bill.  “I believe that the United States must help lead the way to a peaceful and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians,” the progressive senator said on Twitter in response to a story about his planned resolution. He added, “We need to take a hard look at whether the sale of these weapons is actually helping do that, or whether it is simply fueling conflict.” Sanders’ language mirrors that of a separate resolution he introduced yesterday, which emphasized the importance of Israeli and Palestinian lives. “Whereas every Palestinian life matters and whereas every Israeli life matters: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate ... urges an immediate cease-fire,” Sanders’ resolution said. The resolution was in response to a separate measure from Republican senator Rick Scott affirming US support for Israel.Biden called on Netanyahu to work toward a ceasefire yesterday, but the prime minister then said Israeli is “determined” to continue the Gaza airstrikes until their aims are met. However, Israeli military leaders have now signaled they believe the attacks have already achieved their “goals”.Israel and Palestinian militants halted their fire for several hours early on Thursday as efforts to reach a truce appeared to gather momentum, a day after Joe Biden called publicly for progress towards a ceasefire. It was not immediately clear if the eight-hour quiet – the longest since the attacks began 11 days ago – was part of an agreement or a temporary lull in the violence. The brief calm was broken later on Thursday when air-raid sirens sounded in Israel near the Gaza frontier, and Israel’s military said a fighter jet had struck a rocket launcher. However, previous ceasefires have been preceded by similar hours-long halts in fighting, which are seen as a trust-building measure. A Hamas official had earlier said a ceasefire was in reach, and Israeli media reports suggested the military believed its “goals” had largely been met. Progressive senator Bernie Sanders plans to introduce a resolution today disapproving of the US selling $735 million of weapons to Israel, according to multiple reports. Sanders told the Post: “At a moment when US-made bombs are devastating Gaza, and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a congressional debate.” The resolution comes a day after Biden called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make immediate progress toward “de-escalation” in Gaza. A ceasefire appears to be within reach after days of violence that have killed hundreds of people, most of them Palestinian. The blog will have more details on the resolution and the potential ceasefire coming up, so stay tuned."},{"url":null,"title":"what if flying reduced your carbon footprint","story":"Wind power pioneer Henrik Stiesdal is developing an aviation fuel from agricultural waste and green hydrogen that actually removes carbon from the atmosphere.Imagine a scenario where flying on planes reduced your carbon footprint. Wind power pioneer Henrik Stiesdal is developing an aviation fuel from agricultural waste and green hydrogen that actually removes carbon from the atmosphere.He told the Dublin Climate Dialogues conference that his new SkyClean fuel is produced by burning agricultural waste in a pyrolysis oven and combining some of the components with green hydrogen to create biomethanol, which can then be synthesised into aviation fuel.The end product is a fuel that is chemically the same to the A-1 jet fuel currently used by airlines but produced in a way that removes carbon from the atmosphere, which means its carbon negative.Trips“You could completely decarbonise aviation – there’s enough agricultural waste in the world to fuel aircraft several times over,” Mr Stiesdal said.“So you could say, be a good citizen, take some more holiday trips to Thailand, ” he saidThe technology is on track to be commercialised by 2025 and promises to be the most climate-friendly option to clean up the aviation industry, which is viewed as one of the hardest to decarbonise. It could also lead to an expansion in aviation, Mr Stiesdal said.The former chief technology officer at Siemens Wind Power told the conference that wind and solar were the only renewables with scale needed to quickly move away from fossil fuels.Mr Stiesdal also spoke about the gap between government pledges on climate and their actions.TargetsHe said a legal case taken in Germany, which found the government’s climate change laws were insufficient and violated fundamental freedoms by putting the burden of curbing emissions on the young was a template that’s likely to be used by activists more and more. Germany’s Constitutional Court ruled in April that the country’s 2019 climate protection act is in part unconstitutional.“The regulations irreversibly postpone high emission reduction burdens until periods after 2030,” the court said, while adding that the the law did not explain in enough detail how greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced after 2031.The judges gave the government until the end of next year to draw up clearer reduction targets."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Damien Eagers  The  Now is the time to further regulate short-term lettings such as Airbnb rentals before the resumption of international travel, the Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has said.Mr O’Brien confirmed comments he made privately to the Fine Gael parliamentary party that the Government intends to crackdown on Airbnb lettings that should not be advertising online.Under the new plans a property would not be allowed to advertise on the platform without the requisite planning permission.At present, iniduals renting out a home for more than 90 days or landlords letting out a second property to tourists or others on a short-term basis must apply for planning permission either on a new or retention basis. There has been criticism, however, that this is not adequately regulated or enforced and homes are still being advertised without permission.“Decent regulations were brought in in 2019 around the planning permission that would be required for any homes that are used for more than 90 days a year. The problem has been the enforcement of that frankly,” Mr O’Brien said in Dublin on Thursday.“What we are working on in conjunction with Minister Catherine Martin’s department is a mechanism whereby you would regulate the platforms. Effectively what that means is that somebody would not be able to advertise a short-term letting property unless they had received the requisite planning permission to do so.“Now is the time to do it particularly when we don’t have throngs of international visitors here. We have been working on this for some time. We have looked at other models in continental Europe in particular. Most capital cities in Europe have a stronger regulation than we have and I think we can do this in the short term.”“I hope to conclude that (work) by the end of the summer,” he added.Fine Gael senator Tim Lombard said that “Airbnb is effectively sucking the life out of rental markets in villages, towns and cities across the country, leaving local people locked out of accessing homes.”He said that an Airbnb property which is occupied for three months during the summer season can make “significantly more money than a property rented out for 12 months.”“However, by letting properties on a seasonal basis, large amounts of homes across the country are lying vacant for the vast majority of the year.“During a time when we’re facing a critical lack of supply of housing, we can’t afford to have perfectly good homes lying empty for over 50 per cent of the year. “While tourists might want to book a holiday home for a two-week break during the summer, local families are left struggling to find a home at a price they can afford.”Mr Lombard said that Kinsale has seen rental prices increase over the past few years due to lack of supply in the local property market.“At the same time, we’ve seen hundreds of houses become available on the Airbnb website for holiday use. The majority of these houses are in residential areas, and when they received planning permission it was on the basis that the properties would be for residential use only.”"},{"url":null,"title":"closure of drive in cinema for alleged covid 19 breaches baffling","story":"Minister to share his concerns with officials ‘to see whether we can do anything’. File photograph: GettyMinister for Communications Eamon Ryan has questioned how a drive-in movie business could be seen as a health risk for the spread of Covid-19 after Retro Drive-in Movies in Leopardstown, Dublin, was closed for alleged breaches of regulations.Mr Ryan will speak to Government colleagues “including officials dealing with the management of the public health crisis, to see whether anything can be done specifically in this instance”.He said it seemed “that drive-in movies would be as safe as we could get”. He and Minister for Arts Catherine Martin will have meetings next week about the reopening of the country and “she is very keen that cinemas and theatres will start to reopen in a safe way”. The Minister was responding to Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond who described the closure as “absolutely baffling”. The Dublin Rathdown TD said he had attended the drive-in cinemas last Friday and the closure was a surprise to the business itself as well as to customers.Mr Richmond said the closure of the cinema “makes absolutely no sense” when people can go to non-essential retail and the zoo, travel intercounty and visit people in gardens they cannot drive and watch a film from the safety of their car.He said that under statutory instrument or regulation 219 of 2021 Health Act 1947, “cinemas were listed as not permitted but drive-in cinemas were listed as an exception”.The Minister assured him he would share his concerns with officials “to see whether we can do anything”."},{"url":null,"title":"dogs can better detect covid in humans than lateral flow tests study","story":"‘Results are scientific confirmation of dogs’ capacity to detect the olfactory signature of Covid-19,’ according to Paris hospital board. Dogs are better at detecting coronavirus in humans than many fast lateral flow tests (LFTs), according to a French study which could mean canines are more widely deployed for mass virus screening in crowded places including airports.The trial, conducted in March and April by France’s national veterinary school and the clinical research unit of Paris’s Necker-Cochin hospital, showed dogs were able to detect the presence of the virus with 97 per cent accuracy.The dogs were also 91 per cent correct in identifying negative samples, the study showed. A recent review of 64 studies found LFTs correctly identify on average 72 per cent of people infected with the virus who have symptoms, and 58 per cent who do not.“These results are scientific confirmation of dogs’ capacity to detect the olfactory signature of Covid-19,” the Paris hospital board said, adding that the study - which is due to be published in a scientific review - was the first of its kind.“These are excellent results, comparable with those of a PCR test,” Prof Jean-Marc Treluyer told Agence-France Presse. He said dogs would not replace polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are significantly more reliable than LFT tests.But, he said, “they could help identify those people who should undergo a full viral test and – because the dogs’ response is so quick – facilitate mass testing” in places such as airports, train stations and concert venues.In the French study, researchers collected samples – cotton pads pressed for two minutes under participants’ armpits – from 335 people aged between six and 76 who presented themselves for a PCR test at testing centres in Paris.The pads were then sealed in jars and given to at least two of the nine dogs used in the trial – none of whom came into contact with the volunteers – to be sniffed. The dogs’ handlers did not know in advance which samples were positive.The dogs detected 97 per cent of the 109 people whose PCR test subsequently proved positive, and 91 per cent of those whose PCR test was negative.Researchers in countries including Australia, Germany and Britain have experimented with dogs to detect coronavirus, while Finland and the United Arab Emirates last year launched trials with sniffer dogs at Helsinki and Dubai international airports. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: AstraZeneca vaccine is 90pc effective, new real-world data suggestsBanksy loses second trademark case after refusing to disclose his identityMen with advanced prostate cancer set to be denied life-extending drugSniffer dogs better at testing for Covid than lateral flow tests, finds French trialDalian Atkinson trial: Pc accused of murder ‘was so terrified, he felt his brain wasn’t working’Comment: In saving Rhodes, the Government\u0026#39s war on woke has passed its first big testCovid lockdown roadmap: what you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions easeArchbishop of Canterbury offers ‘full, personal apology’ to victims of abusive summer camp leaderTactical votes for Scottish Greens may have cost Nicola Sturgeon overall majorityLady Nourse cleared of all 17 counts of abuse against young boy in 1980sBoris Johnson warned not to strike Australia trade deal that could \u0026#39decimate\u0026#39 British farmingBritish jets fire missiles at sea for first time in 15 years as new aircraft carriers deployedWatch: Why Prince Harry\u0026#39s outpourings about mental health may be doing more harm than goodTest and Trace failings ‘fuelled Indian variant surge’PIP breast implants scandal: thousands of British women in line for compensationMartin Bashir ‘deceived and induced’ Princess Diana’s brother to secure interview, BBC inquiry finds Shellfish behaviour lands Italian supermarket in court over sacked employee Comment: Britain cannot afford to become a bit-part player in the new Arctic battlegroundComment: With the pandemic ending, there is now zero excuse to ignore our economic woesBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fiona bruce questioned bbc chairmans praise womanising genius","story":"The chairman of the BBC was taken to task by Fiona Bruce after holding up a famously sexist US physicist as the epitome of genius.Richard Sharp’s praise for Richard Feynman, the late Nobel Laureate, raised eyebrows during a BBC event.Mr Sharp was taking part in an online Q\u0026ampA with staff, hosted by Bruce, when he spoke approvingly of Feynman’s achievements while acknowledging that he was a womaniser.Bruce, the Question Time host, responded by asking if Mr Sharp was advocating the womanising aspect of Feynman’s character. Mr Sharp assured her that he was not.In his memoir, Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman!, the physicist detailed the womanising ways of his youth and set out his early technique of seducing “worthless bitches”.An amateur artist, he produced a portrait of “a beautiful blonde woman” during a life drawing class and named it after Marie Curie, saying: “Nobody thinks of Madame Curie as a woman, as feminine, with beautiful hair, bare breasts and all that. They only think of the radium part.”Mr Sharp brought up Feynman’s name when a staff member taking part in the Q\u0026ampA asked him how he would define genius. The chairman directed staff to watch a 1981 BBC Horizon documentary, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.Feynman, who died in 1988, was regarded in his day as a great wit and brilliant mind. He was a member of the team that developed the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos and taught at the California Institute of Technology.In 1986, sitting on the Presidential Commission into the Challenger space shuttle disaster, he conducted an impromptu experiment during a committee hearing that succinctly explained how the accident had occurred.A BBC spokesperson said: “At an internal staff event, the chairman was asked about how to measure genius.

Yet despite the retreat of the pandemic in the face of a remarkably successful vaccination programme, the fear of a Covid upsurge continues to dominate debate around public health almost to the exclusion of all other considerations.The Prime Minister, who had been confident until recently that the “road map” to normality was on track, is now hedging his bets. Arguably the pace of the unlocking was already too cautious given the rapid decline in hospitalisations and fatalities – supposedly the two key metrics for deciding on the next steps.Where is any cost-benefit analysis of keeping these restrictions in place? Governments may legitimately take draconian action in the midst of a rapidly accelerating epidemic but it is unacceptable to continue with these constraints when the impact of the virus is both low and localised. Those who say the measures are justified in order to limit the risk of future infections need to ask themselves when this would end.Contingency plans that had been drawn up for dealing with pandemics were largely abandoned when the coronavirus hit. Lockdowns spread around the world from China and then Italy as hospitals came under massive pressure in some areas. But no one had ever carried out an assessment of the effect lockdowns would have on society beyond the public health benefit occasioned by keeping people apart.Fear of being blamed is at the heart of this. Dominic Cummings, the former No 10 aide, is promising to make startling revelations about what was done in the early stages of the pandemic when he appears before a select committee next week. As Clement Attlee once said of Harold Laski, a period of silence on his part would be welcome.Even though the most vulnerable people have been vaccinated, the Government’s concern appears to be the potential spread of a more virulent strain of Covid among the unvaccinated population, placing pressure once again on hospitals. But this should be addressed either by increasing capacity or developing triage procedures that allow people to be treated away from hospital.Moreover, why are the rules governing face coverings not being withdrawn? In America, where Covid rates are higher than here, Joe Biden has effectively bowed to the action already being taken by many US states and removed the requirement for vaccinated people to wear masks. Here, it is startling to see so few MPs in the Commons chamber, and for those who are there all to be masked, at a time when offices up and down the land are trying to get their employees to return to their desks. Vaccinated MPs who recently went into the chamber without a mask were upbraided by the Speaker who threatened to suspend the sitting. What example are our elected representatives setting? They are just projecting fear. If people want to carry on wearing masks, let them – but to insist that those who have been fully vaccinated must do so is perverse.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labour politicians oppose immigration enforcement have given","story":"Perhaps a previously under-discussed reason that Labour isn’t being taken seriously as a potential government is staring us in the face: far too many Labour politicians don’t take the prospect seriously themselves.Earlier this week, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow secretary of state for mental health (yet another shadow cabinet position distinguished by the fact that its occupant doesn’t shadow an actual cabinet minister), tweeted her unhappiness about a police operation that uncovered a couple of iniduals suspected of “migration offences”.She may have had a genuine grievance: why were immigration officers attending a police operation ostensibly aimed at clamping down on those who flout covid restrictions? As she commented later, “This looks like racial profiling”. But Dr Allin-Khan is a member of Keir Starmer’s front bench team. With Labour in the midst of an identity crisis, with traditional Labour voters (many of whom happen to believe immigration should be tightly regulated) looking sceptically at what Labour has to offer, she comes across – perhaps unfairly – as being sceptical of the merit of enforcing immigration law.Meanwhile in Scotland in the past week, Scottish Labour have been busy giving their support to any illegal immigrant who fancies staying put and ignoring immigration law. An attempt to remove two of them physically last week “disgusted” the party’s leader, Anas Sarwar, while one of his newly elected MSPs, Paul Sweeney, a former MP, endorsed the “civil disobedience” of the crowd of Glaswegians who forced police to release the two men who had chosen to stay here illegally after their visas expired.It should be pointed out that for those at whom these various expressions of solidarity were aimed will have welcomed them. Rather optimistically, Sweeney went on to say that the forced removal of migrants was opposed by a “majority” of Scots, but even dismissing this as wishful thinking on his part, there is a section of society only too happy to be told that they should stand up to The Man and that they should always get their own way, irrespective of the law.It’s when we dig deeper into these politicians’ roles that we start to unearth some serious questions and concerns. In the event of a Labour victory at the next general election, Dr Allin-Khan can expect to become a minister. At which point she will be bound by government collective responsibility. Since it is beyond unlikely that a government of any party could win the support of the electorate while insisting that all illegal immigrants can stay and work in the country whose laws they have spent years disrespecting, we must assume that the next Labour government, like all previous Labour governments, will be committed to enforcing immigration laws.It is as well that Dr Allin-Khan’s tenure as an MP has occurred during a period when elevation to government is only a remote prospect I doubt if she and many of her colleagues would have been comfortable as Labour MPs when her party was in government, when immigration detention centres were in full vigour and the party’s MPs – back benchers as well as ministers – regularly had to defend ministerial decisions that meant sending thousands of people back to their countries of origin against their will.Sarwar and Sweeney’s situation is doubtless a bit easier: MSPs have no responsibility whatsoever for immigration policy and are free to behave like student politicians if they wish, saying whatever their audience wants to hear and basking in their approval, if not their votes. Similarly, Scottish Labour’s self-indulgent decision to oppose Trident nuclear missiles was a popular position to take given that it’s MPs, not MSPs, who make defence decisions.Whatever the differences in political responsibilities, however, it is the common culture and attitude to difficult policy areas that still unite the disparate parts of the Labour Party. Both Scottish Labour and UK Labour have spent so long out of government that few, if any, of their respective front benches have any ministerial experience. They’ve chosen to forget the inconvenient truth that being in government sometimes means having to stand up in front of hostile crowds and tell them they are wrong and the government is right. And then they have to vote for unpopular things in the Commons.Opposition does that to politicians they stop seeing themselves as potential governors and start seeing themselves instead as mere ciphers for whoever in their communities have the loudest voices. That makes life a lot easier.And right there is the problem: too many of our elected opposition politicians want an easy life, where everyone likes them and everyone agrees with them. And the more distant becomes the prospect of one day getting into government, the more tempting it is to indulge the opinions of the last person who sat on you. And so a vicious cycle begins: no prospect of government means MPs feel free to indulge in more populist commentary, while more populist statements make the prospect of winning an election ever less likely. And so on.The tactic feels like it’s working because that comfortable echo chamber seems to like what you say. But then, come election night, you’re reminded that other people, the sort who don’t necessarily come along to town hall meetings or use social media, also have a vote. And when reality bites you have a choice: either be seen as a serious politician with serious, uncomfortable truths to impart, or carry on as you were, lapping up the approval of a tiny percentage of the electorate.The choice seems to have been made already by too many in Labour.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pandemic ending now zero excuse ignore economic woes","story":"Something seems to have gone missing from the public discourse on Covid-19: money. True, in the depths of the first lockdown anyone who dared bring up the subject of the horrific cost of closing down the economy for weeks on end was quickly put down with meaningless platitudes like “life is too important for money” - as if money were just some abstract parlour game rather than a means by which limited resources can be allocated to healthcare and other competing needs. But at least we had some sort of debate. Now, the government tells us to cancel our summer holidays and suggests it might delay the planned 21 June lifting of most Covid restrictions – and hardly anyone dares even mention the cost in jobs and extra public debt.In a few off-the-cuff comments ministers have just condemned the tourism industry to a second lost season – an industry which until a few days ago was gearing itself for the lifting of a ban on foreign holidays. Outbound tourism, according to ABTA, is an industry worth £11.7 billion a year to the UK economy. Did that even enter Matt Hancock’s head when he said this week - contrary to what most people understood - that Britons should still consider themselves barred from amber-list countries unless they are on some desperate mission such as going to care for a dying relative?There was a time when the economy was central to everything the government did. Unemployment figures, trade figures, economic growth governments lived or died by such measures. Yet the current administration has redefined its role as one overwhelmingly concerned with one thing: keeping Covid infections low. As for the economy, it seems to take the attitude that it can look after itself – even when many economic activities have been banned by the state. As soon as restrictions are lifted, goes the thinking, we’ll have such a huge rebound that everything will be okay. The government’s resolve to ignore the economy was bolstered by the Bank of England upgrading its forecast for UK economic growth in 2021 from five per cent to 7.25 per cent.Yet, less noticed, the Bank simultaneously reduced its forecast for 2022 by a similar amount. Moreover, even if the economy does grow by 7.25 per cent this year it will still be smaller than it was at the beginning of February 2020. On 31 March we still had 4.2 million on furlough – or unemployed by another name. Many of these jobs will be gone for good, but we just don’t know it yet. The government is nursing a £303 billion deficit. Inflation has doubled in a month to 1.5 per cent as a wave of printed money runs up against a wall of reduced productive capacity. The latter poked its way into the headlines this week, but only briefly between scary government briefings over the Indian variant.    At the beginning of this year there was huge confidence that the government’s vaccination programme – for which it has rightly won plaudits – was going to give Britain a headstart in economic recovery. In Britain life would be back to normal while other countries were still battling outbreaks. But any advantage that we had has been thrown away by the government’s refusal to open up sooner. Denmark may have been delayed in its vaccination programme, which contributed to a blip in cases in March, yet still it is planning to lift most Covid restrictions on 8 June - two weeks ahead of Britain’s now-threatened full reopening.Yet just where is the Indian variant crisis? Whether it has greater transmissibility or not, the seven day average of Covid infections is actually down over the week - not that you would guess from the tone of government pronouncements, which give the impression of a new terror rampant in the land, so deadly that it has rendered the massive vaccination programme worthless.But hey, lives are more important than money. We’ll find out how true that is when we have several million unemployed, poverty is rising and our cancer wards start to fill up with people who could have been cured, but now cannot, thanks to their being too scared to seek treatment while the government is obsessed about new variants. As we will find out eventually, there is no hard choice between lives and money. The loss of the former is very often closely related to a lack of the latter.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"progressive democrats pressure joe biden get tough israel amid","story":"US President Joe Biden is facing pressure from within his own party to take a tougher stance on Israel as progressive Democrats call for the cancellation of a $735 million arms deal amid ongoing fighting with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Pocan and Rashida Tlaib introduced a resolution Wednesday seeking to block American arms company Boeing selling precision-guided weapons to Israel, in a sale approved by the Biden administration earlier this month. The symbolic measure, which has at least six other co-sponsors including some of the most Left-leaning Democrats in the House, was unlikely to pass but signals Israel’s changing relationship with its most powerful ally, following four years of unconditional US support under former president Donald Trump. The harsh truth is that these weapons are being sold by the United States to Israel with the clear understanding that the vast majority of them will be used to bomb Gaza, added Ms Tlaib, who is of Palestinian origin.She was seen in deep conversation with Mr Biden on Tuesday afternoon, where she reportedly urged him to end US military support for Israel.  This new relationship appears to be reflected in changing public opinion, with a recent Gallup poll finding that 34 per cent of Americans support putting pressure on Israel, a new high. The resolution came after the president told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to immediately wind down fighting with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has so far killed over 200 people. It came after days in which Mr Biden declined to call for a ceasefire.“The President conveyed to the Prime Minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire,” the White House said Wednesday in an account of Mr Biden’s fourth call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the fighting erupted last Monday.It was the first time the president had publicly pressured the Israeli leader to implement a ceasefire and the three-sentence statement differed from previous readouts by omitting usual references to Israel’s right to defend itself and by giving a timeframe for action. Later White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One:  “The United States is working tirelessly through various levels of government to express support for a cease-fire, get to a place of sustainable calm, and build a path forward to addressing the underlying causes of conflict.”She added: “The two leaders had a detailed discussion on the state of events in Gaza, the Israelis progress in degrading the capabilities of Hamas and other terrorist elements, and ongoing diplomatic efforts by regional governments and the United States.”But Mr Biden’s statements are unlikely to satisfy the Left wing of his party, which has urged him to push harder to end the violence, in which thousands of militant rocket attacks on civilian areas of Israel have been met with air strikes that have killed dozens of Palestinian civilians.The sale of the Boeing Joint Direct Attack Munitions is likely to go ahead, with most Republicans and Democrats in Congress still supporting strong support for Israel, which is the largest beneficiary of US foreign aid, receiving some $3.8 billion a year.Republicans have accused Mr Biden of bowing to pressure within his party to abandon a longstanding ally. “Today he said he expects a significant de-escalation from Israel,” said Senator Tom Cotton. “What he needs to say is that he expects Iran and Hamas to stop terrorising the people of Israel.”Senator Jerry Moran said it is “shocking to me to see how much the administration has changed over time in regard to support for Israel.”  But the fact that the weapons sale was not even in question before the start of the fiercest fighting in years erupted last Monday suggests that Israel may be relying on qualified American support for the first time in years. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu plan unvaccinated brits holidays","story":"NewsEU plan to let in unvaccinated Brits for holidays could be threatened by Indian iantThe EU has agreed to expand its whitelist of countries from which anyone can travel - but we still dont knowBritain will be on itmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY NewsBrits boarding an Easyjet flight at Londons Gatwick Airport \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The European Council today agreed to expand a “whitelist” of nations from which holidaymakers without both doses can travel. But there are still doubts over whether Britain will make it onto the list - despite passing one of the key tests to get on it. The Council agreed to raise the cut-off point for whitelist countries from  cases per , to  per ,. The UK’s rate is around  - low enough to make the cut.However, the Council has also added “iants of interest or concern” to the checklist before a country can be deemed safe. That could become a sticking point for the UK, where around , cases of the Indian iant have been found so far. The whitelist is expected be announced in the coming days and will be reviewed every two weeks. According to The Times, Britain could be held off the whitelist at first and only added when it is updated in two weeks’ time. An EU ambassador told the newspaper: “It makes sense to kick the can down the road to see the latest numbers and data to assess whether the surge has levelled off. Countries will also be checked for the trend of new cases, the number of tests performed, a % or lower positivity rate, the overall response to Covid and that country’s approach to EU nationals.  The whitelist is separate to the EU’s plans to let in fully-vaccinated tourists no matter where they’re from, which were also approved by the Council today. Any changes risk adding even more confusion for Brits, thousands of whom are already planning holidays against UK advice. Most European countries are still on the UK’s “amber” own list - meaning Brits would have to quarantine when they get home, regardless of what rules apply in the EU. On top of this, inidual EU countries are able to decide their own rules on top of recommendations from the Council. For example, Portugal is allowing entry to unvaccinated Brits as long as they pass a health screening and go through Covid testing.  It comes as more than a quarter of a million passengers will fly from the UK to amber list countries by the weekend – despite ministersapos desperate pleas not to travel. Up to , people are due to jet to nations such as Spain, Greece and Italy, according to an analysis for The Daily . It found more than , flights are scheduled to fly to amber list countries in the five days to Sunday at a rate of up to , passengers daily. Following days of mixed Government messages, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged sunseekers not to jet to amber countries. He told the BBC: The amber list and the red list are not for holidaymakers, thataposs not the purpose of those lists at this time. “We just think that after a year of lockdowns in this country, of people coming forward in record numbers to get their vaccines, we do not want to be in a position of taking risks at this stage about our unlock. An amber list country was not free and open travel and we ask people not to go to these places for holidays, he added. The Cabinet Minister begged Britons to wait longer before jetting off. Our message is very straightforward, which is, aposJust a little bit of patience, everyoneapos,”,he said. I know itaposs been an incredibly tough year and there are extreme circumstance where people will feel that it is the right thing to do – perhaps because they have a sick family member and some extreme situations where theyaposll travel in the orange category. “But by and large we are just asking people to be a little bit patient as other countries catch up with our world-leading vaccination programme and then people will be able to, I hope, travel.” He offered hope that more nations would be deemed safe for quarantine-free travel as the summer marched on.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnThe TimesEuropean UnionBBCEuropean CouncilGrant Shapps"},{"url":null,"title":"test trace glitch helped india","story":"NewsTest and trace glitch helped India iant surge in one of worst hit areasThe Government has admitted there had been a delay in people who had been in contact with hundreds of others who had tested positive for Covid- in BlackburnmirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe government has admitted the glitch meant hundreds of cases werent notied to local authorities \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And according to the BBC, a government report revealed for three weeks in April and May, eight local authorities in England did not have access to full data on positive tests in their area. In total  positive tests across the eight areas were not reported. There are now almost , cases of the India iant of Covid- in the UK - a jump of % in just two days.

The Prime Ministeraposs Official Spokesman admitted the breakdown had taken place. He said: There was a short delay in asking some of those positive cases to provide details of iniduals they had contacted since contracting Covid. This issue was across a small number of local authority areas and was quickly resolved. A government spokesman told the BBC people who had been in contact with those who had tested positive had experienced a temporary delay in getting a message from NHS Test and Trace According to the BBC, the outage lasted from April  to May  - when the system only provided details of a limited number of positive cases. The areas affected by the glitch included Blackburn with Darwen - where the number of missing cases was highest. It also included Blackpool, York, Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock. A report by officials at one of the affected councils, seen by the BBC, said the system failed to noty staff of cases, meaning their contacts could not be traced. It read: the rapid spread of Indian iant cases... may be partially or largely attributable to risks in the international travel control system - adding: These were exacerbated by the sporadic failure of the national Test and Trace system. Asked whether the Government accepted the failure contributed to the spread of the iant, the PMaposs spokesman said: The spread of the iant will be down to a number of factors - this was an issue that occurred across a small number of local authority areas, so I donapost think it is possible to draw that conclusion from this.

So what about the crucial question for passengers - what this reform will actually mean for ticket prices and your wallet   Despite finding fares have shot up % in real terms since , and only % of passengers think their journey is value for money, today’s -page report makes absolutely no promise to make tickets cheaper. There’s a lot of tinkering with the system to make it simpler - and therefore, you might argue, cheaper for those who’d been stung by expensive fares before. Next month there’ll also be a fares boost for part-time commuters. But overall, a lot of the eye-watering ticket prices we see on the network might end up staying the same. Dan Bloom runs through what the review promises - and what it doesn’t. What is the reform going to do  Until now, most rail services have been run by private firms awarded franchises by the Government.  The Williams-Shapps Plan for Railsets up a new public body called Great British Railways . It will take over responsibility for managing infrastructure, issuing contracts to train operators, setting fares and selling tickets. This is a much wider responsibility than the public body Network Rail, which manages the track at the moment and will be absorbed into GBR.  Passenger numbers have soared since train operation was privatised in the mid-s, but there’s been a deluge of complaints about quality and cost. The review was triggered by those complaints and the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May , which exposed “no one in charge” of the network. Rail franchises were then effectively ended when the Government took over the financial risks of operators in March  to keep services running due to Covid. But this is not an end to privatisation. GBR will award contracts to private firms to run trains, with incentives based on performance and passenger numbers. Will it actually make my tickets cheaper  Ah. Here’s the tricky part. No, not exactly. There has been no commitment for an overall reduction in fares. And indeed, Grant Shapps refused to promise they’ll rise by inflation or less in future years. Instead, the Government has pledged to simply the fares system and offer digital ticketing and more flexibility. In theory, that will make things cheaper , say, you were bamboozled by the system and got ripped off before. But overall, it’s very woolly. Mr Shapps warned railways are already subsidised and taxpayers plugged a £bn Covid hole. He also warned “there’ll be no instant changes” to fare prices and this will be a “multi-year change”. And today’s report says: “It is not possible to continue paying revenue support inde nitely on the present scale, around four times the amount provided before the pandemic.” The new contracts will have a string of requirements on train firms - including punctuality, reliability, passenger satisfaction, capacity, staff availability and helpfulness, customer information, vandalism repair, passenger satisfaction, “revenue protection” and cleanliness.Not a single one of those requirements is to actually make the fares cheaper.  OK, so how *might* it make fares cheaper  If you’re feeling generous, you’d say the overall reforms to simply the system might make things cheaper in the long run. It’s claimed the overall reforms could save £.bn a year after five years - equal to % of all income from fares. Reforms including ditching the legal departments arguing over what sized bird hit a power cable and therefore who’s responsible. But there’s no suggestion this cost saving will be passed on to passengers via a cut in ticket prices.  Meanwhile, the report says: “On long-distance services, where operators will have more commercial freedom, including more control over fare setting, a greater range of book-ahead tickets will be offered. “These will help to end the sudden clfs in prices that passengers can encounter at dferent times of day.” It also says the dference between peak and off-peak could reduce. “If commuter demand permanently and signi cantly reduces, some of the assumptions around the peak timetable and charging structure may change.” And how might it *not* make fares cheaper  The report explicitly says some firms will be allowed to “act more commercially” on some services as passenger numbers tick up. “Operators on those routes, predominantly the long-distance ones, will be able to make more decisions including setting more of their own fares and taking more revenue risk,” it says. The report says “affordable walk-up fares” will be preserved “as now”. But many passengers faced with eye-watering on the day costs will claim this is nonsense, and they should be cheaper than they are now.  What is the one instant change to fares  New flexible season tickets will be introduced from June , ready for use from June . They can be used for travel on any eight days in a -day period - making things cheaper for commuters who go in for two to three days per week. The Department for Transport claims this will save part-time commuters hundreds of pounds per year compared with buying daily tickets. What other changes to tickets will there be  There will also be a signicant rollout of more pay-as-you-go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones, the Department for Transportsaid. More areas will have contactless pay-as-you-go ticketing like London’s Oyster card, which takes payments out of a balance using fare zones. And anywhere in the country you should be able to use a digital ticket on a smartphone app. Private firms will be able to combine rail travel with other services such as hiring bikes, booking hotel rooms or experiences like sports and concert tickets.Rather than making fares cheaper, this could make them easier to use and navigate - and to get the cheapest fare on offer. The announcement that GBR will sell tickets led to shares in retailer Trainline plunging by more than % in early trading, wiping around £ million off its value. Will the new system make my train run on time  There will be incentives to do so - but nothing’s guaranteed. The Government believes scrapping the franchise system will lead to operators being more focused on improving services. The new concession model is similar to the one successfully used by Transport for London for its London Overground and Docklands Light Railway networks. Ministers also hope there will be a smoother link in the management of train and track. When will I actually see a dference  Not soon. “I can’t pretend that suddenly instantly just because we’re changing the name the trains will run on time,” Mr Shapps admitted. It’s already taken years for this plan to be agreed, and GBR is not expected to be established until . Passenger watchdog Transport Focus said passengers will welcome this move towards a more accountable and joined up railway. But the announcement was criticised by trade unions, with the Transport Salaried Staffsapos Association describing it as an attempt merely to paper over the cracks. Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said: “Nearly three years after it was commissioned, this report raises more questions than it answers. “With fare hikes, £ billion cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it’s yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGrant ShappsDepartment for TransportAppsRailwaysSmartphones"},{"url":null,"title":"woman who lost two children","story":"NewsMenopausal woman who lost two children and miscarried twice welcomes baby at EXCLUSIVE: Karen Seaton and her partner Rich suffered their fair share of tragedy in trying to conceive, but just as they were about to give up hope, they received the most wonderful surprisemirrorShareCommentsByJessica Taylor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsKaren Seaton has opened up about raising a toddler while going through menopause\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

At , Karen had three sons from another relationship and Rich adored them. But the pair felt they had room for one more in their brood. However, after falling pregnant twice and miscarrying both times, Karen’s mental health was suffering. “It was horrendous. I lost both pregnancies fairly late and Rich and I were struggling,” Karen, now , told The Mirror. The miscarriages brought back painful memories for Karen, who had already suffered the loss of two daughters when she was in her s and with her first husband. Mari, her first daughter, suffered complications in the womb and didn’t survive childbirth. A few years later Georgia came along, but she tragically died at four and a half months old.  Just  at the time, Karen was devastated to learn she and her husband couldn’t conceive successfully after post-mortems revealed both girls had a genetic heart condition. Both desperate for a family, the couple amicably parted ways. “We’re still friends today. We went through so much together and will always have that bond,” Karen says. In time, she remarried and had three sons George, Harry and Archie. After Archie was born, Karen’s  year marriage broke down and she became a single mum, with the boys visiting their dad on weekends. “It was absolute chaos in my household,” she joked. “I was barely ever in the house for all the running around I did!” Then, seven years ago, she connected with an old family friend, Rich. “I’d known Rich since we were kids but we’d lost touch. After his marriage ended we got back in touch and ended up in a relationship,” she explained.  “I thought I was done with kids - in fact, they weren’t even on my radar, but Rich didn’t have any children of his own. “I decided: ‘Let’s try and see what happens’.” To Karen’s surprise, she fell pregnant in her s. But things weren’t to be, and the pair were heartbroken to discover she’d miscarried. After picking themselves up to try again, they were dealt another blow with a second miscarriage. “I put it down to my age, but we were really low,” she described. “It was starting to affect our relationship. “By now I was  and losing hope. I decided to set myself a deadline for my th birthday. If I wasn’t pregnant by then, it wasn’t going to happen for us.” After the final month of trying, Karen bought a pregnancy test. When it came back positive, she was stunned. But instead of worrying about another miscarriage, a wave of calm washed over her. “I just had this gut feeling everything would work out this time,” she told The Mirror. But despite feeling cool about the pregnancy, Karen was less laid back about telling the boys her news.  “I didn’t know how they’d react. We put some scan photos into envelopes for them to open and waited for their reaction.” Luckily, the boys were thrilled at the idea of having a little sister. After a visit to her GP, Karen was prescribed hormone medication to help the pregnancy go as smoothly as possible, as she’d had her thyroid removed a few years earlier. In time, miracle baby Mia was born and Karen’s brood was complete. After a one month stay in hospital for a respiratory condition, Mia recovered fully and thrived with three big brothers to dote on her. “I was a dferent mum the second time around. I was so much more chilled out,” she said, citing breastfeeding as an example. “Mia was being fed through a tube for the first month of her le so once she was out of hospital, it made more sense to bottle feed her. “I breastfed all the boys and I know I’d have been upsetI couldn’t do that. But with Mia, I was older and more experienced, so I knew she had to be fed and that was the most important thing.” In between juggling kids and work with handling menopause symptoms, Karen also finds time to run an Instagram page, @tryingmybestoldermumma and write a blog.Karen told The Mirror: “I started the Instagram page because I realised there weren’t many voices of older mums out there. “Since starting it up, I’ve had so many older mums reach out to thank me for being open with my story.” One issue Karen touches on through her Instagram page is raising a toddler while going through menopause, which started when she was  and Mia was two. “I can’t tellmy exhaustion is normal from raising a child ormenopause is a factor,” she said. “I’m lucky in that I’ve not had mood swings, but I get hot flushes and night sweats. “I also have brain fog sometimes so I have to make to-do lists every day!” Mia is now three years old and is doing well. “She’s such a good child. She sleeps through the night and she’s so happy all the time,” Karen gushed. Big brothers George, Harry and Archie are now ,  and , and they’re incredibly protective of their baby sister. “They absolutely adore her,” Karen said, adding that their dad even buys gts for Mia at Christmas. There have been times when Karen has worried about her age, but she brushes off any doubts. “I am very aware that I’m the oldest mum on the school run and sometimes I worry that Mia might get teased for having an older mum. I also wish my energy levels were a bit higher to run around after her. “But Mia is a blessing and I’m so lucky to have her. I feel like I’ve got my happy ending.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBabiesPregnancyMiscarriageMenopause"},{"url":null,"title":"brit trampled stampeding wild rhino","story":"NewsBrit trampled by stampeding wild rhino in South Africa relives terrying encounterScottish student Kieran Munns, , spoke from his hospital bed as he recovers after the horror attack by a stampeding rhino in Northern Zululand, South AfricamirrorShareCommentsByJon HebditchReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsKieran has vowed to never stop helping animals in need.\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Scots student Kieran Munns said he is recovering after the horror attack in Northern Zululand, South Africa on Wednesday. The -year-old, whose family are from Livingston, has been studying in the country for the past two years at Bhejane Nature Training, and had hoped to join a special team protecting the beasts.Kieran was carrying out a foot patrol when the animal charged at him and he somehow emerged without serious injuries, he told the Daily Record.The student said he suffered a bang on the head after one of the massive animals attacked and was then trampled on by the mother rhinoaposs young calf.  A search and rescue operation was launched and paramedics rushed Kieran to hospital - but he has vowed to never stop helping animals in need. Speaking from his hospital bed in Africa, Kieran described how he would continue in his conservation efforts and held no grudges against rhinos after the incident. He said: I have been studying in South Africa for almost two years and had the opportunity to be part of the rhino monitoring team for the morning.  This is an important part of rhino conservation for which I am passionate and want to be heavily involved. Itaposs true that unfortunately the encounter turned ugly due [to] unfortunate but uncontrollable circumstances and was I injured. But nothing more than a bang to the head from falling from the mother and my hip getting injured by being stepped on by a young calf which was with the mother black rhino. No serious injuries have occurred. Iaposm not fighting for my le, no surgery is needed and Iaposm making a rapid recovery. I absolutely love what I do and have no negative feelings towards the innocent and how it was dealt with, I still love and adore all animals including black rhino and look forward to being back in the field as soon as Iaposm able. My colleagues have been exceptional.  He added: Of course itaposs scary in the moment, but I have no negative thoughts about the whole incident and super keen to get back out there. A post on social media from the IPSS medical rescue service said that he was being treated at Zulu-Natal hospital. It read: A Scottish student has been critically injured following an encounter with a black rhino, in Northern Zululand. IPSS Medical Rescue was contacted and informed that the game ranger student had been on foot in a private reserve when he was trampled and gored by the rhino. The incident occurred earlier today and prompted a search and rescue operation by IPSS Search and Rescue as well as anti-poaching units in the area. The student was located and preparations for evacuation were initiated. The student was stabilised before being transported in a critical condition by road, by KZN Private EMS. Kieran publicly thanked his rescuers and assured everyone he was ok. He commented: Hi my name is Kieran Iaposm the student who was involved in the incident. I want to say a HUGE thank you to everyone who was involved, itaposs heartwarming to see people who are willing to help the way you guys did. All is well thank the Lord, no serious injuries and could potentially be let out later today.

Black rhinos can be fearsome creatures that live throughout large swathes of Africa and can weigh up to  stones. When they attract an unusual scent they will often charge, according to National Geographic. Bad eye sight can lead them to charging objects like trees thinking they are threats. Sadly they are a favourite of poachers who value their horns and they are listed as aposcritically endangeredapos.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHospitalsRhinosAnimals"},{"url":null,"title":"easyjet ryanair among firms flogging","story":"NewsEasyJet and Ryanair among firms flogging travel to amber list countries despite warningsAfter mixed messaging from the government, seven of the UKs  biggest travel firms are offering holidays to amber list countries, as well as airlines easyJet and RyanairmirrorShareCommentsByMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video hancock-urges-people-jab-indian-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:EKVuovd,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Analysis has show seven of the UKaposs biggest  travel firms are offering trips to amber list countries, as well as budget airlines Ryanair and easyJet, seemingly in the face of government advice. Some companies have slashed prices by half and Ryanair is offering plane tickets for as little as £ in a bid to get business moving again after a torrid year of lockdowns and travel bans. Holiday favourites Spain, Greece, Italy and France are all currently on the governmentaposs amber list of destinations, meaning holidaymakers must quarantine for  days on ing and take two pricey Covid tests. EasyJet and Ryanair have confirmed that seats are selling, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has told people not to travel - while refusing to actually ban trips to amber list countries. The mixed messages have left Brits with holidays already booked facing losing hundreds of poundsthey cannot isolate for  days afterwards. Some firms are refusing refunds or charging large rebooking fees for trips to non-red list countries.How have your holiday plans been affected  Email webnews@mirror One nurse claimed she was £ out of pocket having had to change the dates of Ryanair flights to an amber list country because she couldnapost get time off work to self-isolate. Last night Ryanair CEO Michael OaposLeary said that people had been booking in their droves for the past four weeks. The budget airline launched a flash sale yesterday running to midnight tonight with dozens of flights on offer for just £. While the list of cut price destinations including Bologna, Barcelona and Bratislava may be tempting, the price of testing before and after the getaway bumps the cost up by several hundred pounds per person. Big deals are also up for grabs through easyJet, where the companies low-fare finder tool offers summer getaways to a whole host of destinations not on the green list. For just £. Brits can fly from London Gatwick to Agadir in Morocco this August, or from Bristol to Bodrum, Turkey for £.. EasyJet has not launched any specic promotions to amber list destinations but regular flights are available. When askedeasyJet customers were flying to amber countries for leisure despite Government guidance, easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren replied: Yes, people are booking flights and theyaposre going there on holidays.  Package holiday firms are also getting in on the action after months of business-stling travel bans. Tui has a host of deals including a trip to the Blue Lagoon Resort in Kos, Greece for seven nights at the beginning of June. The travel behemoth has slashed the sticker price from £, to £ per person. You could also spend a week in the sparkling blue waters of Fuerteventura, Spain where an all inclusive stay at TUI MAGIC LIFE is down to £ from £. Unlike easyJet and Ryanair however, Tui has stopped all trips to red and amber list countries until June , when a review of the countries by the government is due. According to Which , seven of the ten biggest holiday companies are flogging holidays to amber list countries this month or in early June.  They were TUI, easyJet Holidays, British Airways Holidays, Expedia, Lastminute, Virgin and Travel Republic. The hot deals on offer to amber list countries highlight a problem at the centre of the governmentaposs traffic light system, which came into force on Monday. Only  countries are on the green list, while most of Europe is amber - meaning passengers arriving back in the UK are required to self-isolate for  days and take two expensive Covid tests. Rather than ban trips to amber countries altogether, the government has simply pleaded with people to only make the journeysthey need to. All the while cheap flights to sun doused beaches and bargain package holidays are being sold, with as many as ,, people expected to fly out of the UK to amber list countries by Sunday. Yesterday Matt Hancock, Health Secretary, told the Commons that government advice was very clear - that people should not travel to amber or red-list countries or territories...for a holiday. Unfortunately he was undermined by Environment Secretary George Eustice, who said the amber destinations were for people who wanted to visit family or friends. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later claried that countries in the category should only be visited for some extreme circumstance, such as the serious illness of a family member.Such mixed messaging was no good for the thousands of Brits with holidays booked to amber countries who now face signicant losses however. Those heading to red list destinations are entitled to a full refund because the travel firm will be forced to cancel. The same is not true for amber list countries, eventhe tripaposs purpose flies in the face of one or more of the many bits of the governmentaposs advice. Tracey Godfrey is one of those people out of pocket. I booked through a travel agent and have cancelled my holiday due to it being on the amber list, cannot travel for leisure purposes, she tweeted at Ryanair.  I tried to change the dates of the holiday but you are charging £ flight operator fees. I booked this holiday in June . Another woman, who works as a nurse, said the airline was asking for £ to change flights to Majorca - something she may be forced to do due to being unable to isolate for ten days because of her work. Lisa Tones was in a similar position, explaining: I’m wanting to change my flights from June  to June  to Rome. I’m not wanting to cancel just move the date, so why am I being asked to pay another £ to do this when Rome is still in amber  Shocking. Mr Shapps urged travel firms to be flexible to customers facing problems as a result of restrictions.  He told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: I just appeal to the holiday companies, and there is protection in place for particularly package holidays through the Atol system, to be as flexible as possible and as helpful as possible. It is, I know, a frustrating situation as we all sit here, frankly, and wait to see what the virus does next.He acknowledged that thereaposs no doubt at all that coronavirus has made le impossibly dficult not just for holidaymakers but for travel companies as well.On Times Radio, Mr Shapps said an amber list country was not free and open travel and we ask people not to go to these places for holidays. So travel companies who stick to that and refuse to rebook, I would suggest are not in the right place.  A Tui spokesperson said: We want to offer our customers flexibility and choice this summer, so where borders are open and FCDO advice allows travel, we will operate to those destinations. We review our holiday cancellations in line with the Government updates every three weeks, with the next update due in early June. We know some customers may be unsure about travelling this summer, so we’ve offered free changes  days before travel for anyone due to travel before the end of August. They added that for customers going to amber destinations who cancel instead of choosing another date, their normal terms and conditions apply. All red and amber destinations where the government advise against all but essential travel, are cancelled up to and including  June , the spokesperson continued. Customers impacted have been contacted and can request a full cash refund, or to change to a later date or alternative holiday with a booking incentive. A Fly Virgin spokesperson said “We’re continuously reviewing our holiday schedules in response to the ongoing impact of Covid- restrictions. Currently, with the exception of Barbados trips, all package holidays up to and including  June have been cancelled and customers have been contacted. An Expedia spokesperson said: For summer travel – both domestic and international – the main advice we would give is to book with flexibility. Accommodation can easily be filtered to show free cancellation, and many airlines are now offering tickets with built-in flexibility, so you can change your travel dates or destinationsnecessary. An easyJet spokesperson said: We’re currently offering market leading flexible policies, including providing all customers with the option to transfer their flights to another date or destination fee free, up to two hours before departure.

Then there have been times when I’ve had crushes on certain girls, only for those crushes to die upon finding out about her past or current ­experiences. Long story short, I keep searching for someone to share something special with, only to find that all I can be is just another notch on someone’s bedpost.I understand that jealousy is normal, and I definitely have insecurities.What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  But I’d rather live with my insecurities than be with a girl who’s not a virgin, because I won’t be happy and, by extension, she won’t be either. I would be doing a disservice to myself and her by “settling”, especially considering she would most likely be a dream girl for someone . So, here I am, by myself, wonderingthere’s any chance at all that I’ll find what I’m looking for. Is there hope  Or am I on a wild goose chase here  Coleen saysOK, what’s behind this need  It doesn’t sound like it’s for religious reasons.It is almost like being a virgin is the top priority for you and crucial factors like character, personality, chemistry, passion and friendship are way down the list. I’d suggest you need to think about what a relationship is and adjust your priorities and expectations. You could meet a virgin tomorrow and she might be wrong for you in every other way, so the relationship would fail.

If she’s right for you, she’ll understand and sex will happen naturally – and it will be a lot of fun learning! You’re overthinking what will make you happy and you’re  steps ahead of yourself. I believe what will make you happy is to find a girl you connect with and fall in love with, regardless of whether she’s a virgin or not.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnColeen NolanRelationships"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park.

Health authorities around the world have been forced to tackle anti-vaxxer sentiment and conspiracy theories. Only recently, fears of blood clots linked to the Oxford AstraZeneca jab briefly plunged Europeaposs vaccine rollout in crisis - and some say damaged confidence.The World Health Organisation, UK, and European medicines regulators have all assured the AstraZeneca jab is safe and the risk of clots minuscule.The experts concluded the jabaposs benefits outweigh its risks following a series of safety reviews.But some leaders, including Franceaposs Emmanuel Macron, have been criticised for briefly suspending the shot. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. A recent survey by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research found % said they would refuse a jab in December, dropping to % by May - but still not as low as the % last June who said they would reject a shot. In the UK, under-s are able to opt for another vaccine, such as Pfizer or Moderna, instead of AstraZenecaaposs shot.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is under fire for not shutting the borders to India earlier as a new iant devastates the country - sparking fears it could threaten the UKaposs roadmap out of lockdown. Broadcaster LBC revealed this week more than  flights had been allowed from India since it had been added to the governmentaposs travel aposred list.apos The Indian iant is spreading in the UK, prompting surge testing in hotspots including Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, and Bedford. Scientists this week said at this stage they do not believe the iant causes more severe illness and does not appear resistant to available vaccines. But its emergence in Britain has sparked fears the plans to lt most restrictions on June  could be delayedthe iantaposs spread is not curbed.  What exactly did Matt Hancock say  The Health Secretary appeared to blame the fresh surge in cases in Bolton on vaccine hesitancy on Monday. The town is recording the highest Covid infection rates in the country, and leading the tables for Indian iant cases.The most recent Public Health England figures show  cases of the iant are in Bolton, where it is now making up .% of total cases,  are in Blackburn with Darwen, where it makes up .%,  are in Seftonand  are in Bedford . Mr Hancock told MPs in the House of Commons that the majority of people admitted to hospital in Bolton had been eligible for the jab but had not taken it up. Mr Hancock said there were now , confirmed cases of the Indian iant in the UK , of which  were in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. He told MPs on Monday  people in the Royal Bolton Hospital have the virus. The majority have not been vaccinated and, of them, most of them could have been vaccinated, which is frustrating to see, but is also a message to everyone, Mr Hancock said. It just reinforces the message that people should come forward and get vaccinated because that is the best way to protect everybody. Bolton NHS Foundation Trust declined to comment, referring the Mirror to official vaccinations data. But what do the experts say  Dr Zubaida Haque, a member of independent Sage, said vaccine hesitancy was being used as a red herring by the government. She told Good Morning Britain: The Health Secretary has suggested that this is about vaccine hesitancy, but at the moment his conclusion seems to be based on hospitalisations in Bolton of  people, of which a third have been vaccinated.  Now heaposs suggesting that of the  or  they didnapost have their vaccine when they were offered, but we donapost know why they didnapost take up their vaccine - it may have been medical reasons, it may have been other reasons. This whole notion that, that at the moment, everyoneaposs freedom is threatened because of vaccine hesitancy groups, is absolute nonsense. The main threat at the moment is thisiant is highly transmissible - itaposs % more transmissible than the Kent iant - and it is rapidly spreading across the country. Dr Haque, who is a former deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, added: The problem is at the moment vaccine hesitancy is being used as a red herring. Absolutely everybody should take vaccinations because it reduces severe disease, and it will take the pressure off the NHS. But there was a key issue here which is, how is the Government going to stop the spread of this iant  It takes a while to roll out this vaccine, weaposve still got millions and millions of people who havenapost had either the second dose or any dose at all. Itaposs going to take a couple of months but we canapost wait a couple of months so what  is the Government doing now  How many people in the UK are rejecting vaccines  Frankly, itaposs too soon to say. The UKaposs vaccine rollout is not complete, so we donapost know the full picture yet while the jabs are only now getting to younger adults. But there are two sets of official data that can help give us some clues about the scale of vaccine hesitancy right now. It is important to note some people reject or delay vaccines for health reasons on the advice of their doctors - for instance, because they are immunocompromised. The Office for National Statisticsis tracking vaccine uptake in two ways - looking at the numbers who have turned down a jab already, and surveying peopleaposs attitudes.  Because elderly and vulnerable people were first in the jabs queue, the ONS data measuring actual vaccine uptake rates currently only covers over-s.It found .% of all residents in England aged  years and over had received at least one dose. And the most recent ONS survey on hesitancy suggests positive vaccine sentiment among people in the UK surveyed had actually increased to % in the latest period .Thataposs up from % when the figures were first collected in December.Who is rejecting Covid vaccines Again, itaposs really too soon to know for sure as the rollout to younger adults gets underway. The Covid vaccine is incredibly unique in that it looks set to eventually be offered to entire populations, including young and healthy people- for a virus scientists know most severely affects older and vulnerable groups. Because so few young people have been vaccinated, the full scale of rejection is not known. The ONS vaccine surveys give some idea of which groups are most likely to decline the Covid shots on offer. The highest levels of Covid vaccine hesitancy are seen among younger adults, who the rollout is yet to extend to. Around one in sixof all adults aged  to  years reported being unsurethey would take a jab. Statisticians noted that one in eight adults in deprived areas report vaccine hesitancy, compared with % of adults in the least deprived areas of England. And one in  parents of young children were also unsure about the jab - but that had decreased from % earlier this year, the figures showed. Britainaposs black and Muslims communities have been found to be more likely to report wanting to decline the vaccine - but that is changing. Grassroots efforts to increase jab rates in the UKaposs minority communities have focused on dispelling distrust of authorities stemming from experiences of mistreatment. The efforts seem to be working, according to the ONS. Four in ten black adults were most likely to report vaccine hesitancy earlier this year, but the latest data showed that had shrunk to around  in  by March. In Bolton, an expert gave another explanation this week for why some people might not be taking up the jab in poorer areas - explaining itaposs not just about fear.Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the vaccination programme in Bolton, told the Manchester Evening News failure to get a jab could be down in part to deprivation.I donapost think thereaposs a hesitancy as such, I think itaposs more about the barriers to vaccination, she said. This is a really deprived area, people donapost all have cars generally, they might not have money for the bus, they might not want to get on the bus because they could catch Covid. Maybe theyaposve got several children or theyaposre looking after elderly relatives, thereaposs all sorts of reasons. She said experts had door-knocked in low uptake areas and initially thought the issue was hesitancy. But they now believe it is more likely to be related to social factors and the availability of appointments. To go to the main site youaposve got to ring your GP, get through to somebody, get an appointment booked and then plan that into your le, Dr Wall added.  If youaposre working shts,youaposre doing low-paid sht work you canapost just nip out for a vaccine because youaposve got an appointment, you canapost always know what your shts are going to be, you canapost plan that, so thereaposs so many barriers. In response to those concerns, Boltonaposs NHS launched a aposvaccine busapos for communities with the lowest uptake.Are anti-vaxxers affecting uptake rates  The UK is already facing anti-vaccine sentiment, and jab conspiracy theories have been pushed at anti-lockdown rallies throughout the past year. Some experts have blamed it the spread of vaccine denial myths on social media, which long predate the pandemic. In March , the NHS England chief executive of NHS England warned anti-vaxxers influencing people on social media may be contributing to the declining uptake of the childhood MMR measles jab. There are fears conspiracy theories fuelled by vaccine deniers will affect the Covid vaccine rollout too.  But some Brits are highlighting their own change of heart about conspiracy theories to encourage other people to trust scientists.Just this week, a Liverpool boxing coach told how he didnapost think Covid was dangerous until it nearly killed him. Michael Allen, , harboured doubts about the threat of the virus until he was rushed to hospital with dangerously low oxygen levels. He posted a video to social media thanking medics and highlighting his condition to warn others not to believe people downplaying the pandemic.Mr Allen said: I think a lot of people got the wrong end of the stick about coronavirus.The whole idea of the video, it was making a point to people around me that, basically, just because they could not see it doesnapost mean it isnapost there.People were sending me all sorts of messages because they could not believe what they were seeing.Dr Patricia Rossini, a Derby Fellow in the Department of Communication and Media at the University of Liverpool and an expert in disinformation and digital media is warning people misinformation can be spread unwittingly by family and friends. The real problem is that a lot of people will inadvertently engage with this and will spread it further, she told the Echo. That is part of the problem a lot of us are looking at news while weaposre using Facebook, sometimes on our phones, sometimes when weaposre on public transport so the attention youaposre paying there may not be very high.You may not always remember.... sometimesyouaposre looking at information and news on social media you donapost even remember where itaposs from. So I think that people sometimes lose the frame of reference of who to trust and where to look for information.What are the challenges The highest levels of Covid vaccine hesitancy are seen among young adults yet to be offered the jab. Experts will be watching closely to see whether they take up the vaccine as eagerly as older populations who have been at highest risk of dying from the virus.Public health campaigns are already working to dispel fertility myths circulating around vaccines. They will also be eying uptake rates among parents being offered jabs for their kids in future, mindful of recent yearsapos struggles to convince families to accept childhood vaccines like MMR.  Much like the influenza jab, keeping up annual rollouts could become a major concern for future public health campaigns, as experts warn the virus may be with us for years to come. Health authorities globally have so far heeded WHO warnings making vaccinations mandatory can end up only reducing trust in jabs. But critics are raising concerns about so-called vaccine apospassports.apos The UK government had repeatedly declined to call its jabs records vaccine passports as the travel ban lted on May , but its NHS app has recently updated to show jab status. This is being interpreted as an effort to help people prove their vaccination status as society works out to reopen safely for mass events and travel. Many countries are reopening borders to travellers who can show proof of a jab.And countries like Greece welcoming travellers without jabs are, for now, requiring steps such as proof of negative Covid tests. So experts will also be interested in what factors affect peopleaposs decisions to get a jab - as access to travel or big events like festivals could end up setting Covid jabs apart from other vaccines. How is the UKaposs vaccine rollout going  The government says the UK remains on track to give every adult a jab by the end of July. As of Wednesday, a total ,, nationwide had received at least one dose - thataposs more than % of all UK adults. Nearly million had received second doses. Younger adults are starting to receive jabs too - including Prince William, , who had his first shot on Tuesday after being struck by the virus last year. Now, people aged  and over expected to be invited this week to book their appointments.Thousands of volunteers will receive a boosterapos shot as part of a trial launching this week in a bid to beat a potential winter surge of the virus as lockdown lts, Mr Hancock announced this week.And soon, more potential new jabs could be on the way following Modernaaposs addition to the rollout, as UK volunteers get shots to help researchers trialling new shots. Next up, major vaccine drugmakers are trialling the currently available shots on children, who have always been expected to be last in the priority queue as healthy kidsapos risk of severe illness is lowest.  And a study has opened in the UK looking at safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pregnant women. Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said on Wednesday the success of the rollout was not be accident but down to careful planning and precision by NHS staff who have now delivered . million doses across England in less than six months. Mr Hancock said the UKaposs vaccination programme was the fastest and most successful in NHS history and welcomed the rolloutaposs extension to adults in their mid-s. This is incredible news and means we remain on track to hit our target of offering a vaccine to all adults by the end of July. The Mirror approached Department for Health and Social Carefor comment on the Health Secretaryaposs claims about Bolton vaccine hesitancy. The government has directed £ million in funding to  councils and voluntary groups to boost vaccine uptake. The government and NHS are holding regular meetings with local authorities, faith leaders and community organisations to work on improving uptake, and have translated vaccines information into multiple languages.

For those who were fortunate, painful commutes became a thing of the past, almost ­overnight. There was a flurry of activity in the ­property market as people, no longer bound to their workplace, moved to areas that were cheaper and nicer. But instead of having more free time on their hands, it’s led to a worrying trend of work hours increasing by up to %. The Office for National Statistics found that people working from home during lockdown were doing at least six extra hours of unpaid overtime a week.  So a new report from the World Health Organisation that reveals people who work  hours a week or more are at increased risk of stroke and heart disease is particularly worrying. The first worldwide study of its kind found that , people in  died due to diseases from working extra hours. These exhausting longer shts were responsible for about a third of all ­work-related illnesses. People in the UK were already putting in the longest working weeks in Europe, even before Covid. I’ve worked from home for several years. I felt like one of the lucky ones. Not having to commute or worrying about things like taking a one-hour lunch break meant I could pack much more work in. What I should have been doing is packing in more time away from my computer and phone. When it comes to how much extra work we do, we can point the finger of blame at technology. It’s never been easier for work to get hold of us and days are stacked with Zoom meetings that could have just been emails. Whatever happened to picking up the phone  If you’re like me, your phone doubles up as an alarm clock and so it becomes almost routine to check emails first thing in the morning as well as last thing at night. None of that is any good for our mental or physical well-being. As things start to open back up, I hope this worrying trend is reversed. If lockdown has taught us anything it’s the importance of taking our health ­seriously and spending time doing the things that really do matter. It shouldn’t be a lesson we quickly forget.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusStressHeart attackStrokeWork From Home"},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan markle hint they","story":"NewsHarry and Meghan Markle hint they have no plans toto UK in foreseeable futureThe couple have reportedly made a formal application to wind up their UK-based charity, in a hint their future plans do not involve coming back any time soonmirrorShareCommentsByMichael MoranLaurie Churchman:,  MAY NewsThe couple could be waving goodbye for good – after a formal application was made to wind up Harry and Meghans UK-based charity\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Aside from the fact the couple have a baby on the way, documents reportedly filed this month provide a further clue that the couple have no immediate plans toto the UK. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had set up a foundation – briefly and controversially known as Sussex Royal – in July  as an umbrella organisation for their charity work. But now the non-profit organisation, renamed in  as MWX Trading, is being closed down completely. Documents filed with Companies House show the couple made a formal request to shut down the charity on May , .They also appointed a liquidator to supervise the winding-down of the foundation, the Daily Star reports. The move is a strong hint that Meghan and Harry have no current plans for operations in the UK. Harry has already suggested that he hopes to make Calornia his permanent home, telling Oprah Winfrey in their March  interview that he loved living in LA because he likes to have outdoor space where I can go for walks with Archie …and we go for walks as a family and with the dogs. “You know, we go on hikes or go down to the beach, which is so close,” he added. The young Prince reveals in his upcoming mental health documentary series with Oprah Winfrey, The Me You Can’t See, that he still suffers from the trauma of his mother’ sudden death. He has said in the past that he didn’t allow himself to think about her death for many years, before eventually getting help after a period of “total chaos”.  But, he says in the new documentary, the best thing you can do in those situation is to ask for help: “To make that decision to receive help is not a sign of weakness,” he says. “In today’s world, more than ever, it is a sign of strength.” Meghan makes a brief appearance in the show’s trailer, smiling and wearing a T-shirt that says “Raising the Future” in a reference to the couple’s son and the daughter they will soon welcome. The couple told Oprah the baby is due in the “summertime.” Prince Harry recently explained his decision to leave the Royal Family for the US in an explosive podcast interview.He discussed his struggles growing up in the spotlight, saying it had felt like a mixture between The Truman Show and being in a zoo. He told the Armchair Expert Podcast he would think: I donapost want to be here, I donapost want to be doing this, look what it did to my mum. How am I ever going to settle down and have a we and family when I know itaposs going to happen again.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarklePrince HarryOprah WinfreyDocumentariesRoyal FamilyMental health"},{"url":null,"title":"psychotic life seaworld orca tilikum","story":"NewsPsychotic le of SeaWorld orca Tilikum - forced drugs, bullied and deadly gamesAs horric details emerge of the  death of Dawn Brancheau, the story of the killer whale that mauled her reveals decades of madness and captivitymirrorShareCommentsByAlex Bellotti:,  MAY NewsThe death of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in  at the hands of killer whale Tilikum shocked the world \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

When the -year-oldaposs leless body was finally released from the jaws of a psychotic orca weighing more than five tonnes, her head was found scalped - while part of her arm was missing. The experienced trainer is one of three people to have been killed by Tilikum, once the worldaposs largest killer whale in captivity, who continued to be housed at the park in Orlando until his death in .This week, sickening details of the incident have emerged from a police report which recounts how the beast performed a deep e during its deadly game.Dawnaposs horrendous death sparked widespread outrage, as former staff members and activists railed against SeaWorldaposs treatment of animals - allegedly driving them to the point of madness. Captured when he was just two years old and allegedly fed drugs to stave off grim injuries, here is the tragic story of Tilikumaposs victims and his own heartbreaking le. Student killed by aposexcitedapos orca trio Two decades before Dawnaposs death, a -year-old student was also killed by Tilikum and two other whales at Sealand of the Pacic in British Columbia, Canada. On February , , just as the final killer whale show finished for the day, Keltie Byrne - who worked part-time at the public aquarium - was tidying up when she slipped and fell into the pool.  Before she could haul herself back on to dry land, one of the whales had pulled her in. Steve Huxter, head of animal training at Sealand at the time, said: They never had a plaything in the pool that was so interactive. They just got incredibly excited and stimulated. As trainers desperately tried to help from the pool side, throwing a le ring into the water, they couldnapost determine which of the killer whales had hold of Keltie. She managed to reach the surface twice - her terried screams for help echoing around the pool. After  minutes of being thrown around by Tilikum and the two other whales - Haida II and Nookta IV - Keltie bobbed to the surface for a final time. This time, she was silent - the student had drowned. Eyewitness Nadine Kallen said at the time: She went up and down three times. [The trainers] almost got her once with the hook pole, but they couldn’t - the whales were moving so fast. An inquest found that the orcas had prevented Keltie from getting out of the pool and ruled her drowning death an accident. Little more than  months after Keltieaposs tragic death, Sealand closed its doors for good. SeaWorld bought all three of the orcas, with Tilikum and Nookta moving to Orlando, while Haida and her calf, Kyuquot, were shipped to San Antonio. Eight years later, Tilikum killed again. Daniel Dukes was found dead on the orcaaposs back while he was in his sleeping pool. The -year-old had visited SeaWorld earlier that day and managed to avoid security cameras to stay until after dark. He got into Tilikumaposs tank, naked, and when his body was found the following morning, he was covered in cuts and bruises. An inquest ruled he had drowned. SeaWorld aposposter girlapos scalped and mutilated Dawn Brancheau had worked at SeaWorld for  years - quite literally becoming the parkaposs poster girl as one of its star killer whale trainers. A dedicated professional, she worked hard on her health and fitness to cope with the rigours of swimming up and down with the beasts in her care.  In particular, she had a special relationship with Tilikum, also known as Blackfish, who had by now been in captivity for more than  years. Those who worked with her said their bond was strong and based on love and trust. John Hargrove, a senior trainer at SeaWorld at the time of Dawnaposs death, said: We’ll never know why Tilikum made that choice to grab Dawn and pull her into the pool. He had a great relationship with her, and she had a great relationship with him. I do believe that he loved her, and I know that she loved him. It was after one of the parkaposs Dine With Shamu shows on February , , that Tilikum carried out his brutal act. Tourists could watch the action from screens beneath the water as they ate and saw Dawn climb out of the pool. She was lying with her face next to Tilikumaposs - the orca she had spent countless hours with and who had always treated her as a trusted companion. Suddenly, Dawn was dragged into the water. Initially it was claimed she had been pulled into the pool by her ponytail, but there were later suggestions Tilikum had grabbed her by her shoulder.  What came next was truly gruesome. Tilikum didnapost just kill his trainer - the attack was prolonged and incredibly violent. As Dawn drowned, her left arm was torn from its socket, her head was scalped, and her hair and skin were found at the bottom of the pool. Horrically, her spinal cord was severed, while she also suffered from broken ribs and a broken jaw. A post-mortem revealed she died from both drowning and blunt force injury. Chillingly, the captive whale killed his trainer and then refused to release her body. For  minutes, he kept Dawnaposs broken body in the pool with him, despite attempts from the other trainers to distract him with nets and food. Eventually, they managed to get him into a smaller, medical pool, where he was easier to calm and he finally released the body of the trainer. Following Dawnaposs death, Tilikum was sent to spend most of his days in a pool rarely seen by the public. There are reports that he would spend hours on end just lying on the surface of the water. Tilikum died at the Florida attraction in January . Whales aposself-harmed and were given Valiumapos Six years after Dawnaposs death, SeaWorld announced it would end its programme of breeding the orcas in captivity. However, animal rights campaigners have long called for a ban on the animal shows altogether, with former staff members claiming the creatures have been starved, drugged and put under so much stress that they self-harm.Jeffrey Ventre, who joined SeaWorld as a trainer in , told The Sun that the killer whales were subject to intense psychological trauma and even given Valium. “There was a lot of self-mutilation. Jaw popping was regularly seen - itaposs a threat display between two orcas, he said. “The whales and dolphins were stressed and this caused stomach ulcers. They got meds for that. They also got chronic infections, so they got antibiotics. They were also sometimes aggressive or hard to control, so they could be given Valium to calm their aggression. “All whales were getting vitamins packed in their fish. Several got daily antibiotics, including Tilikum, for chronic teeth infections.” Since SeaWorld - which has four parks across San Diego, Orlando, San Antonio and Abu Dhabi - first opened in , at least  orcas have died at its US sites, according to the UK charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation. In the wild, the average le-span of a male orca is  years, while a female usually lives to at least . In theme parks, however, most of the whales die in their teens and twenties. Tilikumaposs decades of trauma Experts told the landmark  documentary Blackfish that they believed Tilikumaposs capture and captivity had rendered the intelligent, sensitive animal psychotic - claims SeaWorld has denied. He was just two years old when he was torn away from his family off the coast of Iceland and taken to a concrete holding tank at Hafnarfjördur Marine Zoo near Reykjavík. There, he reportedly spent close to a year either swimming in circles or floating still on the surface before being shipped to Sealand of the Pacic in . The documentary heard how he was housed with the two older female orcas, Haida II and Nootka IV, who sought dominance, with females being at the top of the social structure in the wild. For  hours a day, the incompatible trio were allegedly forced into a ft-wide enclosed metal-sided pool known as aposThe Moduleapos, where the females raked Tilikum with their teeth in the darkness. He is said to have started suffering from stomach ulcers and was eventually isolated in a medical pool to protect him from the bloody attacks. Former SeaWorld trainer Sam Berg told the documentary: “There has not been a single incident of killer whales harming humans in the wild. In captivity, it’s happened more than  times. “Someone saidyou put a human in a bathtub for  years they’d be psychotic too, and it began to fall into place.

Matt Heason, , already had all the equipment so thought he may as well put it to use while the family were stuck at home during lockdown. He strung up ropes, attached climbing holds to the walls, and installed all manner of grips, hanging bars, and straps so that his son, Dylan, could climb all over the house. Then he challenged his -year-old son to climb from the kitchen table to his bed in the attic without touching the floor in an epic aposfloor is lavaapos game.  Matt Heason, from Grindleford, Derbyshire, said: We most recently did it in February, weaposve done it three times. The first one was at my parentaposs house back in , then we decided to do it in our own home during the first lockdown. We didnapost have to do a lot, at my parentaposs house we had to screw holds into the ceiling and cut a hole in the roof to dangle a rope down, all so he could climb up. In our own home, we didnapost have to do as much. He sleeps in the attic, and the initial idea was to get from the bedroom into the garden for breakfast. He climbed out of the bed and out an escape ladder, which he climbed down, with a safety rope on, and then in through a window underneath and from there he was able to use furniture, bars, rails to get outside.  He went down two more flights of stairs like that, then when he was outside he was able to climb on the brickwork and onto a wall, then down the wall onto a climbing frame and onto the shed roof which was the finish point. Then we reversed it, for this one he had to get from the dining table to his bedroom. He climbed up the stairs by balancing on the bannister rails, then stopped to brush his teeth while dangling off a pull-up bar, then chimneyed it up the next stairway - thataposs a climbing technique with your hands are on one wall and the feet on the other.  Now weaposve made a climbing wall that leads into his bed, he has to climb in every time into the bed which is in the apex of the room. Matt said he installed the climbing equipment because Dylan and his big brother, -year-old Bryn, couldnapost get to their usual climbing wall - the Climbing Works in Sheffield, Yorkshire, to practice. He continued: Heaposs got an older brother as well and they both do a lot of training, so over lockdown, we set it up at home so they could practice - including ropes, bands, weights, and a rope hanging from the ceiling. Itaposs like our whole house is a climbing frame, my we despairs sometimes. Matt, who runs the Sheffield Adventure Film Festival, lives in the Peak District with his we, -year-old Sophie, and together they take their sons climbing at least twice a week. This weekend, they will be taking part in a youth climbing event in Loughborough, organised by outdoor equipment company Petzl.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Mia Flynn, , who had enjoyed multiple bottles of wine at her palaposs house, was left apospetriedapos after initially misidentying the Husky as a wolf. She admits her memory was hazy after drunkenly walking back to family home on May  after a boozy night out. So he was left terried to wake up to the dog aposstaringapos at her - leaving her fearing the aposwolfapos would attack her. In the video, Mia can be seen whispering to the camera aposIaposm too scared to move in my own bedapos as she pans over to reveal the hairy hound relaxing next to her, entirely unbothered.  The learning support worker pieced together her steps from the previous evening after finding footage on her phone. One clip shows the husky wandering around Miaaposs kitchen as she says bewilderedly: Of all the things Iaposve come home with on a night out. What the f**k is that  He followed me home.Mia, from Rhyl, Wales, said: I went to my friendaposs help to her do a bit of DIY and painting...then we decided that three bottles of wine were a good idea.I was a little shocked when I woke up hungover, to a dog staring at me.I was petried he was going to attack me - I find dogs cute but theyaposre also a bit scary. Especially a b***** big one like that.Despite being drunk, Mia had had the foresight to record her encounter with the dog, which she had named Toby, and how it had followed her home. However, she did not remember coming in at . am with the mutt and telling her fuming mum that she had aposgot a new mateapos.I documented the whole thing on my Snapchat, and thataposs how I pieced together the story the next morning, said Mia.So I was walking home from her house after midnight when the dog started following me. He was just wandering the street - [I later found out] it was the street he lived on, so I assume heaposd just gotten out.My mum was fuming. She was in bed when I apparently came in at : am and told her aposIaposve got a new mate.aposShe wasnapost pleased, even though she was fine the next morning.This definitely isnapost out of character for me - everyone knows I go a bit mad after a drink. But Iaposve never brought an animal home.One video shows the unwitting dog sitter walking home with the husky following along, as Mia says: Thereaposs a full-on f**king wolf following me. Itaposs too late for this, I feel like an Eskimo.Once Mia figured out what had happened by retracing her steps through her Snapchat story, she shared a snap of the dog on her Facebook.Mia said: I knew everyone would find it funny as I had so many messages on Snapchat when I woke up that morning.But I put it on Facebook to try and find the owner. The poor dog in a strangeraposs house probably just wanted to go home. A girl I have on Snapchat recognised the dog and got in touch with the owner for me.The owner said all the tears over losing him were worth it when she added me on Snapchat to see my story. She found it hilarious.She was grateful he had a sleepover at my house.Her one night of dog ownership has not done much to persuade her on getting a pet pooch in the future.Mia said: I still donapost want a dog. It was fun whilst it lasted, I guess. He b***** looks like a wolf, but he was a lovely dog to be fair.I called him Toby while I had him - it was the first name that came to my head while I was drunk.Iaposm glad heaposs home safe and sound.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Yazmina Jade Adler, from Australia, made headlines in  after claiming she relieved her severe period pain by rubbing menstrual blood on her face during a ritual meditation.Now, the Gold Coast business owner has attracted attention again after imposing a controversial policy banning coronavirus vaccine recipients from her Palm Beach salon.Immunology experts say it is scientically impossible for Covid- vaccines to cause illness in unjabbed people as they contain no live virus or any other infectious material that can pass from person to person.Ms Adler told News : It doesnapost really make sense, I guess a lot of people will question that, [but] it is like anything, like the disease or virus, it is spreading [jab particles] somehow and women are reporting side effects when they havenapost had the vaccine. She announced the new rule over Khemia HI vibe frequency salonaposs social media pages on Monday, stating: We are not your hairdresseryou have had the Covid vax.The unknown health effects of the mRNA vaccine are not covered by our public liability insurance, Ms Adler wrote on Facebook and Instagram. She apologised for any aposinconvenience to customers but said the safety of our staff and existing clients is our priority, adding the policy would be re-evaluated in  when clinical trials of the experimental injection are completed. But social media users hit back at her decision. One Facebook user said: I find your business decision ludicrous!! I’m a hairdresser andanything I’d rather my clients were vaccinated, but it’s a personal decision and I won’t discriminate! Another questioned: Itaposs curious to read that so many people who are so vehemently standing up for their right to privacy and standing against a vaccine passport are also asking people to disclose their vaccination history at a hair salon not run by medical experts  More challenged her decision: So just to confirm that the essential health workers, first responders and those working the frontline in health that have to get this vaccine are not welcome in your salon  The businessapos posts have since been flagged as missing context and defying scienceapos by independent fact checkers, the Australian Associated Press.  In a statement addressing the claims, AAP said a Facebook post circulating online claims that countless reports and anecdotes affirm people who are unvaccinated against Covid- are becoming ill just by being in the vicinity of those who have had the jab. The y post lists alleged examples of illnesses and injuries unvaccinated people have picked up from vaccinated people. These include irregular and heavy menstruation, bleeding while pregnant and miscarriages as well as supposed cases of pets dying when touched by someone who got the Covid jab. Associate professor Menno van Zelm from Monash Universityaposs Department of Immunology and Pathology agreed, saying that there are aposno credible reportsapos that vaccinated people can make other people ill. For one, Covid- vaccines do not contain the virus nor any other infectious agent that is contagious, Dr van Zelm said in an email. Yes, the vaccine activates the immune system and can make the recipient feel unwell for  hours, but this does not affect bystanders. Ms Adler, who also offers aposcrystal healingapos and aposfrequency technology and sound healing for your full mind body hair experienceapos in her salon, rose to fame two years ago after appearing on SBSaposs show Medicine or Myth.

Trained marksman Jurgen Conings, , fled his home near the Dutch border after taking weapons from his barracks. The soldier - dubbed aposthe Belgian Ramboapos - is said to have made threats towards Marc Van Ranst, . The virologist led the countryaposs public health response to the coronavirus pandemic and has advocated vaccination. Conings, who is said to have far-right tendencies, is thought to be hiding in the north-eastern part of Belgium. Hundreds of special forces soldiers have been deployed to try and find the wanted man, who is described as highly dangerous. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  His vehicle was found on Tuesday night containing four missile launchers. It has been reported that Conings also stole a pistol and an FN P - capable of firing rounds that can pierce bulletproof vests. There are indications that he is violent and, in the last  hours, evidence has emerged that the man poses an acute threat, Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne told VTM Nieuws.  Mosques, schools and roads were remain closed in Belgium on Thursday the search entered its third day. Armed soldiers are also on alert in the Netherlands and Germany in case Conings manages to cross the border. He is described as potentially lethal due to his experience during operations in extreme conditions including Afghanistan and Iraq.Coningsapos Twitter profile says he is a Belgian Air Force soldier who likes fitness, body building and boxing. A wanted appeal put out by the Belgian Federal Police describes Conings as having a muscular build, bald and possibly in possession of firearms. Anyone who spots the soldier is urged to contact the force without delay.Belgian newspaper Le Soir said residents reported hearing gunshots in Limbourg Nature Park on Thursday, where a search is being carried out.Hoge Kempen National Park has also been closed while authorities comb for clues.

Conings is said to have left letters indicating he is prepared for a deadly battle with police and could no longer live in a society where politicians and virologists have taken everything away from us. It has also been reported that he warned would join the resistance and would not surrender. Mr Van Rast and his family have been taken to a safe place while the situation unfolds.He wrote on Twitter: Being against health measures and vaccines and against the coronavirus too often coincides with a glorication of violence and brutal racism...Let one thing be clear: such threats do not impress me. Questions have also been raised after it was revealed that Conings was on a watch-list containing the names of potential far-right terrorists. His girlfriend told local press that he was always supportive to his family and friends and enjoyed cuddles. It is unclear what tipped him over the edge though he had been reprimanded by the army for “racist” comments in online chat groups and had been demoted to a training job that no longer involved missions abroad. In the note he sent to his girlfriend, sent by email, he said he could not stand the restrictions under which he had been placedFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGuns"},{"url":null,"title":"kim jong un orders ban","story":"NewsKim Jong-un orders ban on Chinese medicine after death of high-level officialThe North Korean leader is said to have taken action after learning of the jab and blocked all treatments from coming across the border and into Pyongyang - including Covid- vaccinesmirrorShareCommentsByJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsDictator Jong-un was said to have been left angry \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The injection he was given is usually used to treat fatigue but is sometimes used as a aposcure-allapos in North Korea, a source said. The country - which claims to have suffered no cases during the pandemic - is currently pushing medicines made domestically. Foreign treatments are widely unavailable at the moment due to sanctions on North Korea. But reports say many citizens still distrust medicines made in the country.

Vaccine samples under research have also been banned, it is said, with the focus switched to domestic jabs. North Korea sealed off its land borders with China and Russia last year to stop the spread of the pandemic. But, while this may have helped cases, it has meant the import-dependent economy has suffered. The news comes days after Jong-un reportedly outlawed skinny jeans and mullets - to keep young people under control. The despot is said to fear decadent Western influence on the countryaposs youth - amid fears it could cause his regime to crumble. Ripped and skinny jeans, and extravagant haircuts, are all viewed as signs of an invasion of capitalistic lestyle, it is claimed.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNorth Korea"},{"url":null,"title":"lived north koreas secretive world","story":"NewsI lived in North Korea’s secretive world - I was followed, filmed and banned from busesMonitored by creepy surveillance, drawn in by propaganda and blanked by locals, Brit Lindsey Miller lts the lid on le in the hermit state in a new bookmirrorShareCommentsByAlex Bellotti:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Running her hand underneath the flowers on the windowsill, she discovered a blue mobile phone - before an embarrassed waitress hurried over and picked it up. She went back to polishing glasses asnothing had happened, explains Lindsey. It didn’t mattersome measures to keep an eye on foreigners came across as hapless. What mattered was that we felt watched and under control. It was an unnerving reminder of the realities of le as a foreigner living in North Korea, famously the most secretive nation in the world under the rule of despotic dictator Kim Jong-un. Accompanying her husband on a diplomatic posting to the British Embassy in the capital Pyongyang, Lindsey is one of only a handful of Westerners to have experienced le first-hand in the shadowy hermit state.  In her new photo book, North Korea: Like Nowhere Else, she paints a vivid picture of communities kept under the close grip of police surveillance, while also unravelling some of the wider misconceptions about North Korean society. Lonely and kept at armsaposby locals fearful of foreigners, she found herself at the epicentre of a dangerous war of words between Kim and former US president Donald Trump - even becoming deceived by the warped propaganda that lined every street corner. Spied on by men in black suits A musical director and award-winning composer now living back in the UK, Lindsey and her husband were posted in North Korea in . Like any well-read visitor, she arrived in the midst of a hot, muggy summer with her own preconceptions. I knew that a pervasive cult of personality subsisted on air-lted lobster and caviar, while most of the population was condemned to beggary and misery, she writes. I’d seen the footage of goose-stepping soldiers, Cold War-style military parades, ballistic missile and nuclear tests, and the almost comedic, profound yet ultimately inconsequential, other-worldliness of the place. Settling down in the capitalaposs Munsu Dong district, where a tiny collection of foreigners reside, Lindsey was greeted by roadside outposts manned by armed guards and had a constant feeling of being watched. While free to walk and drive around the city, tight restrictions are put on Westerners - they have to be accompanied by authorised personnel on theand in taxis, while buses are off-limits.  Lindsey also struggled to find reliable internet connection and couldnapost call the outside world from her North Korean phone. More unsettling, however, was the constant attention from locals who would openly film her on their phones and take pictures. On one occasion, she describes being followed by two men in black suits at the height of the countryaposs famously harsh winter, watching in disbelief as they struggled for balance on the icy ground. I let it get to me too often, she says. But as suffocating as it sometimes felt, some instances were so ridiculous they simply made me laugh. Shunned by locals terried of guards The hardest part of everyday le for Lindsey, though, was struggling to make friends with North Korean residents. During her stay, she attended the famously dramatic military parades, joined running events and visited a plethora of restaurants and bars - many of which oddly double up as hairdressers, gyms and karaoke rooms. Talking to interpreters, drivers, waiters and cleaners who worked around the city, she found many were fearful of their conversations being misinterpreted by watching eyes - often ignoring or outright rejecting her. One of Lindseyaposs closest pals was a young girl called Min Jeong, an unusually outspoken worker at a local bar, the Myohyang Beer House. But even then, the limits of their relationship became clear over time.  Min Jeong was always unexpectedly candid about how bored or fed up she was,how tired she was of being set up on dates by her parents or being told by her friends that she had to lose weight, says Lindsey. She even went so far as to complain to me about some of the restrictions she endured. When I ran in the Pyongyang K she came to cheer me on, but at a distance from our mutual foreign friends. When I asked her why she didn’t let them know she was there, she just looked at me, widened her eyes and shook her head. ‘I couldn’t,’ she whispered. ‘Too much security. Didn’t you see all the security  Over time, the isolation began to overwhelm Lindsey. She became fearful that those who did try to befriend her had ulterior motives, such as three train conductors who shared noodles with her, only to smuggle packages in her bag to avoid customs. How much could I really trust these people  she says. This question would haunt me for the entire time I was there. I struggled to separate the human being in front of me from their environment. aposI was lured in by twisted propagandaapos As the months wore on, Lindsey also found herself subconsciously taken in by the red and yellow propaganda posters draped across buildings all over the city. Huge portraits of Kimaposs family, which alarmed her upon her arrival, faded into insignicance - but as they did so, it became easy to get swept up by government messages glorying Kimaposs achievements and railing against foreign superpowers. I would rationalise to myself the twisted behaviour of the system and somehow find myself buying into North Korea’s claims of victimisation by the West, Lindsey admits. I’d read translated statements by North Korean state media and think to myself that it was perfectly understandable that they wanted nuclear weapons. Why wouldn’t they when all they wanted to do was to protect themselves   While she soon separated herself from such thoughts, she also found her preconceptions about North Koreans were also wide of the mark.Fellow foreigners eager to tantalise locals with stories about Facebook, Amazon or other details of Western society quickly realised they not only knew about such things, but were far from in awe of them.Foreigners often failed to realise that the Koreans we were speaking to undoubtedly already knew the information we were so eager to impart and had probably been ideologically armoured against it, or at least were numb as to why they should care, she says. Min Jeong told me once that she was fed up with hearing about Facebook and told one man to shut up when he kept going on about the free internet. Terried of all-out war with West Tensions with the West nonetheless cast a dark shadow over Lindseyaposs stay. She recalls one day in September  being jolted awake by the sound of a ballistic missile being tested overheard, flying over , miles from a site near Pyongyang airport.As Donald Trump ramped up his war of words with Kim, the threat of conflict between the US and North Korea became an increasing concern for terried residents - who knew they would be unable to flee.A Korean friend told me they were worried about war breaking out, says Lindsey. They looked at me expectantly, willing me to say something in response. Ordinarily, I would have insisted that the US didn’t see North Korea as an enemy. I’d try and explain that it was their own propaganda exaggerating international responses to their own state’s reckless behaviour – but it was becoming increasingly dficult to do that, given what was coming out of the White House. However, against all odds, tensions began to cool. Trump and Kim adopted a more diplomatic approach, later culminating in the former presidentaposs landmark  visit to North Korea, which saw the two leaders even shake hands. As the hermit state was tentatively welcomed back into the international fold - even competing alongside its bitter southern enemy at the  Winter Olympics - the streets of Pyongyang underwent a face lt.  Propaganda slogans around the city, which had for decades encouraged the nation’s defiance against imperialist enemies, were replaced with more neutral expressions of ‘togetherness’ and musings on socialist construction, says Lindsey. Propaganda posters depicting American soldiers defeated by North Korean weapons and the US Capitol being destroyed by North Korea’s iron fist were gradually replaced with imagery of scientists, students and workers leading the country towards a better future. With the odd exception, state media dialled down its aggressive language. Shops stocking postcards and stamps for tourists suddenly ran out of the angry, anti-American designs, to be replaced by benign pictures of farms, fishing and factories. aposI knew Iaposd never see my friends againapos When it finally came time to leave in , Lindsey was overcome by a strange grief. Having failed to break down the walls of distrust with North Koreans, she nonetheless felt a sadness that the friends she had made would have to be cut out of her le completely. Here, there was no opportunity to stay in touch on Facebook, or invite them over to the UK for a holiday. Even after two years of friendship, I couldn’t break the wall, Lindsey says of those she met. They still couldn’t give the answers it felt like they wanted to give. I had tried to understand this country and desperately failed. But more than anything, the grief and definiteness of leaving behind the Koreans I cared about was the most painful part. I knew I would never see or hear from them again.North Korea: Like Nowhere Else by Lindsey Miller, published by September Publishing, is out now.

It is a fantastic gesture and one that is hugely appreciated by us.”Keiran’s Legacy has helped provide  automated external defibrillators, mostly in public places. The campaign also helps adults and children to improve their health and well-being.Mr Ross was elected to the Scottish Parliament on May  to represent the Highlands and Islands region, which covers Moray.#What his family have done in his name is truly inspirational.## Douglas RossHe already represents Moray as an MP at Westminster, so his pay at Holyrood is reduced from the ordinary £, to £,. The first pay cheque of the new job is lower than normal because of the timing of the election.Last month, Mr Ross said he would not take the cash from his second job at Holyrood and was exploring the idea of a charitable trust.Mr Ross said: “I am pleased to be donating the first month of my MSP’s salary to such a wonderful charity. Keiran’s death was an absolute tragedy but what his family have done in his name is truly inspirational and has helped to save lives.“Their tireless efforts are ensuring that people know what to do in le threatening situations and has placed vital defibrillators across our communities. That is a legacy to be very proud of and I know their excellent work will only continue to grow.“I know that this donation will be put to good use to educate more people in the use of CPR and enable more lives to be saved. I wholeheartedly congratulate everyone involved with Keiran’s Legacy and I am pleased to be able to be in this position to give a financial donation to support their work.“I saidelected as an MSP that I would donate my salary while I also continue as an MP and this is the first local charity that will benefit from the promise I made.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/Cerrys-and-Samantha-UO-558x372.jpg ","title":"dundee mum lands gig with fashion label whose clients include miley cyrus and paloma faith","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA young Dundee mum with aspirations to be a star of the fashion industry has received her first big break as she helps design clothes for one of the country#s biggest retailers.Cerrys Duke, , will be a member of a team producing garments for Urban Outfitters in Edinburgh, after taking part in the successful local project Kindred Clothing.The project, which is run by Dundee charity Front Lounge, aims to provide young mums with the skills and confidence to create clothes for themselves and their children using sewing courses online.Kindred Clothing is soon to receive official SQA accreditation, with Cerrys one of the first students to graduate.And she has since been offered a six-week placement working on the retail order for Urban Outfitters by Samantha Paton, who runs Dundee-based fashion label Isolated Heroes, whose key clients include celebrities Miley Cyrus, Paloma Faith and Kate Nash.Cerrys said: “I started Kindred Clothing to master a few basic sewing skills and to fix things, with Layla at my side, but I genuinely never thought I’d get an opportunity to work on a big design order for a major retailer.“I’ve loved soaking up the atmosphere of a real fashion business. The course and this placement have really boosted my confidence and shown I can do anything I set my mind to.“Kindred Clothing has also led to some lelong friendships – we’re like a family now and we’re all starting to see our potential and imagine what our futures could look like.”Garments created by Isolated Heroes which Cerrys has been working on, including embellished mot sweatshirts, will go on sale next Friday May  as part of a pop-up event within the Urban Outfitters store on Edinburgh#s Princes Street.Fashion label boss Samantha, who has been involved in the project from the outset, believes Kindred Clothing can fill a gap within the fashion industry.“For us, Kindred Clothing ticks a number of boxes,# she said.“We have the privilege of complimenting their skills and experience and, in , we can tap into their talent pool – these are women who are ready to learn, to improve and to listen.“Cerrys is extremely able but also possesses that rare skill of listening to feedback and acting on it. We’ve loved having her in the studio and she should be exceptionally proud of herself.”Cerrys has also been involved in the creation of garments that are on sale within the VA shop, where Isolated Heroes are the exclusive fashion collaborator for the Night Fever: Designing Club Culture exhibition.“Selling our creations within Urban Outfitters and VA Dundee simultaneously is just amazing and for Cerrys to be involved in that is wonderful – she could have a really bright future ahead of her,# Samantha added.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

Dens Park fighting it out in the Championship bearpit.Every single season in Scotland’s second tier is an all-out slog for almost every team involved.Even Hearts this year, despite being so far in front, still had to grind things out at times.Tomorrow and Monday, though, are Dundee’s chance to escape the Championship churn.And throw Kilmarnock right into the middle of it.Of the three potential challengers I would probably have had Killie as the least favourable for the Dark Blues.With Tommy Wright in charge and guys like Kyle Lafferty, Greg Kiltie and Chris Burke in attack there is real danger there.Killie, though, are a club who finished third just a couple of years ago and will feel they shouldn’t be in this position.Dundee can take advantage of that.All the pressure was on the Dark Blues to beat Raith in the semi-final – now that’s flipped to the Premiership side.Charlie Adam said the other day that there’s plenty of pressure at Dens Park to get back to the top flight.I understand that but Dundee are absolutely the underdogs in this tie.That’ll be a new experience for them after two years in the second tier.Aside from the odd cup match, the Dark Blues have been expected to win almost every match since they were relegated.It might just be a nice wee change of pace for the Dens men, being the side out to cause an upset.And they absolutely can do just that.Kilmarnock have their threats but so do Dundee.Adam, Jason Cummings, Paul McMullan, Osman Sow on his day, Jordan McGhee, Shaun Byrne, Jordan Marshallfit and Lee Ashcroft are all capable of doing damage at Premiership level.And there’s more on the way there, too.The advantage Killie have is their overall level of player, thoughout their starting XI, is higher.That’s the dference going up a level.It’s not about whether your best player is better than theirs.It’s about the guys at the other end of the spectrum and the team as a whole.Dundee will need every man on the pitch – the starting XI and every single sub – performing to their absolute maximum in both legs.I believe they can do it.I’ve said all season – and at times I did wonderI was talking rubbish – that the quality was there at Dens Park.In the last couple of months, they’ve shown that.➡️ https:t.co tkIwnm pic oyXczNdhmdash Dundee Football ClubMay , Defensively they look a lot more sound – losing the goal early against Raith could have spooked them but they saw the game out pretty well.Their away form is also very good with only one goal conceded in their last six on the road.So they won’t worrythey don’t get a great result at home.The Dundee players, though, have to believe absolutely it is their time.This is the opportunity they have worked so hard for over two years – go grab it and get out of the bearpit.The end of a season is always a time for reflection for football clubs.Dundee United will be no dferent this week as they look back on the past campaign.And they should be looking ahead with confidence, too.Their first term back in the Premiership was solidunspectacular.The job was to stay out of trouble – they did so and had a decent cup run.Manager Micky Mellon managed that without the ability to bring in more than a couple of players.That should be appreciated and recognised, evensome of the football was pretty dull.Fans will be demanding more next season, though, and rightly so.They’llbe back in the stands at Tannadice by the next time United kick a ball and they’ll let their feelings known pretty quicklythey aren’t enjoying themselves.Who the manager will be next term, though, is something that needs addressing.Rumours keep popping up about interest in Mellon from down south.Often there is no smoke without fire with these things.But, eventhere isn’t, any uncertainty over the manager isn’t a good thing for the club, players or anybody.Changing boss every year isn’t good in the long run either for a club.Stay or go – it would be good for everybody involved to get it sorted ASAP.To have the possibility of supporters attending the Scottish Cup Final this weekend dangled in front of people and then dragged away was pretty cruel.The timing of everything was all a bit unfortunate, to be honest. I think it was only about a day the prospect of punters being there lasted.But when there is a resurgence of the virus in a certain area, it’s only right to do everything to contain it.I’m proud to live in a country that has taken a cautious approach to everything Covid-wise, evenit upsets a few people.We’re getting closer to normality, just a little more patience is needed.LEE WILKIE: Why a draw could be the perfect result for Dundee in their play-off final first leg and good to see young players shine for United\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Why a draw could be the perfect result for Dundee in their play-off final first leg and good to see young players shine for United# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-draw-perfect-dundee-good-young-shine-united embed # secretawESblItm\" data-secret\"awESblItm\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

the cultural sector, Aberdeen Arts Centre has announced the venue will stage its first in-house professional theatre production since  this summer.#The last in-house production that we did was actually our panto Aladdin which was back in ,# said the Arts Centre manager Stephanie Walls.#Obviously, everything kept ticking for a few months in , but we personally didn#t do any in-house productions.#Stephanie is looking forward to staging Easy Money this summer, with tickets already on sale for the show taking place on July  and .Stephanie says that Aberdeen Arts Centre will be one of the first indoor cultural centres to reopen in Granite City.She said: #It#s nice to be able to get ahead of the game.#The show is planned for July, so we don#t know what social distancing will look like then, but we decided to get the ball rolling anyway and we are assuming it#ll still be the case in terms of people needing to distance.#We just wanted to start working towards something.#Stephanie, who will direct the in-house professional production, said she wanted to #get together a gang of local actors#.#There are seven actors in the piece, # said the Arts Centre manager.#Easy Money is a play that I have been very food of for a long time.#The show tells the story of a cash-strapped family who have been playing the football pools # secretly because their grandma who lives with them disapproves.Stephanie said: #The play is written by Arnold Ridley, who is most famous for playing Private Godfrey in sitcom Dad#s Army.#Not a lot of people know that he was a playwright before he was an actor.#Stephanie described the play as #gentle and funny# and is certain the Castlegate Arts production will make for a #lovely nostalgic night out# for local theatre-lovers.She added: #Since we#ve had such a dficult year, I wanted to put something on that was a lovely piece of fluffy light entertainment.#The actors will be in full costume and there will be a lot of humour # we will also be doing sound effects live on stage.#The show will be performed in a vintage radio studio style.#Some actors will also be swapping hats and doing dferent voices as they#ll be playing more characters.#You#d be hard-pressed to come out and have a bad time # let#s put it that way.#While the actors read through the play over Zoom to get into character, Stephanie said they#d start rehearsing in person just a week before the show.She added: #We#re planning to keep the staging socially distanced.#We#re a professional company so we could work within close range to each other because we would be in a bubble, but we just want to be on the safe side.#With drastically reduced capacity, families and friend groups will be seated in separate pods two meters from other attendees.Stephanie said: #We#ve been very lucky to be in a position to be able to adapt our auditorium into  pods so every household can be be two metres away from any other party.#I hope this immediate distance is going to give people a lot of reassurance.#We are constantly cleaning, we have a fogging machine # we fog between all performances # and we are also wiping down any touchable surfaces, and we have hand sanitiser everywhere too.#We also have a one-way system in place.#People can really book a ticket and feel safe and secure that they are not going to be in a crowded space # they can just get back to enjoying live entertainment and feel quite confident.#While Easy Money will be the King Street venue#s first in-house production, the family show Artie’s Singing Kettle will be the first show performed in front of a socially distanced audience at Aberdeen Arts Centre on May .Granite City#s first live theatre show since lockdown set for Aberdeen Arts Centre\"

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"new crop of msps welcomed","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May .

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

That was the simple point.Mr Bowsher later stressed the urgency of the situation early in the pandemic, with deals able to fold within ldquominutes.Emily Lawson, chief commercial officer of NHS England and NHS Improvement, said there were concerns from NHS trusts about the supply of PPE from early March .ldquoThe market was extremely lsquohotrsquo, with deals often failing within minutes of being confirmed, due to competitive bidding by other entities, she said in written evidence.Mr Bowsher argued the environment for buying PPE was a ldquosellersrsquo market, adding: ldquoSellers were able to watch buyers compete for the goods they had available, and compete they did ndash often in unscrupulous ways.The barrister said the DHSC recognised there were ldquoflaws in the process but they required context.Jason Coppel QC, for the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor, previously described the purchase of unusable PPE from PestFix and Ayanda Capital as a ldquocatastrophic waste of public funds.Mr Bowsher said the circumstances of procurement in the pandemic were dferent from typical arrangements.He told the court: ldquoWhile the claimants refer to the purchase of large amounts of PPE and appear to be complaining about that, they have not said the purchasing was unnecessary.ldquoOne has to accept that not everything that was delivered would meet the performance and other standards that one would expect in more placid times.ldquoYou cannot use waste as a concept in this case by looking at one contract or another, you have to look at the whole programme where the endeavour was to obtain as much of the necessary material as possible.The case, being heard remotely by Mrs Justice OrsquoFarrell, will resume on Monday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government defends use of  uVIP lane u for PPE supply in first wave of Covid"},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 23 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That much is obvious from her work at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, as well as performances in bands including Rhuvaal, one of Scotland#s fastest rising young traditional groups.It is moving that Alex chose to use that talent not only to pay tribute to Robert Black, someone who inspired her passion, but to raise money to help with the costs of operating the helipad named in his memory.We#re sure it#s not the last we#ll hear about Alex#s career in music.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May .

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh: Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors: in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint: With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade. Bold colours never go out of style.www.katelavie"},{"url":null,"title":"10-best-museums-galleries-edinburgh-glasgow","story":"One of the gems in Glasgowrsquos art crown, Kelvingrove re-opens on Monday giving punters the chance to enjoy its world-beating collection.

Then, something caught his eye.He ran to Izzy: ldquoAunty, aunty, look what I found!He was holding a scarf.ldquoIt was hanging on a tree over there, he said.It was a short neck scarf, with Celtic interlacing design it looked new and unworn, possibly even handmade.ldquoI really love it aunty, can I keep it Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoI dunno, Finn, someone may have dropped it and another person found it and placed it on the tree to keep it safe. Perhaps one of those walkers earlier. Maybe they will come back and look for it Finn wasnrsquot even half listening. He put the scarf on and rushed to the loch side to look at his reflection.ldquoIt would be safer round my neck surely  he called out.As he arranged the scarf, a folded piece of paper fell to the ground and landed by Finnrsquos feet. He picked it up, unfolded it and ran to Izzy, very excited.ldquoLook, the scarf is for me! he exclaimed.A worried look came over Izzyrsquos face as Finn handed her the piece of paper. There were beautully drawn Celtic designs, with images of what looked like faeries hiding in a wood.There was also a sleeping dragon curled round a heart shape in which there was handwriting: ldquoIf you have found me, and you like me, then Irsquom yours. Keep me safe, until itrsquos time to give me away.Izzy looked at Finn, nodded and smiled. ldquoSo it seems.ldquoI will never give this away! he insisted. He looked around at the trees and ed the gaze to his aunt.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, aunty, maybe fairies do exist after all, at least here we are in the Highlands after all.He thought for a moment. ldquoOr maybe itrsquos just someone kind who likes to give presents.Finn headed back to the tree where hersquod found the scarf. He arranged twigs and broken bits of heather on the ground next to the tree and beckoned his aunt to come see.She looked down at what hersquod done. She didnrsquot immediately see it, but then realised that the twigs and heather formed letters.He carefully read it: ldquoThank you.ldquoThatrsquos lovely Finn, whoever left the scarf will see this and be very happy, Irsquom sure of it.Izzy looked up to the sky. The predicted rain was going to hold off.ldquoFinn, she said hesitantly, ldquowould you be up for a bit of an adventure ldquoYou mean a walk, donrsquot you ldquoKind of, aye, but this is to a place I have never been before, although Irsquove often seen it from a distance.ldquoHow far  asked Finn.Izzy pointed: ldquoJust there, where those old trees are. Itrsquos a small remnant of the old Caledonian forest, Irsquove often wanted to visit it but have never had the opportunity. Itrsquos not so far, but it might be a bit dficult to reach, Irsquove never explored it before.Finn wasnrsquot sure.Izzy helped him decide: ldquoIt might have a connection to the original Merlin.That sold it to him.ldquoWell, I have my boots, he smiled, ldquocan I lead the way So they set off in the direction of Coille Coire Chuic, a small remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Izzy let Finn decide on the route and as they neared the wood they arrived at the River Cononish. There was no obvious and safe way to cross, but Izzy was sure there was a small bridge downriver.The route got increasingly boggy and Izzy suspected Finn may want to give up, but instead he took the role of leader seriously and carefully planned each step, identying dryer patches and helping his aunt. They made slow progress, but with much hilarity as they balanced on small tufts of dry land surrounded by bog myrtle.Finn paused and listened. The noise of a waterfall could be heard ahead and he aimed for it. Izzy lagged behind to take in the beauty of the heather, which carpeted the ground with a blaze of purple and pink. The old Scots pines on the other side of the river looked magnicent, framed by the mountains beyond.She caught up with Finn, who was sitting on a rock watching the waterfall. It cascaded into a hidden pool, where the water twirled and bubbled asin a giant cauldron. Scots pine trees stood guard on the edge of it, one growing precariously from the overhanging rocks, its trunk curving upwards so its higher branches reached the sunlight. A gnarled rowan with vivid berries grew from the rocks on the other side, while on the opposite bank birch trees clung onto the steep side of the river, bent over like weeping willows.Finn wanted to sit awhile and so Izzy took it as an opportunity to make a brew for them both. He was beginning to understand that using her small camping stove was an important ritual for his aunt: the hissing sound, the waiting, the trail of steam, the anticipation it made a warm feeling, turned a wild place into home.They sipped tea together and shared well-earned snacks. Finn waited, expecting his aunt to tell a story. Finally, she did.ldquoSee that giant boulder over there, Finn, it was dropped by the giants who sculpted this land many years ago.ldquoLike with Samsonrsquos stone we saw Izzy nodded.Finn raised a cynical eyebrow and half a smile.ldquoHuge giants, Finn, a race called the Fomorians. The legend says they emerged from the sea long ago ndash grotesque troll-like creatures, incredibly powerful and cruel. Two of them made Rannoch Moor their home and they terrorised the people for miles around, destroying homes and taking livestock.ldquoNobody knew what to do, even the bravest and best warriors were defeated by them, ripped apart without mercy. Then a young lad about your age had his home destroyed by one of the giants, and in his grief he decided to rid the land of them.ldquoBut how could he do thateven the best warriors couldnrsquot Izzy gave him a wry smile, which he knew meant that was a good question and that she was just about to answer it.ldquoThe lad was wise. He had noticed how the two giants argued with each other about who was the stronger.ldquoSo he got them to fight each other ldquoKind of, he persuaded them to have a competition to see who could throw a stone furthest. They began hurling bigger and bigger stones, then they tore chunks of rock off the mountain sides. Soon the land was littered with boulders, and after three days the two giants were utterly exhausted.ldquoThen the young lad told one of the giants he had won, for he knew this would cause a fight. And so it did.ldquoThe giants fought each other with fury, using up what energy they had left. Finally, one gave the other a fatal blow, but it was the last thing he did, as he collapsed with total exhaustion.ldquoThey had killed each other ldquoYes, smiled Izzy, filling her cup with more tea and raising it. ldquoThatrsquos why the land around here is littered with all these huge stones.ldquoI know giants are mythological, aunty.Izzy sipped some tea.ldquoDepends what kind of giants you mean.Finn looked at the boulder.ldquoThe next tale is the gt of the sun, continued Izzy.ldquoAfter the death of the giants the land was bathed in sunshine, bringing new le.It became a green world, grass and plants grew, then trees arrived. The ancestors of this tree were first to arrive, she pointed to the nearby silver birch.ldquoOthers followed: the rowan, the aspen, alder and even oak. But it was these trees which made the forest canopy: Scots pines, also called Caledonian pines, an old name given to them by the Romans. Arenrsquot they a beautul tree Finn peered at the Scots pines around them.ldquoCreatures filled the forest with their songs, their roars, their grunting and howling the birds, bears, wolves, elk, deer and boar. Seven thousand years ago, where we sit we would have been amidst the Caledonian forest in its prime. Those trees over there are the descendants of that forest. If you sit with them and feel their presence, they will tell you their stories.Finn chuckled at his aunt, then explained why. ldquoYou are like Yoda! He defensively held up his hands to explain: ldquoNot the way you look, I mean the way you speak about things.Finn was a Star Wars fan. He had all three films on video at home and knew much of the dialogue by heart. He spoke to Izzy, mimicking Yodarsquos voice: ldquoSearch the force, le creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. Finn gently pinched Izzy on the shoulder, saying: ldquoNot this crude matter. You must feel the force around you, the tree, the rock, everywhere.Izzy laughed out loud, feeling rather flattered to be compared to one of Finnrsquos screen heroes. She thanked him for the compliment.Finn looked over at the old Scots pines on the other side of the river. He knew his aunt wanted to reach them and they were tantalisingly close, yet the river was too dangerous to cross.ldquoLetrsquos find a way to get there, he ventured.They packed up and followed the river, eventually finding a place to cross. They sat amidst the flowering heather under the canopy of old trees, near a clearing so a light breeze kept the midges at bay. As promised, Izzy spun legends of Merlin, but also other tales connected to the ancient forest: of Lailoken, the Picts and St Columba, and the sad tale of the last wolf. Finn added tales of his own, about Jedi Knights and what he could remember of the story of Tam Linn. The forest was both their theatre and audience. But there was a sense of melancholy in this wood, for something was missing: it was bereft of young trees. The old pines were missing their children.The walk back was much quicker and they arrived back at the car tired, but with a sense of achievement. It felt asthey had been in a dferent world.ldquoCan we camp tonight aunty  asked Finn. ldquoAnd have a campfire like the first night ldquoLetrsquos see how the weather holds and how we feel later, she replied, keeping options open.Food was now a priority and Izzy was keen to get away from the busyness of Tyndrum.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

Perhaps you could go for a handwoven basket that matches the colour palette and style of your interior. This may be custom-designed, a classic terracotta pot, a vintage planter, or you can even make your own ceramic pots at a workshop.Which houseplants are trickier to grow Usually, plants that grow in very dferent native conditions such as high humidity can pose some challenges when growing them indoors. This includes alocasia, the banana palm and some philodendrons. Others such as the date palm require specic temperatures and lots of space to grow, which can also present challenges indoors.Which houseplants prefer shadier conditions For shadier conditions we recommend the ZZ plant , epipremnum, the Philodendron Brasil, as well as colocasia and azalea.Which houseplants can be moved to a sunny patio or balcony and can be left out in summer As long as temperatures dont drop too muchduring the warmer months, plants like the banana palm, kentia palm, agaves, opuntia, kalanchoe, crassula, haworthia and chamaerops palm can be kept outside at night.Some, like the palms and certain succulents, can even be kept outdoors all year long, but need to be protected from frost. Also ensure the soil and pot are well drained to prevent root rot due to heavy rainfall.How can the plants be cared for when the weather cools Before bringing your plants inside, check them for pests that they picked up outside. Make sure you find them a spot in your home where they get a similar amount of daylight as on your balcony or patio.Expect some leaf drop from the adjustment to new light conditions, which is normal, and help your plant by removing the dead leaves.Avoid any extreme changes in temperature and dont put your plants near or on top of the radiator, or next to a front door that opens frequently, as sudden hot and cold draughts can cause the plants stress.When you bring your plants inside, or when you start heating your home again during the colder months, adjust your watering schedule. Most plants require less water during hibernation, butyour apartment is very dry, use a humidier to keep your plants happy.Also, foliage growth slows down considerably during autumn and winter so you can stop fertilising until spring.Which houseplants will match your chosen destination Moroccan riad: Banana palm, papyrus plant, colocasia, Phoenix canariensis , bougainvillea, oleander, agave.Mediterranean haven: Lavender, Opuntia cacti, eucalyptus, olive tree, any kind of citrus tree, Chamaerops palm.Australian rainforest: Kentia palm, Schefflera actinophyla, umbrella tree, Epipremnum pinnatum, Alocasia brisbanensis, Hoya australis, Staghorn fern.South African safari: Strelitzia nicolai, kalanchoe, Zamioculcas zamiolia, string of pearls, crassula, Euphorbia ingens, haworthia, protea.Japanese garden: Azalea, Japanese spindle, moss balls , bonsai trees, a mini zen garden, Japanese painted fern.Amazonian jungle: Philodendrons of all sorts including monsteras, Thaumatophyllum xanadu, Calathea Burle Marxii, Calathea ornata, Begonia maculata, orchids, airplants, heliconia, dieffenbachia."},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-french-bean-toasted-hazelnut-salad","story":"Ingredientsg French or runner beans- tablespoons extra virginolive oil cloves garlic, peeled and sliced dried chilli crushed tablespoon red wine vinegarBlack pepperHandful finely chopped flat leaf parsley handfuls hazelnuts or pine nuts, roasted for - minutes in a medium oven.MethodTop and tail the beans.

A couple of hours later Irsquod be woken by a sozzled opera singer, wending his way home along Ingram Street and treating us to arias from Verdi and Puccini.Irsquod never lived anywhere like it, and even though I am now happily ensconced in the country, I miss the buzz and beauty of Glasgowrsquos majestic city centre. Yet there are some things I donrsquot pine for. Not long after I arrived, an independent grocer set up business, offering all the fruit, veg and granary loaves yoursquod ever need. Sadly, he didnrsquot last long, driven out by the proleration of micro-supermarkets. Soon it became harder to find a bag of red lentils than a magnum of champagne or a state of the art sound system.Children were as rare as ospreys. Yoursquod hear the purring of a Lexus as it idled at the lights, and at weekends the squealing of revellers tottering from club to club. But hardly ever did I see, let alone hear, a youngster. On our floor there were more French pugs than prams.The centre of Glasgow, with its high-end shops, restaurants, bars, and penthouse flats, prided itself on its glamour. Yet by the time we left, swathes of it had been turned into soulless student-land. This ever-shting community mirrored the wider picture: people living in self-contained pods, barely connecting with anyone .I never knew the names of our next door neighbours I couldnrsquot even have picked them out in an identity parade. As became increasingly apparent, you might have every extravagance money can buy within a five-minute walk, but painfully absent was a sense of community.The pandemic has highlighted a long-brewing problem. When shop and cafeacute shutters come down, students flee and the elderly retreat indoors, the centre becomes ghostly: a neighbourhood without a pulse.This unhealthy trend has not gone unnoticed. In recognition of the people-shaped hole at its heart, Glasgow City Council has devised a long-term plan to revivy the centre. Its Strategic Development Frameworksets out enlightened proposals aimed at regenerating six areas of the city, including what you might call the dead centre.For this zone, as with others, the aim is to transform it into a pedestrian-friendly and family oriented destination for day trips. At the same time the council wants to repopulate it, thereby making the area more appealing to residents who want to live there fully, rather than treat their flat as a bunkhouse. Along with initiatives to promote walking and cycling, and to reconnect the centre with surrounding districts, the hope is that by  its population will have doubled.No-one will miss the irony of trying to attract families back to an area that was once renowned for some of the highest-density housing in Europe. The demolition of overcrowded slums in the post-war era was seen as tackling disease and deprivation. Instead, the solution ndash tower blocks and housing schemes pushed to the outskirts ndash created arguably even worse problems. Meanwhile, the centre languished.It was this sort of short-sighted urban planning, which messed with peoplersquos lives, that the writer Jane Jacobs tore into. Her classic book, The Death and Le of Great American Cities ndash published in  but as fresh as todayrsquos newspaper ndash was a salvo against dehumanising architecture and development. When it came out, it was immediately understood, she said, by what she calls ldquofoot people: residents who either prefer to get around on foot, or wish they could ditch the car.Jacobs started out as a newspaper reporter, although she married an architect who, she wrote, taught her what she needed to become an architectural writer. That her views became so influential, despite her having no authority other than a clear mind and good taste, points to the obvious truth. Ordinary people instinctively know what makes a city tick: what works and what is doomed from the start.You donrsquot need a degree in urban planning to see that concrete wastelands, featureless parks or pigeon-hole flats in the sky are a recipe for misery. Or that well-designed green spaces allowing people to breathe completely change the mood and potential of a district. What Scotland needs right now is our own Jane Jacobs, to articulate the city dwellerrsquos view.The novelist John Cheever understood how hard it could be to pinpoint the problem. In The Wapshot Chronicle he describes a fictional scene: ldquoNorth of the park you come into a neighbourhood that seems blighted ndash not persecuted but only unpopular, asit suffered acne or bad breath, and it has a bad complexion ndash colorless and seamed and missing a feature here and there.Most of us who know Glasgow ndash indeed almost any city in the world ndash could point to places this perfectly fits. Now, it seems Glasgowrsquos leaders are intent on fixing the problems previous generations of developers helped create. I wish them well. But, unfortunately, there are factors to be considered which are beyond the control of any planner.Quite how to address this is for others to consider, butGlasgow city centrersquos transformation is to succeed then solutions to such wildcat problems must be factored into its vision. It sounds daunting, but it is not necessarily an impossible task.Jane Jacobs believed that, ldquoLively, erse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.Irsquom no expert, but that sounds like Glasgow to me.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It is noticeable that the carnage has not been condemned by Tory politicians or by Scotland in Union officials.Mr Wilson also ignores the clear scientic advice that shows poor ventilation in crowded indoor situations combined with the effects of alcohol makes the spreading of Covid much more likely.There is no reason for Scotland to follow Boris Johnsonrsquos disastrous handling of Covid as illustrated by his failure to put India on the red list which allowed thousands to travel to the UK and bring the more virulent Indian iant to Glasgow, thus making it much more dficult to reopen hospitality venues and football stadiums.If Glasgow has to suffer further or extended restrictions thanks to the selfish actions of those Rangers supporters in George Square, then itrsquos guaranteed Mr Wilson will blame the SNP.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.CELEBRATIONS WITHOUT THE BILETHE headline over Brian Wilsons article states that the \"SNP ... guaranteed George Square chaos\". Younger readers may not be aware of Mr Wilsons long history of visceral opposition to Scottish independence. Does he believe that the poisonous tribalism which afflicts our society in the West of Scotland and beyond and which sustains the dominance of the \"Old Firm\" over Scottish football is attributable in whole or in part to the SNP It may have escaped the notice of Mr Wilson and many others that the championships of SPFL League  and League  in  were also won by Glasgow teams. The smaller and more local tribes which support Partick Thistle and Queens Park were equally joyful and held celebrations which attracted little or no media attention.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WAS THERE UNITY IN A COMMON CAUSE NEIL Mackay claims that \"sectarianism shows a Scottish face to the world\" .As is understood, the tribal Rangers Celtic Protestant Catholic ide arose from immigration in previous centuries.It is to be hoped that sectarianism in the west of Scotland gathers less publicity when the world looks at Pollokshields and the strong public intervention to stop brutal dawn raids on two immigrants who were from a country far away.It would be interesting to knowthat gathering included many Rangers and Celtic supporters united in that effort to prevent the immigrantsrsquo deportation. Or in the same George Square on Sunday after the Rangers mayhem in the previous hours, who knowsthose united at the peaceful rally for Palestinians from another country far away from Scotland included Rangers and Celtic supporters protesting in that common cause Maybe any future humanitarian-type protestations could show a representation of peaceful Rangers and Celtic supporters in their colours to show the world that the destructive face of sectarianism is promoted only by a flawed section of small-minded people who are outnumbered by the big-hearted people of Scotland.

Yes, concern in our minds because we live in a country where such awful behaviour can still arise.

It transpired that they were not of the Islamic faith, rather Sikhism.

At least half of the heat demandcould be met by sourcing heat from the River Clyde and its tributaries.A report by greenspace Scotland suggests thehigh density of public owned buildings across the city makes it feasible for public assets to act as the first nodes that, over time, become linked together to create a heat network covering much of the city.Water is said to be a more efficient heat source than the air or ground.: Scotlands green future at risk from discriminatory grid charges to power firmsScotland remains bottom of the European league for renewable heat with just % of demand being met from low carbon sources.The cheap price of gas and the fact policy is entirely reserved to Westminster is said to be one of the biggest barriers to an expansion of renewables.As the host city for the  UN Climate Conference, COP, experts say Glasgow has the ldquoambition, political drive, economic strength and cohensive communityto lead the way.River catchments act as giant solar heat collectors. As these lsquoheat highwaysrsquo pass through urban areas, some of the heat can be extracted by submerged pipes and boosted in temperature by large scale heat pumps. The heat can then be distributed to surrounding buildings through sub-surface pipes known as district heat networks.Many European countries including Austria use the technology, while in Copenhagen  % of all existing buildings are connected to district heating networks.A poundm water-sourced system is now operational at the former John Brown shipyard in Clydebank, which is being cleared for thousands of homes.The system will cut West Dunbartonshirersquos CO emissions by more than , tonnes each year for the next  years, making Clydebank one of the greenest towns in Scotland and could eventually be used to power the Golden Jubilee hospital.: Shetland Islands: A driving force in renewable energyldquoItrsquos not a new idea,\" said Dave Pearson, a director of Star Refrigeration Ltd, which was recently involved in a project in Norway.\"Itrsquos just a lot more convenient to burn oil, gas, coal and trees.\"There is about two and half times as much heat in the River Clyde as the entire city centre area need, maybe a bit more.ldquoWersquove got an air quality crisis and gas is the biggest culprit.

However, it is also important that I exercise that mandate with responsibility and humility, and only when the crisis of Covid has passed. I give that commitment today.Whether that load of self-confessed humility emerges remains to be seen.However the pace of exercising her mandate is not, for now, in doubt.With the pandemic still proving immune to wishful thinking by politicians, the economy stumbling, and the polls showing it would be a terric gamble right now, the First Minister is not about to ramp up the Yes campaign any time soon.There are also the small matters of a refusenik Prime Minister, Westminster sovereignty, and a potential fight at the UK Supreme Court to consider.In addition, Ms Sturgeon knows she will be pounced on by the opposition and certain sections of the pressshe starts to turn her attention away from the recovery onto the constitution.Throughout the election campaign, her rivals repeatedly said it would be unconscionable for civil service resources to be applied to the case for leaving the UK amid the crisis.By promising to make Covid and the economy her top priority, Ms Sturgeon tacitly went along with this argument.Her allergic reaction to questions about basic issues such as borders and trade, deficit reduction, currency and a central bank, suggests she did so in large part because she doesnrsquot have a strong enough pitch to make yet.The argument from democracy remains the strongest one for independence because it is the most enduring. It applies in all weathers.The idea that the people who live and work in a nation should decide and supply its system of government is straightforward and appealing.However the argument from economics, a cornerstone of Alex Salmondrsquos offer in , is as weak as it has ever been under the SNP.Not only has Brexit scrambled previous assumptions about cross-border trade between Scotland and the rest of the UK, the pandemic has shot the public finances to hell.So for now Ms Sturgeon is holding back, pinned down by her opponents, and leaving her new Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson to focus on rhetoric and process and buttering up the chancelleries of Europe.But that does not mean all is quiet on the constitutional front. Far from it.Since the election, there has been a marked surge in activity by Unionist organisations keen to keep Ms Sturgeon gagged and to fill the vacuum with their own arguments.There have been polls and open letters, commissions and demands for parliamentary inquiries.The key players are Gordon Brownrsquos Our Scottish Future, the anti-Indyref Scotland in Union group, blogger Kevin Haguersquos These Islands, and Scottish Business UK .Being Unionists, they naturally work in concert. Indeed, I understand they have been regularly coordinating their activity to avoid duplicated effort for more than a year as part of a lsquoworking grouprsquo overseen by Mr Hague.So Scotland in Union has led on objecting to a second referendum and critiquing the SNPrsquos record in government SBUK aims to speak for businesses anxious about the recovery and the lack of detail about independence These Islands has led on the state of the public finances, and the harsh measures needed to address them and Our Scottish Future has just upgraded itself from a thinktank to a ldquocampaigning movement aimed at the swing voters of Middle Scotland.Besides their stated objective of confronting the SNP and Ms Sturgeon, there is also a sense that it would be disastrous to rely on Mr Johnson and his cabinet chums to defend the Union, so they have stepped forward instead.It means the First Minister is now confronted by a pincer move.On one side, Holyrood opposition parties are demanding that she ignores independence and tasks her officials to concentrate on all things recovery.If she crosses this first group, she will be accused of playing fast and loose with the economy for the sake of her constitutional ambitions.While on the other side is a nexus of increasingly active Unionist groups demanding she explains exactly how independence will work, complete with all possible facts and figures.If she ignores this group, she will be accused of a guilty silence, of hiding an embarrassing lack of answers or suppressing inconvenient truths.Based on her recent statements, she will play it long and only flesh out her economic case on independence in the run up to an attempt at Indyref.Of course, she and Mr Robertson will still talk up independence when they can, just as Mr Johnson will cheer the Union, not leastTreasury municence is deployed in its defence.But the presence of that Unionist chorus, reinforcing the No vote and sowing doubt across Middle Scotland, is a problem for a muted FM.Between now and another White Paper lie years of coordinated criticism and demands for evidence that will set the scene for the documentrsquos dismissal as a piece of deluded propaganda.True, they would say that anyway.However the Unionist chorus is already mobilising on the political space created by the recovery to make its case and convince others of it too."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12624851.jpg?type=article-full","title":"home-office-vows-deport-indian-men-freed-dawn-raid-glasgow","story":"Lakhvir Singh and Sumit Sehdev, who have lived in Scotland for more than  years, were held in a van by enforcement agents for more than eight hours during a stand-off between local residents and police on Kenmure Street.Neighbours mobilised when the Home Office attempted to lock up the men, from India, in a dawn raid.Despite widespread condemnation of the enforcement action, including from the First Minister, UK immigration officials have vowed to press ahead with the deportations.Singh, a mechanic, and Sehdev, a chef, are suspected of overstaying their visas after they were denied leave to remain.ldquoThey will still be detained and deported at a later date, a Home Office source told the Times.ldquoWe will continue to tackle illegal immigration and the harm it causes.However, the UK Government is likely to face a robust legal challenge.Robina Qureshi, director of charity Positive Action in Housing, said: ldquoWe are exploring what legal actions there are to take action against the Home Office.ldquoItrsquos wrong to call them illegal mdash the Home Office is casting aspersions on men from the Indian community.\"They have been living and working peacefully in the community for years and itrsquos just a matter of not having the right paperwork.\"They are not criminals, they are not costing anybody anything.

In ,  stops were recorded and over , passengers came ashore.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, has moved to reassure the wider Orkney public of the stringent measures being discussed, in order to facilitate the lucrative industry.Dialogue continues between OIC and cruise companies, tourist groups and business networks, and confirmation has still not been received from the Scottish Government on when and how the resumption of cruising in and around Orkney waters will begin, and in what shape.Mr Buck said: “The tourism industry — and this includes cruise — is a vital part of Orkney’s economy, and to not allow it towould adversely affect many people and businesses. I want to encourage an industry that was very important for us beforehand to recover.“This does not mean to say that we will rush into anything, and every step will be in line with and directed by national government and industry guidance and best practice.“It has been over a year now since the last cruise ship called into Orkney, and it is very likely that this will not happen for some time yet. It is impossible for us to put a date on this at present, as we simply do not know the answer — this will be dictated by UK and Scottish Governments — it is for them to decide, and we will be guided by the ongoing advice provided by the Government and Public Health Scotland as restrictions are eased.”Mr Buck stressed that ato pre-pandemic cruise activity in Orkney is not on the cards.Nevertheless, conversations surrounding the management of cruise passengers continue to take place, discussions that are hampered somewhat by uncertainty over the guidance in which the industry will operate.Planning ahead is the sensible option, according to Mr Buck, to start these “green shoots of recovery to make sure that everyone benefits from money being spent here.”“The cruise industry is very aware of reputational damage by not getting this right that is why they are so keen to ensure all the i’s are dotted and the t’s crossed from the outset,” continued Mr Buck.“We are working hard to develop the safety protocols and risk assessments we all believe will be necessary to try and ensure cruise can restart as safely as possible and with stringent safety measures in place.“The discussions we have had with the cruise industry are focused very much on a safe and secure , both for their customers but for Orkney as well. It is in no one’s interests for it to be anything other.“The safety measures will depend on what the regulations are, and the big problem at the moment is that we simply do not have final guidance at this stage of what we are working towards.“The conversations we have had are everything from everyone on board being COVID-vaccinated and proving that, to extremely reduced numbers of passengers on board. We have also discussed passengers not coming ashore or,they do, only allowing bubble tours or a drive around the many tourist sites.”One key aspect of discussions is the increasing success of the vaccination programme, and that cruise tourism is “impeccably planned and managed”.“We will at least have a lot of information and certainty on vaccination status, and ability to plan for passenger arrivals and movements when they do arrive. In any event, we are planning for every opportunity.”He reiterated that the industry has been operating on a “rolling cancellation” programme and that all bookings, at any time, are regarded as provisional until a vessel confirms it is en-route and anchors or docks in Orkney.Mr Buck added: “We remain in the position that we are not allowed to open up for cruise liners and we will not release any spaces until the Scottish Government says we can.“Orkney is my home and I understand people’s concerns — we are all living through the pandemic. But it is vital for this industry to resume — we just need to make sure it is done as safely as we can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That was the simple point.Mr Bowsher later stressed the urgency of the situation early in the pandemic, with deals able to fold within ldquominutes.Emily Lawson, chief commercial officer of NHS England and NHS Improvement, said there were concerns from NHS trusts about the supply of PPE from early March .ldquoThe market was extremely lsquohotrsquo, with deals often failing within minutes of being confirmed, due to competitive bidding by other entities, she said in written evidence.Mr Bowsher argued the environment for buying PPE was a ldquosellersrsquo market, adding: ldquoSellers were able to watch buyers compete for the goods they had available, and compete they did ndash often in unscrupulous ways.The barrister said the DHSC recognised there were ldquoflaws in the process but they required context.Jason Coppel QC, for the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor, previously described the purchase of unusable PPE from PestFix and Ayanda Capital as a ldquocatastrophic waste of public funds.Mr Bowsher said the circumstances of procurement in the pandemic were dferent from typical arrangements.He told the court: ldquoWhile the claimants refer to the purchase of large amounts of PPE and appear to be complaining about that, they have not said the purchasing was unnecessary.ldquoOne has to accept that not everything that was delivered would meet the performance and other standards that one would expect in more placid times.ldquoYou cannot use waste as a concept in this case by looking at one contract or another, you have to look at the whole programme where the endeavour was to obtain as much of the necessary material as possible.The case, being heard remotely by Mrs Justice OrsquoFarrell, will resume on Monday.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one. The comhairle and the health board can do exactly what they like with our island in the face of our expressed concerns. Lewis, by the way, is to have a new care home.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/UIG-TIDY-UP-3-scaled.jpg","title":"uig beach clean volunteers remove two years worth of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCommunity members came out in force across the course of the day with their efforts culminating in a skip-load of rubbish being cleared from Uig beach.Young and old beach buddies worked hard to remove two years’ worth of waste which had accumulated since the last event in .shortly after the beach clean, Ross Watson, the north Scotland site manager for Woodland Trust Scotland said: “It was gloriously warm and we must have had around  people take part in the clean over the course of today.“It was also a great occasion for people to catch up, so there was probably as much chatting as there was litter picking.“We filled the whole skip and had to work really hard to fit everything in. There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help. Getting the message across to them about these matters at an early stage is ideal.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portree-View-scaled.jpg","title":"new skye homes to be sold at a fixed","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine revealed proposals by London-based developer Charlie Garton Jones to build  family homes in Portree on the site of the old golf course off the Struan Road.The plans,approved, will comprise  three-bedroom houses, and five four-bedroom houses, each with a garden and drive, situated on a site of around five acres in total.Mr Garton Jones lodged a planning application with Highland Council in late April this year, and hopes to provide homeowners with an ultrafast one gigabyte broadband connection free of charge for the first five years via the excess capacity the Bracken Hide Hotel will have from the nearby BT exchange.If given the green light, the scheme will be built on land next to where the developer is constructing his -cabin hotel, which is scheduled to open in April .Mr Garton Jones runs an independent estate agency specialising in the sale and rental of residential property in London, which has offices in Westminster, Nine Elms, Cha and Battersea.He also owns the Cow Shed boutique bunkhouse in Uig. report on Mr Garton Jones’ proposals has sparked a heated debate via the paper’s Facebook page over the last few days, attracting more than  comments.Although opinions dfered on the appearance of the houses, the main point of contention centred on whether the homes would be affordable and accessible to local people.Peter Brown commented: “The local community should have the final say. Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3812692.jpg--.jpg?1621502247000\n","title":"moderator on visit to ballykeel","story":"Presbyterian Moderator Rev Dr David Bruce visited Ballykeel Presbyterian last Sunday.

Supporters including Ballymena Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ballymena Rotary Club, Ballymena Road Club, Ballymena Academy, Blair Transport, Lisa Powell in memory of Ruby Powell, W J ’Donnell  Sons, Funeral Directors to name but a few have found virtual ways of raising funds,” said Mrs. Bailes.Christmas Fair at Tullyglass The Annual Christmas Fair held in Tullyglass Hotel is always a highlight of their year’s fundraising.  Group Member Elaine McBride devised an online Virtual Christmas Fair which was very successful and many of our faithful stall holders were able to avail of this opportunity.

The latest initiative is the brand new PCI Youth App.Rev David Thompson, Secretary to the Council for Congregational Le and Witness, explained that one of key elements of fruitful youth ministry is effective communication, which was challenging before Covid-, but has become even more so in present circumstances. The new app will allow congregations to safely and effectively keep in touch with young people, leaders and parents.”With a number of default ‘pages’, which can then be customised by congregations as their own ‘affiliate’ app, it brings everything together in one place, that is easily accessible to everyone involved in a church’s youth ministry. Congregations with less time and resources can start off with a basic template and build as their needs change, but others may want to be a little more adventurous, which makes it not just a useful tool for these times of additional challenge, but one that will continue to be useful long into the future.David Thompson explained that this makes the App very flexible, “As a Council, we were delighted to receive funding from Northern Ireland’s Education Authority to make the App freely available to  congregations and we have really been encouraged by its steady uptake by congregations. We hope that it will prove invaluable in effectively communicating not only what is happening, when and where, especially when our youth groups can’t meet in person.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3813137.jpg--.jpg?1621509111000\n","title":"moy park offer jab at work to employees","story":"Moy Park is facilitating its Northern Ireland workforce with the opportunity to receive the COVID- vaccination at work.

We are grateful to Moy Park for the opportunity to explore the learning from the pilot and potential added value through increased uptake for those who access the vaccine. “Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect our community against serious illnesses.

Vaccination is vital in helping us move through this pandemic and there is no doubt that there are people in Northern Ireland alive today because they have been vaccinated. “Next week we will see further easing of restrictions with the re-opening of licensed and unlicensed premises indoors, the remainder of tourist accommodation and the further relaxation to the rules over visiting indoors. This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice. Iappeal to everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book an appointment. I know there are some younger people that think they don’t need the vaccine but we have seen what this virus can do and with iants now in the mix we all need to protect ourselves and those around us. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride added: “While the risk of severe disease is lower in younger people, some may get very sick. There is much we still have to learn about this virus and post COVID syndrome or “long COVID”, which can be very debilitating for some. In making the decision to get the vaccine you are protecting not only yourself, but also those that matter to you. Every vaccine really does bring us closer, together. People making bookings are asked to be patient, as demand for appointments is expected to be strong. The ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme will continue to be dependent on the availability of vaccine supplies."},{"url":null,"title":"nie networks apologises for cctv cameras misunderstanding in tyrone","story":"Cameras which were put up in the Town Castle Road and Hollyhill in County TyroneEmmet McAleer FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCameras which were put up in the Town Castle Road and Hollyhill in County TyroneTanya Fowles, Local Democracy ReporterMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland ElectricityNetworks has said sorry for undue alarm caused by the appearance of CCTV cameras in mid-Tyrone, assuring people they were for “traffic survey, not surveillance”.It said it did not conduct this type of work and that a Scotland-based consultant was engaged to install the cameras and complete the survey.Read MoreUnauthorised mystery cameras installed around Tyrone vanish after police alertedMembers of the public spotted the devices at Cashel Bridge, Crockanboy Road, Aughnamirigan Road and Greencastle Road.Some were fixed to telegraph poles and other similar structures, apparently without permission.Independent councillor Emmet McAleer contacted a range of agencies, including Fermanagh and Omagh District Council’s planning section, BT and the PSNI, to find out who was responsible, but none had any knowledge of the devices.However, the Crown Estate advised the cameras were erected as part of a traffic survey in connection with a km powerline planning application by NIE Networks.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCameras which were put up in the Town Castle Road and Hollyhill in County Tyrone FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCameras which were put up in the Town Castle Road and Hollyhill in County TyroneThe PSNI said it neither owned nor erected the cameras.A spokesperson added: “Police established this was a private initiative carried out by a contractor in relation to a planning application traffic survey.The contractor has since removed the cameras. The Department for Infrastructure is aware.”The department said a councillor made it aware of the cameras on May .A spokesperson added: “The department is not investigating as the placement of such devices, should they require planning permission, is a matter for the local council to determine.”When contacted, NIE Networks initially said: “Cameras were used for a short period to record traffic volumes on the public road network in relation to a planning application associated with a proposed electricity connection.This is a common form of data collection and all footage is immediately destroyed once the traffic counts are complete.”However, members of the public remained concerned around the policy in place for authorisation of the cameras, privacy and potential human rights breaches.When these points were put to NIE Networks, a spokesperson apologised “for any undue alarm caused as a result of this traffic survey”.They added: “We would reassure members of the public that the use of cameras, such as these to conduct traffic surveys, is standard practice.In this instance, cameras were installed by a specialist traffic consultant for the express purpose of counting vehicles and classying vehicle types on the public road network over a -hour period.“This traffic survey forms an important element of an environmental impact assessment pertaining to a proposed electricity connection associated with a planning application, as required by the Department of Infrastructure.”Further issues were raised with NIE Networks, including the rules around the gathering of information such as number plates and adherence to the Regulation and Investigative Powers Act .NIE Networks said that while a traffic survey of this nature captured vehicle classications and volumes, registrations were not recorded.It was argued that Ripa did not apply because the project was “a traffic survey only, not surveillance”.In respect of the installation of the devices under cover of darkness and apparently without the knowledge of statutory agencies, it emerged a consultant working on the project was delayed when travelling from Scotland on May , which had a knock-on effect on installation.This member of staff then “worked into the night to ensure installation was complete in time for the commencement of planned traffic counts at am the following morning”.NIE Networks stressed the consultancy firm employed for the project was experienced, with contact details clearly displayed on each camera.Councillor McAleer said questions remained despite the statements.“Members of the public remain very concerned and extremely sceptical at this course of events, he added.Had statutory agencies been aware, it would have greatly assuaged suspicions. Instead, it was a revolving door going from agency to agency.“Who is responsible for ensuring recorded data is appropriately disposed of Why were the devices permitted to be fixed as they were, [with] NIE Networks seemingly the only people to know “I will be making further enquiries into this important matter, which has not been handled well at all.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBelfast’s Methodist College receives £.m donation from past pupilFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceProtocol pushing NI to the brink of violence, loyalists tell MPsSon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Lting lockdown: Five things the Executive will consider todayTop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatest NewsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions ‘Some concerns’ over delivery of Johnson  Johnson Janssen vaccinesGaza ceasefire hopes rise as fighting continues for another dayGovernment defends use of ‘VIP lane’ for PPE supply in first wave of CovidByrne warned ministers over Covid rules ‘confusion’ months before Storey funeralLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions ‘Some concerns’ over delivery of Johnson  Johnson Janssen vaccinesGaza ceasefire hopes rise as fighting continues for another dayEuropean marketsto gains amid cryptocurrency revivalGovernment defends use of ‘VIP lane’ for PPE supply in first wave of Covid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He doesn’t have the moral high ground from which to preach.“His own department organised a jobs fair in the Kilcooley Estate with Charter NI which he attended. He met its representatives.

That type of constructive approach would have been appreciated by everyone in North Down.”Mr Farry described the DUP MLA’s comments as “disappointing”. He said: “From time to time, any elected representative has to engage with other politicians who may have pasts. It may have escaped Alex Easton’s notice that the DUP are sharing a joint office with Sinn Fein.“In the community, I will be meeting and engaging with people who have or have had paramilitary connections. However, there is a world of dference between that and directly engaging with paramilitary structures or their front organisation.“Those organisations are a cancer on our society and continue to practice coercive control over many communities.“I am concerned about increased ing of the LCC as the vehicle for loyalist voices, given its clear paramilitary connections, at the expense of other voices being heard.I believe this is corrosive to our democratic process and serves to entrench paramilitary influence in our society rather than see it disappear.”Belfast Most ReadBelfast’s Methodist College receives £.m donation from past pupilFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceProtocol pushing NI to the brink of violence, loyalists tell MPsSon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Lting lockdown: Five things the Executive will consider todayTop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions Byrne warned ministers over Covid rules ‘confusion’ months before Storey funeralRestrictions on outdoor sports damaging children’s mental health, court toldMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageStormont ministers give green light to further wave of Covid- relaxationsLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions ‘Some concerns’ over delivery of Johnson  Johnson Janssen vaccinesGaza ceasefire hopes rise as fighting continues for another dayEuropean marketsto gains amid cryptocurrency revivalGovernment defends use of ‘VIP lane’ for PPE supply in first wave of Covid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBelfast’s Methodist College receives £.m donation from past pupilFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceProtocol pushing NI to the brink of violence, loyalists tell MPsLting lockdown: Five things the Executive will consider todaySon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Top VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatest NewsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictionsAlex KaneOpinionYoung voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldHMS Queen Elizabeth to leave for first deployment early due to bad weatherFour in five over-s in England fully vaccinated, figures suggestRestrictions on outdoor sports damaging children’s mental health, court toldLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictionsBe a tourist at home: Ways to enjoy Northern Ireland this summerAlex KaneOpinionYoung voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldBilly WeirOpinionTrips down memory lane with  Years of Mr Men and Alan Carr’s Epic Celebrity GameshowHMS Queen Elizabeth to leave for first deployment early due to bad weather,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That was the simple point.”Mr Bowsher later stressed the urgency of the situation early in the pandemic, with deals able to fold within “minutes”.Emily Lawson, chief commercial officer of NHS England and NHS Improvement, said there were concerns from NHS trusts about the supply of PPE from early March .“The market was extremely ‘hot’, with deals often failing within minutes of being confirmed, due to competitive bidding by other entities,” she said in written evidence.Mr Bowsher argued the environment for buying PPE was a “sellers’ market”, adding: “Sellers were able to watch buyers compete for the goods they had available, and compete they did – often in unscrupulous ways.”The barrister said the DHSC recognised there were “flaws in the process” but they required context.Jason Coppel QC, for the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor, previously described the purchase of unusable PPE from PestFix and Ayanda Capital as a “catastrophic waste of public funds”.Mr Bowsher said the circumstances of procurement in the pandemic were dferent from typical arrangements.He told the court: “While the claimants refer to the purchase of large amounts of PPE and appear to be complaining about that, they have not said the purchasing was unnecessary.“One has to accept that not everything that was delivered would meet the performance and other standards that one would expect in more placid times.“You cannot use waste as a concept in this case by looking at one contract or another, you have to look at the whole programme where the endeavour was to obtain as much of the necessary material as possible.”The case, being heard remotely by Mrs Justice O’Farrell, will resume on Monday.PATop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictionsEuropean marketsto gains amid cryptocurrency revivalByrne warned ministers over Covid rules ‘confusion’ months before Storey funeralSecond doses of Covid- vaccine for over-s in England, by local authorityBe a tourist at home: Ways to enjoy Northern Ireland this summer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It could have been titled “Ulster’s foremost radical”, because she was, but sadly Ulster’s foremost radical had become Ulster’s almost forgotten radical.Isabella Tod was one of the most notable women in Ulster in the th century and is remembered as a social reformer, a suffragist, a campaigner for women’s rights and a liberal unionist.She was born in Scotland in  of an Ulster-Scots mother and a Scottish father but spent all her adult le in Belfast and described herself as an Ulsterwoman.She contributed to newspapers such as the Northern Whig and was an active member of the Presbyterian Church, but she is remembered especially as a pioneer in such fields as women’s rights, women’s health, women’s education and votes for women.Isabella Tod was involved in the campaign to amend the laws governing the property of married women and was the only woman called to give evidence to the  Select Committee Inquiry on Married Women’s Property, to which she gave evidence at Westminster on July , .This reflected the high esteem in which she was held as a social reformer across the British Isles.It also led her to recognise the importance of securing votes for women and, in , she founded the North of Ireland Women’s Suffrage Society.The society campaigned for votes for women and achieved its first success when an  Act granting city status to Belfast created a new municipal franchise which conferred the vote on persons, rather than men.That was  years before women where in Ireland gained the vote in local government elections.Along with many other progressive women, she was concerned about the abuse of alcohol and, in , with the support of Margaret Byers, the founder of Victoria College, she formed the Belfast Women’s Temperance Association and Christian Workers Union.The plight of women who had fallen into poverty and prostitution was a subject in which she took great interest. Out of this developed the Belfast Prison Gate Mission for Women, which provided support for women emerging from the prison system, and the Victoria Homes for Destitute Girls.Isabella Tod also sought equality for women in the field of education. She was secretary of the Belfast Ladies’ Institute, which provided educational classes for women, and campaigned successfully for Queen’s College Belfastto accept female students.She was also associated with the National Union for the Improving the Education of Women of all Classes.Her interests were regional, national and international. In , she was a contributor to the Journal of International Arbitration and Peace Association.Her last public appearance in Belfast was at a meeting to highlight the problem of genocide in Armenia.A devout Presbyterian and active member of Elmwood Presbyterian Church, she was a Liberal in politics, as indeed were many Presbyterian Ulster-Scots of that time.But she believed in the Union of Great Britain and Ireland and, when the Liberal Party split over the issue of Home Rule, she became an organiser for the Liberal Women’s Unionist Association in Belfast.Isabella Tod was representative of a progressive liberal unionism that was predominantly Presbyterian and Ulster-Scots and, during the last decade of her le, she spoke on unionist s across the United Kingdom.She was a remarkable woman, formidable, forceful, fearless and utterly faithful to the causes she espoused.The last two years of her le were hampered by poor health. When she died in December , at the age of , she was buried in Balmoral Cemetery.Isabella Tod was one of the most signicant Belfast women of all time a woman of national and, arguably, international importance and yet one who has been largely neglected by the city she called home.As Ulster’s foremost female social reformer, is it not time for her to be recognised as an iconic figure whose le and work should be an inspiration to young women today At present, there are conversations under way within Belfast City Council about statues and other commemorative representations in the City Hall.Surely the name of Isabella Tod should be part of that discussion .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadBelfast’s Methodist College receives £.m donation from past pupilFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceProtocol pushing NI to the brink of violence, loyalists tell MPsLting lockdown: Five things the Executive will consider todaySon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Top VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictionsBe a tourist at home: Ways to enjoy Northern Ireland this summerAlex KaneOpinionYoung voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldBilly WeirOpinionTrips down memory lane with  Years of Mr Men and Alan Carr’s Epic Celebrity GameshowHMS Queen Elizabeth to leave for first deployment early due to bad weather,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Derry News has learned that Lilian Seenoi-Barr has put her name forward to replace SDLP councillor Mary Durkan on Derry City  Strabane District Council. Ms Durkan stepped down from the local authority this week after two years in the role and the SDLP can co-opt someone to take her seat. Its understood that the deadline for nominations is tomorrow. When contacted by the Derry News yesterday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr, who is Director of Operations at North West Migrants Forum and has been one of the leading figures in the local Black Lives Matter campaign, confirmed that she has expressed an interest in standing as a councillor. googletag.cmd.push However, she said that it is a democratic process and as such she must wait to see who  puts their name forward. One party insider indicated that it is quite likely Mrs Seenoi-Barr will be selected. The SDLP was asked whether any other candidates have emerged and when the party will make a formal announcement. However, no response was received at the time of publication. In a surprise move, Ms Durkan, who topped the poll in Foyleside in the  local elections, announced her intentions to stand down ‘in light of the limitations in party structures’. At the local elections in , Mrs Seenoi-Barr narrowly missed out on being elected in the Foyleside ward. googletag.cmd.push She has  years of experience working in the community, with a focus on human rights and social justice in Kenya and Northern Ireland. Her work began in Kenya fighting for Maasai women and girls’ rights - advocating for the eradication of Female Genital Mutilation , early forced marriages and access to free primary education for deprived communities. She emigrated to Derry in  and since then has been involved in promoting and protecting minority rights in Northern Ireland through political engagement, dispute resolution and reconciliation. At first, Mrs Seenoi-Barr struggled to integrate due to the lack of services and support for migrant, refugees and asylum seekers in the city.     Determined that other Black and Minority Ethnic residents should have better support, she worked to establish and build the North-West Migrants Forum. Despite a harsh economic climate, she secured funding and sustained a migrant centre in the city, increasing visibility of and a leline for migrants. She has been a prominent figure in the local Black Lives Matter Movement, highlighting racial inequality in the North. Following the murder of black American man, George Floyd, a rally was organised by Mrs Seenoi-Barr in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Staff from Rosemount Resource Centre have written a letter of no confidence to Derry City  Strabane District Council which questions the suitability of a ‘new management committee’. Ten workers who signed the no confidence letter say they have provided a collective  years’ service to the local community. A list of grievances and concerns are laid out in the letter over two and a half pages. They include allegations of bullying and harassment in the workplace, mis-use of funding, closed Annual General Meetings , concerns of ‘family collusion’ and a lack of knowledge in terms of financial reports. googletag.cmd.push In addition, it details the removal of committee members from an investigating  to ‘manipulate the outcome of grievances’, ‘victimisation’ of staff and exclusion of the community from decision-making. The letter says that all complaints can be backed up with emails, minutes and testimonials. “Staff are now feeling unhappy, vulnerable and threatened to be in their place of work. “This is having a devastating impact on our health, leading to us being unsure of what our future holds as community workers,” the letter adds. In conclusion, the staff say the situation will not be tolerated any more. The Derry News has since viewed correspondence from management which was sent to signatories of the ‘no confidence’ letter. googletag.cmd.push They have been called to an investigation in relation to their ‘participation in a letter sent to public representatives and others containing serious allegations’. It aims to establish facts and gather evidence relating to the allegations. Iniduals were given the right to trade union representation at the meeting or they can be accompanied by a colleague who is not involved in the investigation. Those invited to attend were told to keep the investigation confidential and thatthey breached that order it could be considered a disciplinary matter. Representing staff, Niall McCarroll of Unison said: “Workers at Rosemount Resource Centre should be valued as important stakeholders in how it is run and to ensure it meets the needs of the local community.”     Derry City  Strabane District Council was asked what action is being taken in relation to the allegations made. In response, a council spokesperson said that it is aware of concerns and is in the process of ‘collating and compiling information’ as part of a preliminary assessment of the situation. The spokesperson added that it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bastion Community Garden in the Fountain was this evening named at the Community Garden of the Year for the UK. The competition was run by the world-famous Cha Garden Show in conjunction with the BBCs The One Show. The winner was announced on the show a short time ago. The inspiration behind the local garden project is Fountain community worker Jeanette Warke. Her vision several years ago to turn an empty piece of land in the area into a community allotment was soon turned into a reality.  The garden is now at the heart of the community and is used by a large amount of people to grow their own food. googletag.cmd.push A crew from The One Show was in Derry recently to film the story behind the Fountain garden. Jeanette thought they were filming because the garden had been shortlisted for the award. However, she was stunned when she was told that they had actually won. Among those who have congratulated Jeanette and her team are her musical hero Daniel ODonnell and gardening guru Monty Don. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Desertmartin, Glen and Derry player Emma Kelly took over as the Saffrons manager on the eve of the new season. She played camogie for Ballinascreen and football with Desertmartin alongside current Derry players Nuala Brown and Tomaisina Cassidy. When the Martins folded for a season, she played for Glen with current Derry players Caoimhe Kirkpatrickand Danielle Kivlehan. In the Derry colours, she soldiered with Ciara Moore who is still part of Odhran McNeillys Oakleaf plans. When it looked like Derry werent going to have a team, she moved to play for the Saffrons and was later part of their  All-Ireland junior winning team. googletag.cmd.push After not being part of manager Dee McConvilles plans for this season, she had resigned herself to the fact her county career was over, while still playing for St Pauls, to whom she transferred when moving to Belfast for work. When McConville stepped down as manager on the cusp of the league, Kellys phone was hopping with players urging her to take the job, followed by a call from the Antrim Chairperson asking her to take on the role in an interim basis. “So it is sort of forced retirement...I am hardly going to put myself on,” Kelly jokes. “I turned  last month, so it was about time somebody stepped into the roleanyway. googletag.cmd.push “I coached most of the senior squad going up through underage,” Kelly said of her time in charge of ious Antrim Development squads. Kelly enlisted the help of Down All-Ireland winning forward Kyla Trainor as Head Coach and the duo got to work with a trial process to get a squad of players drawn up for the new season. Now confirmed as manager, Emma looks ahead to a five year plan of development. “We opened up the trials to every club, regardless of ision. If girls want to trial for a county team, then they should be given the opportunity and it was the same in Derry when I was playing,” Kelly points out.     She listed Antrim and Derry under the same umbrella, sleeping giants of the ladies game. There is youthful tinge to the Saffrons squad. There are five current minors on board, with a group of talented players still in their first year of minor left to their own grade and to focus on their studies for now. “With me out, Cathy Carey is the oldest...she ticks that box now,” laughs Emma. “The next oldest would be  or , so we have a range all the way down to  or , so it is a good mix.” Going down the years, there wouldve been a core of players putting their shoulder to the wheel of Antrim football. Others, came and went, with some coming in at the last minute on the basis of a reputation earned where. The new management duo have a dferent outlook, based on their experiences on squads down the years. “We know what we hated when we were playing, you dont like people walking into ,” Kelly states. “We have stamped that out. If youre not committing,you havent havent been at training and havent told us...youre gone. It is as simple of that.” The starting team and squad will be picked based on Antrim performances. The seven of her St Pauls clubmates have been told they will be judged on their commitment and application to the county. “I dont care who you think you are or what you think you are, were out to win and put the best team out,” Kelly adds. “You will be taken off and put on as we see fit and I think they are buying into it. There is a buzz, that things are going to be done right and people arent going to walk out. “We are putting changes in place that we have girls there who want to play for the county. We have  girls who will commit to being there, they mightnt be the best  in the county talent wise, butyou are the best in the county that are going to commit and work together at bringing the county on, thats the way we are going.” Emma, who works in Sports Development, looks on the Antrim job as a five-year project. Getting out of Division  figures in her thoughts. “We obviously want to compete this year, we came in late but there is a good buzz and a lot of talent there, so we will hopefully compete well. It is a building process and there is a lot of talented young girls coming though. “Theyll be playing along with the likes ofMcFarland, Tosh , Cathyand Aine Tubridy, who will all bring them along in the setup.” Derry and Antrim will meet in the Ulster final later in the season and Sunday will be a marker on how the season will fare out. With a mixture of both counties, in opposite corners, it will be an interesting Sunday ahead. LISTEN: Interview with Derrys Anna Frizelle.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was as though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Ardglass.jpg","title":"Ardglass fishermen sign up to marine litter project  ","story":"A NEW initiative has been launched which aims to reduce the amount of litter in the sea.Spearheaded by the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, a number of trawler owners based in Ardglass have signed up for the new lsquoFishing for Litterrsquo scheme designed to help protect marine le.The village hosted a launch of the new scheme with trawler skippers and Fishery Harbour Authority officials last Friday and were joined by representatives from the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Association.The lsquofishing for litterrsquo scheme is designed to reduce the amount of marine litter by physically removing it, with the new initiative also highlighting the importance of good waste management amongst the fleet.Participating vessels are given hardwearing bags to collect marine litter that is caught in their nets during their normal fishing activities, with the waste subsequently deposited at participating harbours on the quayside where they are moved to a dedicated skip for recycling or disposal which has a positive impact on the environment.The scheme is being launched at the three Co Down ports of Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel with fishermen highlighting their frustration about marine litter which can be found in rivers, lakes and seas across the globe.A walk along any coastline will reveal a rainbow of colour where there should just be sand and stones with plastic the real reason that marine litter is such a big issue.Jenny Lau mdash the Fishery Harbour Authorityrsquos environment officer who was in Ardglass last Friday mdash explained that a plastic bottle is typically used for less than  minutes before being discarded, after which it takes  years to break down.ldquoEven then, it will break down into smaller and smaller pieces known as micro plastics which are still harmful. This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The DUP ‘family’ ignored his last column, and refused to make him leaderI wanted to make sure they were all proper, true, reliable friends and not Christopher Stalfords.Christopher is the ‘friend’ of Arlene Foster who helped to oust her, neglected to talk to her in advance of the coup, and has failed to phone her since her resignation. The rough and tumble of friendship eh    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Given Edwin Poots’ traditional religious beliefs, two groups of people will be disappointed he is the new leader — nationalists and paleontologistsI’m not saying Arlene is being given the cold shoulder by her former colleagues but they are treating her like she was Neil Lennon at a Rangers street party.Christopher said the DUP operates as a family — clearly the Sopranos rather than the Waltons. Anyway, the DUP ‘family’ ignored my last column, refused to make me leader and instead had an election last week. They counted all the votes and the people have spoken!!So well done Edwin. Your election means the DUP now says No Surrender to science!Well, three dozen of them spoke. And Edwin beat Jeffrey by  votes to  votes. If it had been  votes each apparently it would have gone to an Irish League penalty shoot-out where you get extra marks for stepping over the line. Andit was still a draw after that, it would have gone to a march-off. God knows what Protestant teachers they would impart to Catholic children in biologyNineteen out of  amounts to exactly % of the votes. And as we all know from recent experience % of a vote is a ringing endorsement of any project. So it is highly unlikely that anything could possibly go wrong for the DUP. Part of me is delighted that Jeffrey didn’t get the job. I mean I do like to recycle gags but I remember doing my first ever ‘Jeffrey Donaldson looks like Daniel O’Donnell’ joke  years ago and there were people still doing it last week online. So well done Edwin.There are however two groups of people who will be bitterly disappointed that Edwin is the new leader — nationalists and paleontologists. Oh and astro-physicists. And geologists. And fans of the Big Bang Theory — the sitcom and the actual theory. Yes, it’s official, the DUP now says No Surrender to science. Brendan Behan famously said that the first item on in the agenda of every Irish republican party was the split. Unionists tend to avoid formal splits but they are in a state of flux. The DUP is unlikely to split.And the TUV can’t split, on the grounds that a split requires members to form two factions and the TUV have barely enough for one. In factJim Allister wants to retire, according to party rules, he has to tender his resignation to Stephen Nolan. And the UUP won’t split. To be fair they have had quite a smooth leadership transition from Steve Aitken to Doug Beattie. Remember Steve  Steve joined Arlene several weeks ago in demanding that the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne must resign for alleged incompetence. Of course the irony of someone being accused of being no good at their job by two MLAs surely deserves more than ‘pot, kettle, black’. And as a sign of the contemporary power and influence of unionism, sure enough, six weeks after demanding that Simon resign both Arlene and Steve had resigned. Schadenfreude is an ugly emotion butI were Simon Byrne I’d be dancing round my office singing ‘Arlene’s on fire’ and ‘Ste-vie lives in a sunken submarine’. So Doug is now the new UUP leader and is determined to attract more liberal voters to the party. In fact he’s already renamed UUP headquarters the Edward Carson Wellness Centre. He was going to get Meghan and Harry to open it until he realised that they were separatists rather than unionists.• We can’t have Protestants teaching their chemistry in Catholic schoolsOn the plus side, there were things to celebrate this week.Northern Ireland has reached a million vaccinations. A million! This is a great achievement. Robin Swann should be walking like a man who’s  feet tall. Or six feet. Or over five feet anyway.And two Northern Ireland men, Brendan Rodgers and Jonny Evans, won the FA Cup — there were a few other people involved but it was basically them. Plus the Northern Ireland Assembly finally voted to remove the loophole that meant that schools could legally discriminate on religious grounds when appointing teachers. It was revealed this week that only % of teachers in Catholic schools are Protestant and % of teachers in mainly Protestant schools are Catholic.To be fair this % is still more than when I went to my Catholic schools. It’s % more than when I went. I’m all for integrated education but I can’t help being concerned that removing this loophole could be unhelpful.We can’t have Protestants running around Catholic schools teaching their Protestant French and their Protestant chemistry. It doesn’t bear thinking about what they would get up to in the history lessons. And God knows what filth they would impart to the good Catholic children in biology.

It is the greatest diminution of British sovereignty since a previous Conservative Prime Minister signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement  years ago.In my address I further said that the Covid pandemic has had a detrimental impact on the government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda and by agreeing a border in the Irish Sea he has made a conscious decision to ‘level-down’ Northern Ireland.Lord Rogan, Westminster SW——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area.

There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our bike share schemes are there to benefit the whole community, which is why we want to hear from as many people as possible.Nextbike docking stations have to be close to popular destinations such as existing transport links, job centres, supermarkets and other shops be in an area of high footfall be highly visible and easy to find have enough space to allow safe movement of pedestrians and people with limited mobility and be accessible by van or bike trailer to allow the nextbike service team to maintain the bikes and stations.     Final decisions will be made based on the above criteria, in addition to the ability to get power to the locations, which is determined by power providers.Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe nextbike e-bike hire scheme in Penarth has proved extremely successful.\"Since its launch, the hire of the bikes has been steadily increasing.ldquoWith the onset of summer, we have implemented a new docking station at Cosmeston, and very soon there will be a new docking station in Sully.\"I am convinced the scheme will only go from strength to strength.ldquoTwo additional docking stations in Dinas Powys will complement the existing nextbike network within the Vale of Glamorgan and provide an additional sustainable transport link between these three areas.\"I would encourage Dinas Powys residents to respond to the consultation as itrsquos important they are located where they are accessible to as many people as possible.Penarthrsquos existing stations are located at the Esplanade, Llandough Hospital, Windsor Road, Penarth Train Station, the Barrage and the recently-installed Cosmeston.While the Penarth bikes can currently only be rented and ed to Penarth stations, the ambition is to eventually link the scheme to nextbikersquos Cardf fleet, meaning commuters will be able to use the e-bikes to make the journey between the town and the city with ease.E-bikes are a combination of a conventional bike with a motor that take some of the effort out of pedalling for the rider. With top speeds of km per hour, the e-bikes can cover greater distances in less time and with less effort than conventional cycles.E-bike rental costs pound per  minutes for customers with a monthly or annual membership, or pound per  minutes on a pay as you ride basis.The consultation runs until May .

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That was the simple point.Mr Bowsher later stressed the urgency of the situation early in the pandemic, with deals able to fold within ldquominutes.Emily Lawson, chief commercial officer of NHS England and NHS Improvement, said there were concerns from NHS trusts about the supply of PPE from early March .ldquoThe market was extremely lsquohotrsquo, with deals often failing within minutes of being confirmed, due to competitive bidding by other entities, she said in written evidence.Mr Bowsher argued the environment for buying PPE was a ldquosellersrsquo market, adding: ldquoSellers were able to watch buyers compete for the goods they had available, and compete they did ndash often in unscrupulous ways.The barrister said the DHSC recognised there were ldquoflaws in the process but they required context.Jason Coppel QC, for the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor, previously described the purchase of unusable PPE from PestFix and Ayanda Capital as a ldquocatastrophic waste of public funds.Mr Bowsher said the circumstances of procurement in the pandemic were dferent from typical arrangements.He told the court: ldquoWhile the claimants refer to the purchase of large amounts of PPE and appear to be complaining about that, they have not said the purchasing was unnecessary.ldquoOne has to accept that not everything that was delivered would meet the performance and other standards that one would expect in more placid times.ldquoYou cannot use waste as a concept in this case by looking at one contract or another, you have to look at the whole programme where the endeavour was to obtain as much of the necessary material as possible.The case, being heard remotely by Mrs Justice OrsquoFarrell, will resume on Monday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government defends use of  uVIP lane u for PPE supply in first wave of Covid article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Anyone born between    and    can book an appointment at one of the Trust vaccination centres across Northern Ireland. Vaccine supplies remain limited and as a result there will be approximately , slots available weekly, therefore people awaiting their jab are asked to be patient.Additional slots for the following weeks will be released every Thursday. In line with the latest JCVI advice, anyone under the age of  can book their vaccination at a trust centre in order to receive the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine. If you are under  and wish to make an informed decision to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine there are slots available at the SSE arena and at participating community pharmacies.

Details of participating pharmacies and how to book are online at: covid-.hscni.net community-pharmacy-covid--vaccination-service. Health Minister Robin Swannsaid: “This announcement today will be welcome news for those within the age range and is a further testament to the successful delivery of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. Vaccination is vital in helping us move through this pandemic and there is no doubt that there are people in Northern Ireland alive today because they have been vaccinated. “Next week we will see further easing of restrictions with the re-opening of licensed and unlicensed premises indoors, the remainder of tourist accommodation and the further relaxation to the rules over visiting indoors. This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice. Iappeal to everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book an appointment. I know there are some younger people that think they don’t need the vaccine but we have seen what this virus can do and with iants now in the mix we all need to protect ourselves and those around us. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride added: “While the risk of severe disease is lower in younger people, some may get very sick. There is much we still have to learn about this virus and post COVID syndrome or “long COVID”, which can be very debilitating for some. In making the decision to get the vaccine you are protecting not only yourself, but also those that matter to you. Every vaccine really does bring us closer, together. People making bookings are asked to be patient, as demand for appointments is expected to be strong. The ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme will continue to be dependent on the availability of vaccine supplies.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dccdadfebbaef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eaecbabfdffbeeca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
