However, it\u0027s reassuring to see that convictions have decreased since last year and hopefully they will continue to do so year on year.\u0027Drink or drug driving can be damaging not only to your licence, but also to yourself and others - so if you are doubting your sobriety, don\u0027t put yourself or others at risk by driving, even if it seems like an inconvenience at the time.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/10/12/053D94F3000007D0-6576589-image-a-161_1547124376027.jpg","title":"Meghan patron National Theatre","story":"    The Duchess of Sussex walks through clothes racks with Lady Juliet Hughes-Hallett, chair of Smart Works, in London today          Meghan, Duchess of Sussex looks at bags with Smart Works charity chair Lady Juliet Hughes-Hallett in West London today          The Duchess of Sussex puts on a bracelet on Patsy Wardally, during her visit to Smart Works charity in West London today      Layer up like Meghan in an oversized coat by Oscar de la RentaFind it at Farfetch!It\u0026#39s back to work for the Duchess of Sussex today, whose first engagement of 2019 is a visit to Smart Works in London.

She\u0027s a natural and has already made a big difference.\u0027It was her office which contacted the charity, which provides women with five high quality pieces of clothing for their interview, one-on-one coaching, a further follow-up session with another outfit and the opportunity to join the Smart Works Network, further developing their professional and personal development.The women are allowed to keep all the clothes, which are suggested from them by stylists and donated both from iniduals and big brands such as Burberry, Whistles, M\u0026ampS, Evans and Hobbs. After she arrived, Meghan sat down with Ms Stephens, Lady Hughes-Hallett, interview coach Marine Novis, dressing volunteer Louise Warner and two Smart Works success stories in Sarah Barrett and Ashoka Davey.Meghan told them: \u0027It\u0027s not just donating your clothes and seeing where they land but really being part of each other\u0027s success stories as women.\u0027So that\u0027s in the tools that you give, the interview prep that\u0027s happening, that every piece of it... you do an edit or decide what you\u0027re going to send to Smart Works.\u0027It\u0027s not just hand-me-downs, it\u0027s saying \u0027OK this is the blazer that I wore that helped me land that interview and I want this to be the piece that helps this woman have that part of her story\u0027 so to know as a woman coming in that you have so many other women believing in you on all the next phases, it\u0027s this piece that makes it so special.\u0027New mother Sarah Barrett, 38, from Islington, North London, told Meghan that the Monsoon coat she was given helped her get a new reception role in her old school.She said: \u0027Coming here gave me the confidence to be able to change my career.\u0027Meghan replied: \u0027It\u0027s amazingly how you feel when you\u0027re in here. It\u0027s one of those things immediately when you come in... is incredible. It turns it around in a second. You come in feeling so low but you\u0027re reminded of your value.\u0027Meghan giggled as Sarah exclaimed: \u0027You feel like royalty!\u0027Ms Barrett continued: \u0027The experience coming here saved me. I wasn\u0027t feeling so good about myself and I came out of here feeling a million dollars.\u0027She also told the Duchess she\u0027d recently had a baby, Grayson, 16 months. \u0027Congratulations\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027And congratulations back to you\u0027 laughed Ms Barrett.Meghan also highlighted how important the interview coaching was.\u0027And in the second phase of it, doing the interview prep is so key, giving all these women the tools to make eye contact, to remind this company why they would be lucky to have them. It\u0027s so key this kind of trading you do to help them feel confident.\u0027Meghan then got hands on with two ladies, Mrs Wardally and 50-year-old Dionne Johnson in the wardrobe room.She told Mrs Wardallyshe \u0027loved\u0027 her first green dress and told her the wrap style was great as \u0027you can play around with it\u0027.Meghan then chose a Hobbs cape coat to go with a different red dress for Patsy, a handbag, bracelet and earrings.Mother-of-three Mrs Wardally had trained as a plumber but had stopped work 16 years ago to look after her autistic daughter.She told the duchess how hard it had been, but Smart Works had helped her land a job at Gatwick airport as a passenger services agent.Ms Stephens said afterwards: \u0027She\u0027s a natural.

Meghan\u0027s first four patronages represent a key step for the duchess, who is still in her first year as a newbie royal.According to the royal family\u0027s website: \u0027Royal patronages add status to an organisation, and visits and involvement from a royal patron can often bring much-needed publicity.\u0027Meghan will have been inundated with requests from charities asking for her support since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May. Members of the royal family each receive hundreds of pleas each year.Most royals tends to limit their patronages to a manageable number to allow them to devote enough time to each.The Duchess of Cambridge has 17 and has focused on early intervention for children.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have more than 1,000 patronages between them, many of which were inherited from previous monarchs.According to he royal family\u0027s website, the most influential member regarding patronages is still the Queen.\u0027The Queen\u0027s patronage carries the most weight, and Her Majesty receives the most requests for patronages of all the members of the royal family,\u0027 the site says.          Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charitiesIn 2016, following her 90th birthday, the Queen stepped down from 25 patronages, including the NSPCC, which was taken over by the Countess of Wessex, and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which went to Kate.          The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700sNow she has handed two over to Meghan, with the duchess becoming patron of the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.But the monarch - the nation\u0027s longest reigning sovereign - still has 599 patronages or associations. Philip stepped down as patron or president of more than a dozen organisations when he turned 90 in 2010.He was patron, president or a member of 785 organisations at his retirement in 2017, and continues his association with them behind the scenes.Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charities.She resigned her position as patron or president from all but six - Centrepoint, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National Aids Trust, London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital.Those she stepped down from included Help the Aged, Barnardos, Relate and the Parkinson\u0027s Disease Society.The princess - William and Harry\u0027s mother who died in a car crash in 1997 - said she made her decision \u0027with great sadness\u0027, but wanted to concentrate her efforts on fewer causes.The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700s.The organisation was concerned with architectural and art history, conservation and heraldry.It still exists today and and the Queen\u0027s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, is its patron.Patronages generally reflect a royal\u0027s interests, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society after both her mother and grandmother died due to the brittle bone disease."},{"url":null,"title":"Rare look homes rock stars Bob Dylan Keith Richards Cher","story":"    The intimate photos of some of the world\u0027s most adored musical icons, are compiled in the new photo book Rock Stars at Home But the new book Rock Stars at Home offers a peek inside the homes of some of music\u0027s biggest stars, compiled into a new photo book by authors Chris Charlesworth, Eddi Fiegel, Bryan Reesman, Colin Salter, Simon Spence, Daryl Easlea released next Tuesday.   One photo captures a strained Tina and Ike Turner inside their small 1950s home in Inglewood after moving to California from St. Louis, hinting at their tumultuous relationship which would lead the Proud Mary singer to initiate a orce and put the house for sale after a particularly volatile fight in 1976. Appearing dazed and disheveled, a young Keith Richards stares into the camera with his West Sussex mansion in the background - the same home where Mick Jagger and his girlfriend Marianne Faithfull were tripping on acid in 1967, leading to Richard and Jagger being arrested and sparking wild rumors of an orgy.  And Sonny and Cher seem at ease with each other at the estate that rising star Cher vowed to buy from Tony Curtis after attending a party at the palatial Italianate Renaissance villa at 141 South Carolwood Drive in Hollywood, later purchasing it from Curtis for $750,000 ($4 million today). These intimate images allow fans a rare look inside the private lives of music legends.  Bob Dylan          Bob Dylan paid $12,000 in 1963 for this rambling 11-room Arts and Crafts house called Hi Lo Ha that was in the hills above Woodstock.

which is intended to ensure no-one is made worse off by taking jobs - was not \u0027compassionate\u0027 enoughMs Rudd also signalled that an end is in sight to the longstanding benefit freeze introduced by former chancellor George Osborne in 2016, telling Sky News she did not expect it to be renewed in 2020.She said it was not \u0027reasonable\u0027 to impose the two-child cap - intended to force claimants to make decisions on whether they can afford a third child in the same way as those in work - on families which already have more than two offspring.Other changes will make the system more \u0027inidual\u0027, tailoring it to claimants\u0027 needs by making payments more regular or paying rent money direct to landlords.She said she also would build a \u0027nudge\u0027 into

It was. I\u0027m just reinforcing that.\u0027Ms Rudd defended Mr Osborne\u0027s benefit freeze, saying it had been right to introduce it in an age of austerity.She told Sky: \u0027The whole point about the three-year benefit freeze was making sure that people on low incomes had the same rises as people on benefits.\u0027This was a time when inflation was very low and it was the right thing to do at the time, given that we also had the massive debts that the country had inherited from Labour.\u0027It was the right policy at the time, it\u0027s got one more year to run, I look forward to it coming off.\u0027Pressed on when this might be, she added: \u0027It has one more year to run ...

And how without tennis, which has been part of his life since the age of three when he first picked up a racquet, will he fill his days?The story of Sir Andrew Barron Murray OBE is not just about the incredible mental strength that has made him one of the greatest sportsmen Britain has produced — according to some yesterday ‘our greatest sportsman ever’ — but also about a tougher struggle to overcome the traumas of childhood — and to be liked.This, remember, is a man who, when he was just eight years old, hid behind a desk as a deranged gunman rampaged through his primary school in the Scottish border town of Dunblane, slaughtering 16 children and a teacher in March 1996. Two years later he was coping with his parents’ orce and then at 15 he tore himself away from home to live alone in Barcelona to take advantage of better coaching facilities.As a professional player, he has pushed himself to the limits of human endurance during training, living like a monk before major tournaments — and making countless other sacrifices to be the best.For the past decade he has carried the nation’s tennis hopes on his muscular shoulders, winning three Grand Slams (two Wimbledon and the U.S. title), two Olympic gold medals, and securing Great Britain’s first Davis Cup triumph since 1936 virtually single-handedly.          Andy Murray poses with his medal at the 2012 OlympicsIt has brought him career prize money of £48 million and a raft of lucrative endorsement deals that have boosted his wealth to £83 million, according to the most recent Sunday Times Rich List.And Murray has achieved all this in an era that has produced the finest crop of players ever to grace the game — Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. It certainly places him at the very heart of our sporting pantheon and his star shines more brightly when we remember his inauspicious beginnings, and the self-destructive flaws, that threatened to sabotage his success.When Murray started playing, tennis was very much a middle-class, Home Counties sport and its administrators never imagined a champion might emerge from the far North.But with his exceptional talent and an unswerving self-belief that saw him yelling instructions at his much older club doubles partner when he was eight, he has completely changed the tennis establishment’s mind-set, so that now every talented child, regardless of background, has a chance.That is certainly a legacy he can be proud of. But along the way he put many a nose out of joint. He didn’t just curse at umpires, like McEnroe, he let rip with volleys of foul-mouthed abuse.He soon started collecting criticism for his stroppy on-court posturing — ‘like some second-rate Caledonian cage-fighter,’ as one Wimbledon figure put it.          Andy Murray married Kim Sears in 2015Yet perhaps he was owed some understanding from critics, a realisation that this was a youngster shaped by a difficult upbringing, acquiring, in the process, a certain dourness.Murray has rarely spoken about the deaths of his classmates. But he did open up about the harrowing event in Dunblane ahead of his first Wimbledon win in 2013.‘At the time, you have no idea how tough something like that is. As you start to get older you realise,’ he said. ‘The thing that is nice now, the whole town, they recovered from it so well.‘It wasn’t until a few years ago that I started to research it and look into it a lot because I didn’t really want to know. It’s just nice that I’ve been able to do something the town is proud of.’During the early years he did revel in his status as the poster boy of Scottishness, not Britishness. Wimbledon, remember, was still basking in the nearly career of Tim Henman who epitomised tennis’s Home Counties tradition.Beating Federer for the first time in 2006 and ending Henman’s seven-year run as British No 1, began to change things — although he came to regret joshing with Henman over who he’d be supporting during the 2006 football World Cup and thus revealing his anti-England prejudice. It certainly damaged Murray’s image with the public and media for a time.That began to change in his early 20s. The architect of this metamorphosis was a new manager, pop-impresario Simon Fuller, the creator of the TV show Pop Idol.His influence saw Murray photographed by Mario Testino for Vogue and later winning plaudits for his self-deprecating turns for Comic Relief.Of course, there was always another far more important figure in the Murray corner — his formidable mother Judy. It’s no secret that for many years she was the person he listened to more than anyone. If Murray disturbed Middle England, his mother sitting in the players’ box, jaw set, eyes aflame and fists pumping, positively affronted it.          Judy Murray (pictured above) had dreams of becoming a pro tennis star The truth of their relationship is complex. Murray’s autobiography, Hitting Back, revealed that Judy, a star amateur player, ‘hated the whole birth thing’ and found the early years of raising Murray and his older brother and fellow tennis professional, Jamie, difficult. Gone forever were Judy’s dreams of making it as a pro herself. ‘I felt completely trapped,’ she says. ‘I was stuck in the house with these two little tiddlers, and it was an absolute nightmare.’And she, too, lived through the terror of Dunblane. ‘I was one of hundreds of mums queuing at the school gates waiting to find out what had happened, not knowing if your children were alive or not,’ she later recalled.Divorce from her sons’ father, Willie, a retail manager in Dunblane, soon followed, and it wasn’t until the brothers began showing a talent for tennis that Judy seems to have discovered the true joys of parenthood.To some extent, she may have simply been transferring her ambitions to her children.Murray broke into the world top ten in 2007 and reached his first Grand Slam final a year later, losing to Nadal at the U.S. Open.By now he was the darling of the Centre Court crowd. So-called Henman Hill at Wimbledon, where there are TV screens for fans to see the action on Centre Court, was now dubbed Murray Mount. Then in 2012, in a splendid summer of British sport Murray became the first man to reach the Wimbledon final for more than seven decades.It was the year of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and it seemed odds-on certain that the stars had aligned so that Murray would prevail.But he lost to Federer, sobbing on court in defeat. His breakdown endeared him even more to the public and a month later he returned to Centre Court to beat the Swiss and win an Olympic gold medal. It seemed to be a turning point. Later that summer he won his first Grand Slam with a dramatic five-set victory over Djokovic in the U.S. Open.A year later came sporting history and a Wimbledon hoodoo was finally broken as he beat Djokovic in straight sets to become the first British man to win Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936 and the entire nation celebrated with him.By now there was another, more glamorous figure in his corner, Kim Sears, leggy, blonde daughter of player-turned-coach Nigel Sears.Her peaches and cream complexion and stylish presence completed Andy’s transformation to darling of SW19.She changed his wardrobe, tamed his hair and yes, even got him to smile.They shared a £5 million, six bedroom house in Oxted, Surrey, with two adorable border terriers, Maggie May and Rusty, to whom they were devoted. Their engagement was announced in 2014, nine years after they started dating, and the following year they were married at Dunblane Cathedral, the reception held at the nearby Cromlix House hotel which Murray had bought for £1.8 million in 2013.More success followed with the Davis Cup and then in 2016 a second Wimbledon title.But following his knighthood last year, his hip problem worsened. After limping out of Wimbledon last summer, he decided to undergo surgery in a bid to save his career — but, it seems, to no avail.What now then for our greatest ever tennis player? Family life will be central. He and Kim, an illustrator, have two young daughters, Sophia and Edie, and he described the birth of his first child in February 2016 as ‘the best moment of my life’, later admitting, as his family grew, that ‘for the first time ever, tennis is probably more of a distraction from my home life than the other way around’.His hotel purchase, meanwhile, has shown, he is an aspiring businessman. With two partners, he has also set up 77 Sports Management, an agency designed to mentor and manage budding stars across the sporting spectrum.But as that emotional press conference made clear what Sir Andy really likes to do is hit balls across a net — and win.‘I’m not really too sure what I love about tennis. I just enjoy winning. Winning is the most amazing thing,’ he once said.Now he needs to find something to replace it. As for the rest of us summer will never be the same again.  My brave pal Andy must play one final Wimbledon By Boris BeckerThis is a heartbreaking moment — not just for Andy and the tennis-crazy Murray family, but for the entire world of tennis.What makes him so special is that not only has he competed at the highest level of the game, but he has won again and again and again.Yes, he is the greatest British player since Fred Perry. But he’s also one of the greatest players of the past decade.          Boris Becker (pictured above) said Andy Murray needs to play one last Wimbledon final Andy has had the misfortune — although I hope he’ll eventually come to see it as a privilege — to play at a time when tennis has been dominated by two of the greatest players the game has ever seen — Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal — with a third, Novak Djokovic, not far behind.That’s why, for me, his greatest achievement was his 2016 end-of-season win over Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals which made Andy the world No 1.It was a very painful moment for me, because I was Novak’s coach. But it was a stunning and richly deserved triumph for Andy.          Roger Federer is one of the greatest tennis players the world has ever seen, according to Boris Becker As we now know, though, it was an achievement that came at tremendous physical cost.For while the muscular Nadal punched his way to the top and the elegant Federer finessed his way there, Andy had to fight all the way, contesting every point with blood, sweat and those famous Murray tears.He played that way because he had to. I say this with the utmost respect but the truth is that he isn’t the most naturally gifted player. Yet he has a massive heart and, after a great deal of gym work, the physical strength of a lion. Unlike players who rely on their serve, Andy’s game centres on his speed and footwork.That is why he needs to be 100 per cent fit. It’s no good for him to be 75 per cent.          Rafael Nadal rose to the top of tennis through his playing Andy — ‘Sir Andy’, as I call him when I want to tease him — plays up to his image as ‘boring’ but, in fact, he’s anything but. In private, he’s funny, tremendously well liked and a man of principle.It shouldn’t be forgotten that he was the first top male player to employ a female coach — the French former world No 1 Amelie Mauresmo — and that he’s been a consistent champion of gender equality, campaigning for equal prize money for male and female players.But now Andy has reached the awful moment that all top sportsmen and women dread, when they realise that their worn-out body will no longer allow them to compete at the very top level.Every one of us has only one body. And we must look after it. I retired after breaking my ankle at the same age — 31 — as Andy is now. In hindsight, I should have stopped earlier but, in the heat of the moment, I always wanted to play the next round or the next event. Today, I’m paying a heavy price. I have two new hips. My right ankle isn’t perfect. I have a limp. These are my battle scars.As for Andy, as a three-time Wimbledon champion myself, I offer him one bit of serious advice:I realise that your body is hurting and your spirits are desperately low. But please resist, if you possibly can, any thoughts to call it a day immediately.Instead, cut right back on your tournament schedule, look after that poor, pain-wracked body of yours, but don’t quit right away.As I did 20 years ago, it is vital that you play your last match at your spiritual home, Wimbledon, the scene of three of your greatest tournament triumphs.Your legions of fans need to say an emotional goodbye to you. And you, too, must bid farewell to the game you have loved on the square of grass that you have graced so wonderfully: Centre Court. If you don’t, you will regret it for the rest of your life.So what next?There will be a painful period of adjusting to not playing. Let your lovely wife Kim take care of you, while you also take care of her and your two daughters.After that, the media will be clamouring to employ you for decades to come, but, knowing you and the sort of man you are, I think you will want — and possibly need — a more serious job as well.He may be bowing out as a top player but, take it from me, the Andy Murray story is far from over. "},{"url":null,"title":"Boris Becker Sir Andys legions fans need carry on","story":"    Boris Becker (pictured above watching Andy Murray at 2016\u0027s Wimbledon)That’s why, for me, his greatest achievement was his 2016 end-of-season win over Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals which made Andy the world No 1.It was a very painful moment for me, because I was Novak’s coach.

There are 430,000 \u0027problem gamblers\u0027 in the UK, and around two million who are at risk of developing an addiction, the regulator says.Several banks, including Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and the Royal Bank of Scotland, allow customers to block themselves from gambling on debit and credit cards.Nevertheless, betting firms have indicated that ten to 20 per cent of the £43billion they receive each year in bets is placed using credit cards.The Labour Party announced last year that it would ban the use of credit cards to place bets to tackle what it called the \u0027epidemic\u0027 of addiction.Campaigners on the issue said a ban is long overdue.

(AP PhotoJacquelyn Martin)About 800,000 workers missed paychecks Friday, many receiving blank pay statements. Some posted photos of their empty earnings statements on social media as a rallying cry to end the shutdown, a jarring image that many in the White House feared could turn more voters against the president as he holds out for billions in new wall funding.With polls showing Trump getting most of the blame for the shutdown, the administration accelerated planning for a possible emergency declaration to try to get around Congress and fund the wall from existing sources of federal revenue. The White House explored erting money for wall construction from a range of other accounts. One idea being considered was erting some of the $13.9 billion allocated to the Army Corps of Engineers after last year\u0027s deadly hurricanes and floods.That option triggered an outcry from officials in Puerto Rico and some states recovering from natural disasters, and appeared to lose steam on Friday.California Gov. Gavin Newsom called it an \u0027unconscionable\u0027 idea to look at using disaster assistance \u0027to pay for an immoral wall that America doesn\u0027t need or want.\u0027Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas told reporters after discussions with the White House: \u0027I feel confident disaster relief dollars will not be tapped.\u0027 Brady said the administration was looking at the \u0027breadth\u0027 of unspent dollars in other government accounts.Other possibilities included tapping asset forfeiture funds, including money seized by the Department of Justice from drug kingpins, according to a congressional Republican not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. The White House also was eyeing military construction funds, another politically difficult choice because the money would be erted from a backlog of hundreds of projects at bases around the nation.Despite Trump\u0027s go-slow message, momentum grew in some corners for some sort of emergency declaration. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who met with the president on Friday, took to Twitter afterward to urge: \u0027Mr. President, Declare a national emergency NOW. Build a wall NOW.\u0027Trump has been counseled by outside advisers to move toward a national emergency declaration, but many in the White House are trying to pump the brakes. Senior aide Jared Kushner, who traveled with the president to the Texas border on Thursday, was among those opposed to the declaration, arguing to the president that pursuing a broader immigration deal was a better option. A person familiar with White House thinking said that in meetings this week, the message was that the administration is in no rush and wants to consider various options. The person was unauthorized to discuss private sessions and spoke on condition of anonymity.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has signaled moral opposition to the wall and vowed to oppose any funding, said the president is seeking to ert attention from special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s investigation and other White House problems.Nancy Pelosi talks to reporters after signing a House-passed a bill requiring that all government workers receive retroactive pay after the partial shutdown ends\u0027This isn\u0027t a wall between Mexico and the United States. This is a wall between his failures of his administration,\u0027 Pelosi told reporters. \u0027This is a big ersion, and he\u0027s a master of ersion.\u0027Although Trump has been frustrated with aides as he loses the public relations battle over the shutdown, White House attempts to use the trappings of the presidency to buttress his case for the wall have yielded mixed results in the president\u0027s view.Trump has long avoided using the Oval Office as a backdrop for his speeches, telling aides that previous presidents looked stilted and \u0027flat\u0027 in the standard, straight-ahead camera angle. But he was persuaded that the seriousness of the moment warranted the Oval Office for his speech to the nation this week about the fight over the border wall.But since Tuesday night\u0027s address, Trump has complained that he looked lifeless and boring, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. The president also expressed misgivings about his visit to the border, believing it would do little to change anyone\u0027s mind.In a Friday morning tweet, Trump called illegal immigration on the southern border \u0027an invasion,\u0027 even though border crossings have declined in recent years. Later, he tried to blame Democrats for the shutdown, claiming he\u0027s flexible about the needed barrier.\u0027I don\u0027t care what they name it,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027They can name it \u0027peaches.\u0027\u0027Trump has told advisers he believes the fight for the wall - even if it never yields the requested funding - is a political win for him.But some of his outside advisers have urged him to declare a national emergency, believing it would have two benefits: First, it would allow him to claim that he was the one to act to reopen the government. Second, inevitable legal challenges would send the matter to court, allowing Trump to continue the fight for the wall - and continue to excite his supporters - while not actually closing the government or immediately requiring him to start construction.Such a move could put Republicans in a bind. While it might end the standoff over funding and allow Congress to move onto other priorities, some Republicans believe such a declaration would usurp congressional power and could lead future Democratic presidents to make similar moves to advance liberal priorities.Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who speaks to Trump frequently, said that unless Republicans and Democrats strike an unlikely compromise, \u0027I fully expect him to declare a national emergency.\u0027\u0027Most conservatives want it to be the last resort he would use,\u0027 Meadows said. \u0027But those same conservatives, I\u0027m sure if it\u0027s deployed, would embrace him as having done all he could do to negotiate with Democrats.\u0027Many Democrats, meanwhile, say they have little reason to give into Trump\u0027s demand for border wall funding since taking control of the House in the midterm elections.\u0027The American people gave us the majority based on our comprehensive approach to this problem and they rejected President Trump\u0027s,\u0027 said Rep.

Now these new powers will make that apply to everyone.\u0027People will now have a \u0027duty of care\u0027 to ensure that waste is disposed of properly and within the law.\u0027Like businesses, if their waste ends up being fly-tipped, then they will need to prove to us that they used authorised waste contractors.          Councils have been issued guidance from the government on how to use their new powers proportionately, which makes clear penalties should not be used as a means of raising money and should not be issued for minor breaches\u0027If they are unable to do this to our satisfaction, then they will receive a fixed penalty, or prosecution for not exercising this duty of care.\u0027We will soon be making sure that everyone is aware of these new responsibilities through a publicity campaign so residents will know how to avoid falling foul of the new law.\u0027Fly-tipping has been an increasing problem in Coventry - rising from 3,342 incidents in 201617 to 4,704 in 201718 at the last count in November.The cost of clearing up the mess is no longer recorded, but in 201617 it is estimated that litter louts cost Coventry council more than £119,646.Councils have been issued guidance from the government on how to use their new powers proportionately, which makes clear penalties should not be used as a means of raising money and should not be issued for minor breaches.This guidance also says that local authorities should consider whether the householder is a vulnerable person, for instance due to age related ill-health or a mental or physical disability."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/17/4C03926D00000578-0-image-m-11_1525883193955.jpg","title":"Pictured mother missed 3m Hampshire home raffle","story":"    Mother-of-two Carina Alcock thought she\u0027d won a dream £3million riverfront home in the raffle - but was told she\u0027d get a fraction of the home\u0027s price in cash instead because too few tickets were sold  Mark and Sharon Beresford (in front of the property) failed to sell enough £25 tickets to make the house giveaway viable but still raised £750,000 - and pocketed up to £640,000          The house in Ringwood, Hampshire, is a Huf Haus, meaning it is a distinctive glass and wood property built by the German company of the same name, which can be constructed within days.

Overall the public is still against her deal by 41 points to 34, although the gap has more than halved.

Mr Grayling is one of Mrs May\u0027s (pictured) closest Cabinet allies. He has warned that He said they will rue the day if they join forces with pro-Remain Conservatives and kill off the Prime Minister\u0027s deal in Tuesday\u0027s crunch Commons vote. He told the Mail: \u0027People have to think long and hard about how they are going to vote. This is too important for political game-playing and I urge Conservative MPs who back Brexit and others to back the deal.\u0027If not, we risk a break with the British tradition of moderate, mainstream politics that goes back to the Restoration in 1660.\u0027MPs need to remember that Britain, its people and its traditions are the mother of Parliaments. We ignore that and the will of the people at our peril.\u0027Nearly 200,000 people died in the English Civil War, which resulted in a short-lived republic followed by the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Mr Grayling\u0027s remarks came amid reports that Mrs May could lose next week\u0027s vote by up to 200 votes.But the Transport Secretary, who has known the Prime Minister for more than 20 years and led her successful Tory leadership campaign in 2016, praised her \u0027Churchillian\u0027 resilience.He said: \u0027Many people in history eventually succeeded just by keeping going, not giving up. \u0027Keep buggering on,\u0027 as Churchill said. The public can see she is determined and passionate and doing her best for the country.\u0027      The number of Conservative supporters who want MPs (Theresa May is pictured) to back her deal has risen to 55 per cent – up eight points in five weeksBut the Survation poll is further evidence of the huge task Mrs May faces in rescuing her deal, which seems set for defeat in the Commons on Tuesday. Overall, it is still opposed by 41 per cent to 34 per cent of the public, although opposition has fallen by nine points since December.Worryingly for Mrs May, Labour has also taken a three-point lead over the Tories with the Conservatives on 38 to Labour\u0027s 41.But the poll – which questioned 1,013 adults on Thursday and yesterday – shows that despite lacking enthusiasm for the Prime Minister\u0027s deal, voters appear to prefer it to the prospect of leaving the EU with no deal at all. Given a straight choice between Mrs May\u0027s offer or \u0027no deal\u0027, 41 per cent support her deal, compared to 32 per cent who back \u0027no deal\u0027. Tory voters\u0027 support for the Prime Minister contrasts with other recent surveys, which have shown Conservative Party members oppose her deal.          The Survation poll is further evidence of the huge task Mrs May faces in rescuing her dealEven if her deal is thrown out by MPs next week, voters want her to produce an alternative \u0027Plan B\u0027 instead of leaving the EU without any agreement with Brussels, the poll found. A total of 44 per cent favour a \u0027Plan B\u0027 – seen by most as likely to offer a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit – with 32 per cent in favour of \u0027no deal\u0027.Mrs May was furious when rebel Conservative MPs defeated her in the Commons this week, joining forces with Labour to force her to produce a \u0027Plan B\u0027 in just three days if she loses on Tuesday. But the public backs the rebellion by 42 per cent to 35 per cent – and they also support Speaker John Bercow\u0027s decision to allow it.The survey offers other crumbs of comfort for Mrs May. Asked who they trust to handle Brexit, 34 per cent chose the Prime Minister, with 21 per cent for Mr Corbyn.She defeats Boris Johnson on the question of who is \u0027best to handle Brexit\u0027 by a margin of 34 per cent to 20 per cent. In another blow to Brexit hardliners like Mr Johnson who advocate \u0027no deal\u0027, when voters were asked to choose between that and staying in the EU, \u0027Remain\u0027 won by 46 to 41 per cent.The survey also provides fresh evidence of the deeply-conflicted views that Brexit has provoked in the public. A total of 45 per cent say Mrs May should resign if she is defeated, with 39 per cent in favour of her staying on.But Tory voters have not given up on her. An overwhelming 66 per cent say she should carry on in No 10 if she loses on Tuesday, with only 26 per cent in favour of her stepping down.A total of 26 per cent of the public say she is \u0027bad\u0027 for EU negotiations, with just 21 per cent stating she is \u0027good\u0027. But far more, 37 per cent, say whether she stays or goes will make little difference to Brexit.                                                      Brexit \u0027may not even happen\u0027: Biggest Leave donors give up on Brexit ever happening as Jeremy Hunt fears \u0027paralysis\u0027 if deal is rejected Two of the biggest donors to the Leave campaign say they have given up on Brexit ever happening.Billionaire Peter Hargreaves and veteran hedge fund manager Crispin Odey do not believe Britain will end up leaving the European Union amid the deadlock in Parliament.It came as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned yesterday that it is more likely than ever that MPs will work to block the UK leaving without a deal.Billionaire Peter Hargreaves and veteran hedge fund manager Crispin Odey do not believe Britain will end up leaving the European Union amid the deadlock in Parliament          Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned yesterday that it is more likely than ever that MPs will work to block the UK leaving without a deal    Amber Rudd (pictured) yesterday declined three times to say she would stay in the Cabinet if Theresa May opts for a no-deal BrexitMiss Rudd said it was \u0027right\u0027 for the Government to make preparations for no-deal, but did not think the outcome \u0027would be good for this country\u0027. Pressed for a third time by interviewer Justin Webb on whether she would quit if Mrs May went for the no-deal option, Miss Rudd cut him short, saying: \u0027Thank you very much, Justin.\u0027 But asked again later whether she would resign, following a speech on welfare in south London, she said: \u0027I am committed to making sure that we get the Withdrawal Agreement through next week.\u0027I have been in and out of Cabinet and I find you have more influence in Cabinet.\u0027Meanwhile it emerged that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has received more than £23,000 from Tory election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, in a sign that he may be considering a potential leadership bid.

The kapo looked Fritz in the eye. ‘If you want to go on living, you have to forget your father.’‘That’s impossible,’ he replied. After a few days of agonising, he returned to the kapo with an extraordinary request: ‘I need you to pull whatever strings you can to get me on the Auschwitz transfer.’The kapo was aghast. ‘What you’re asking is suicide.’ But Fritz was adamant. ‘I want to be with my papa, no matter what happens.

That makes them unique.More than luck or circumstance, it was their love and devotion to each other that kept them alive. ‘The boy is my greatest joy,’ Gustav wrote in his secret diary. ‘We strengthen each other. We are one, inseparable.’The doctor double act who can help you live healthier for...Trial for HIV prevention drug PrEP could DOUBLE after...Share this articleTogether, they endured a six-year odyssey through the hell of the camps, beginning with three years at Buchenwald, where Gustav so nearly became one of the tens of thousands to die in its unimaginably harsh conditions. Yet, however remarkable their story would prove to be, before the Nazis tore them apart there was nothing unusual about Gustav’s family.A decorated hero of the Great War, Gustav had married his sweetheart Tini and they were raising their four children – Fritz, Edith, Herta and Kurt – in a small apartment in Vienna, where he worked as a master upholsterer. Everything changed in March 1938, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. Under the Nuremberg Laws, Austrian Jews were stripped of their citizenship. In April that year, Fritz, then 14 and training to enter his father’s trade, was expelled from the Trade School. Gustav’s workshop was seized. Those caught buying from Jews were made to stand with a sign: ‘I am an Aryan, but a swine – I bought this in a Jewish shop.’A month later, the family dressed in their best outfits for a photograph. The photographer caught Gustav’s apprehensiveness and the stoicism of Tini’s dark eyes. It had been Tini’s urging that had brought them to the studio. She had a foreboding that the family might not be together for much longer and wanted to capture her children’s image while she had the chance.The hammer blow came on a Sunday in September 1939, when Tini was in the apartment with Herta, Fritz and Kurt. Four men arrived, all neighbours. All were working men like Gustav – friends with wives she knew, whose children had once played with hers.‘We want your husband,’ one said. ‘We have orders. If he isn’t here, we’re to take the lad.’ He nodded at Fritz. Tini felt as if she’d been physically beaten. They took hold of her precious boy and marched him out.When Gustav returned and heard what had happened, he turned around and headed for the door, intending to go straight to the police. Tini grabbed his arm. ‘Don’t,’ she said. ‘They’ll take you.’‘I’m not leaving Fritzl in their hands,’ he replied.‘No!’ Tini pleaded. ‘You have to run away, go somewhere and hide.’But there was no dissuading him. Leaving Tini in tears, Gustav walked quickly to the police station and announced: ‘I’m Gustav Kleinmann. I’m here to turn myself in. You have my son. Take me and let him go.’ The policeman glanced around. ‘Get the hell out of here,’ he muttered.Bewildered, Gustav left the building. He went home to find Tini distraught that Fritz was still gone. ‘I’ll try again tomorrow,’ Gustav said. But at 2am, a tide of men surged into the apartment. There was weeping, there were pleas, and final desperate words between husband and wife. And then it was all over. The door slammed, and Gustav was gone.Each morning, an hour and a half before dawn, shrill whistles yanked the prisoners from their sleep. Then came the kapos, yelling at them to hurry.Outside, Buchenwald was ablaze with electric light along the fence lines, atop the guard towers and in the walkways. People were herded to the square for roll call, standing motionless and shivering in their pitiful clothes for two hours. When it was time to go to work, sunrise was beginning to lighten the landscape.Gustav and Fritz had been assigned to the quarry detail, working as wagon haulers. All day, they and 14 other men had to heave and push a laden wagon weighing around four and a half tons up the hill, a distance of more than 800 yards, lashed and yelled at by kapos. Falls were frequent, with fractured limbs and broken heads. The injured would be taken to the infirmary or, if they were Jews, to the Death Block – a holding barrack for the terminally sick.Gustav and Fritz toiled on day after day, miraculously managing to avoid both punishment and injury. ‘We are proving ourselves,’ Gustav wrote in his diary.But things turned very different one day in November, after a failed assassination attempt on Hitler in Munich. When the prisoners lined up in the square, the kapos went along the ranks, grabbing every 20th man and shoving him forward. One of them was Fritz.A heavy wooden table with straps dangling from it was dragged on to the square. The Bock – the whipping bench. Fritz’s jacket and shirt were removed and his trousers pulled down. Gustav watched helplessly as the first lash landed like a razor cut across Fritz’s buttocks.‘Count!’ they yelled at their victim. ‘One,’ Fritz said. The bull-whip cut across his flesh again. ‘Two,’ he gasped. Fritz struggled to concentrate, knowing that if he lost count the lashes would start over again.At last the count reached 25 the strap was loosened and he was forced to his feet. Before his father’s eyes he was helped away, bleeding, his body on fire with pain, his mind stunned as the next unfortunate was dragged to the Bock.Despite his agony, Fritz was more worried about his papa than about himself. Dysentery and fever plagued the camp, and now the older man had caught the sickness.During roll call he swayed, shivering, his senses failing. He was unconscious before he hit the ground. When he woke, he was on his back. In his hazy, febrile state, Gustav dimly realised that he must be in the block set aside for hopeless cases, from which people rarely emerged alive. The Death Block. The air was thick, stifling, filled with groans and an atmosphere of hopelessness.As the days wore on, Fritz visited his papa whenever he could. The dysentery had failed to kill him, and the worst had passed.However, it was obvious to Gustav that he would never get well in this environment. After two weeks, Gustav begged to be discharged, but doctors wouldn’t let him go. He was far too weak to survive. Gustav was determined and asked Fritz to help him to his feet. With Fritz guiding his papa’s faltering steps, father and son slipped out of the Death Block together.It was October 1942 when they arrived at the most notorious of all the camps. Fritz had been allowed to go with his father and on their journey to Auschwitz, Gustav wrote: ‘Everyone is saying it is a journey to death, but Fritzl and I do not let our heads hang down. I tell myself that a man can only die once.’Fritz saw the marks of abuse and the signs of impending death in all his fellow prisoners, including himself: bruises, broken bones, sores, scabs and gapped teeth.The prisoners were able to shower once a week, but it was an ordeal. After showering, only the first men out got dry towels, so if you lagged behind you got nothing but a soaking rag and had to walk back to the barrack dripping, even in the coldest winter weather. Pneumonia was endemic, and often fatal. Food was distributed in the barrack. Only a few bowls were provided, so the first to get their helping of soup had to wolf it down so as not to keep the others waiting. If you managed to acquire your own spoon, you would guard it with your life.Having a decent pair of shoes was essential. If they were too large or too small, they chafed and caused blisters. Socks were rare, and many substituted strips of fabric torn from the tails of their camp-issue shirts. This in itself was risky, because damaging SS property was classed as sabotage.Gustav and Fritz were sent to a sub-camp within Auschwitz called Monowitz. Within weeks, most of their Buchenwald comrades had been sent to their deaths, but – against the odds – the pair had managed to survive as a result of their useful labouring skills. Fritz had been building the new camp, while his father had worked as a carpenter and upholsterer.Despite the overwhelming danger, Fritz became involved in a covert resistance against the SS, passing information to other prisoners about progress of the war, details he’d picked up from the civilians he worked with.One day he was seized, driven from the camp and accused by the head of the Auschwitz Gestapo of planning a large-scale escape, which he knew nothing about.He was lashed again, this time 60 times. Still he refused to name friends involved in the resistance.          Fritz, 17, at Buchenwald in 1940Fritz was allowed to return to camp, but fearing the Gestapo would return to look for him, his comrades came up with a daring plan: they hid him in an isolation room in the hospital, and recorded his death with the authorities. Weeks passed as Fritz recovered, now with a new identity – taken from a deceased typhus patient –and a new job as a warehouseman. So horrific was the death rate at Auschwitz that few prisoners were easily recognisable.Yet not knowing the truth, his father’s agony continued.One evening a friend came to see Gustav. ‘Follow me,’ he indicated, and led the older man down away from the road and towards the bathing block.In the low light inside, he saw the outline of a man standing back in the shadows. The figure came forward, his features resolving into the face of Fritz. It was miraculous. For Gustav, to hold his son in his arms again, to inhale the smell of him, to hear his voice, was beyond hope, beyond everything.Together they remained until January 1945, when Auschwitz was evacuated as Russian troops neared. They and thousands of other prisoners were forced to trudge through the snow, away from the advancing Red Army.Then they were put on trains bound for camps deeper inside the Reich. Their destination was Mauthausen in Austria, but father and son had decided to seize the chance to make their escape.When it came to it, Gustav, 53 years old and exhausted, didn’t have the strength to attempt it. Yet he couldn’t deny his son the chance to live. It would be a wrenching pain to part, but he urged Fritz to go alone.Fritz embraced his papa, and with his help climbed the slippery side wall of the wagon. He peered anxiously towards the brake houses on the adjacent wagons, occupied by armed SS guards. The train was thundering along at its maximum speed. Screwing up his courage, Fritz launched himself into the night and the rushing, freezing air.          Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland was infamous for the horror what went on insideFritz’s brave escape would not succeed, however. Despite his father’s fervent prayers, he was recaptured and imprisoned in Mauthausen – although the train itself was then erted and took Gustav to a different camp, Mittelbau-Dora. Father and son spent three months praying the other had been able to cling to life.And their prayers were answered. Mittelbau-Dora was liberated by US troops in April Mauthausen in May. When Fritz was first checked into an evacuation hospital, his weight was recorded as 5st 7lb, but he gradually regained strength. He returned home to Vienna, but found himself alone: his mother and sister Herta had been murdered by the Nazis, while Kurt had found sanctuary in America and Edith in England. He had no idea if his father was alive.It was September by the time Gustav, too, finally made his way home and went to the apartment building where his workshop used to be. There he found the one person he most longed to see: his beloved boy.They wept tears of joy. They were home and together again.© Jeremy Dronfield, 2019Extracted from The Boy Who Followed His Father Into Auschwitz, by Jeremy Dronfield, which is published by Michael Joseph on January 24, priced £12.99.

For about £99, testing kits which promise 100 per cent accurate next-day results can be bought online.Instead of requiring the physical presence at a clinic of both parties being tested, they involve only swabs taken from the inside cheeks of father and child, which are then packaged up and posted to the company.As long as the man is named on the child’s birth certificate, or has parental responsibility, no permission is required from either the mother or child, meaning the tests can be carried out in total secrecy.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027I don\u0027t know who my real dad is and I don\u0027t...\u0027Boys, let\u0027s have a cry and hug and get back to where we...Share this articleSome websites suggest DNA can be taken from children while they are asleep, to avoid awkward questions, particularly if the children are older.In some US states, concern over this has led to a recent ban on DIY home DNA testing, with all tests now having to be ordered by a doctor or court official and conducted under their supervision. In Britain, there is no such legislation currently being considered.Experts warn that the shock of learning a child is not biologically theirs can lead to severe emotional distress for some men, for which they may not be prepared. Laura House, a genetic genealogist, said that the boom in simple and quick DNA testing has overwhelmed the small number of trained genetic counsellors in the UK.‘There is a profound shortage of trained counsellors who can help people deal with what can be a devastatingly shocking discovery,’ she said. ‘People now get life-changing results via email while sitting alone on their sofa and they are often totally unprepared to navigate the fallout.’Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed the case of Moneysupermarket.com co-founder Richard Mason, who discovered the three sons he had raised as his own with his ex-wife Kate were not biologically his.          Richard Mason (left) with partner Emma (right) has revealed he discovered the three sons he had raised for more than 20 years were not his when doctors told him he had been infertile since birthMr Mason’s devastating realisation was the result of his being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which led doctors to inform him he had been infertile since birth.After the diagnosis, he confronted his ex-wife and uncovered the truth that his sons had been conceived by another man with whom she had conducted a four-year affair.The rising numbers of men turning to paternity testing suggests there are many who feel they may have been duped by women.Mr Thomas said: ‘Sometimes men will be delighted to learn they aren’t the father – usually when a woman with whom they have been having a casual relationship tells him he has fathered a baby and he can prove otherwise. In other cases it’s the mother who’s ordered the test to “shut the father up”.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Hi di hi di Theresa Sitcom star Su Pollard causes havoc Number 10 berates PM","story":"    Su Pollard (centre left), who shot to fame as holiday camp cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw in the BBC series Hi-de-Hi! was a guest of maverick Essex MP Andrew Rosindell (centre right)The actress and singer shouted back: ‘Hi-di-hi, Theresa!’Then the star, famous for her eccentric outfits and hairdos, proceeded to smack a kiss firmly on the cheek of Mrs May’s husband Philip, before grilling the pair on why Britain’s exit from the European Union was taking so long.One MP present told this newspaper: ‘It was very surreal.

In the news, Brexit provides an hourly reminder that merely wishing to bring about a glorious fresh start is no guarantee that calamity won’t be the result. Meanwhile, other dark developments – from the erosion of American democracy and the resurgence of the European far right, all the way to climate change – fuel a sense of foreboding that isn’t exactly motivational when it comes to self-improvement: the creeping fear that you might be living in the end times is a poor basis for making a new beginning. In any case, the never-ending debate on nature versus nurture seems to be drifting toward a gloomy acceptance that there’s much about ourselves we’ll never change. “DNA isn’t all that matters,” writes the geneticist Robert Plomin, whose book Blueprint epitomised this mood last year, “but it matters more than everything else put together in terms of the stable psychological traits that make us who we are.”Then again, the self-reinvention narrative was always a bit suspect to begin with. For one thing, it’s by no means clear that it’s possible to transform yourself through the simple application of inidual willpower: wherever you come down on nature and nurture, it’s undeniable that we owe much of our success or failure in life to our circumstances, and to luck. Then there is the infuriating psychological quirk of “hedonic adaptation”, otherwise known as the happiness treadmill. Succeed in improving your life, and the improvement will soon become part of the backdrop of your days, and thus cease delivering pleasure to recover that sense of vitality and zest, you’ll have to reinvent yourself again, ad infinitum.Finally, there’s the conundrum that the self being reinvented is the same one that’s doing the reinventing – so your existing flaws invariably get baked into your vision of the future. If you yearn to become, say, more productive or empathetic or physically fit in 2019, how do you know that very yearning isn’t just another expression of your tendency to beat yourself up, which you’d be better off addressing than indulging? Or suppose you plan to conquer your perfectionism: how will you avoid getting all perfectionistic about that? There are no completely fresh starts, there is no year zero. You’re already hopelessly ensnared in the only life you’ll ever get.In response to the prevailing mood, there has been a noticeable change of tone in the world of self-help, a publishing genre historically dedicated to promising massive, near-effortless transformation overnight, or in a couple of weeks at most. For a while now, that hyperbole has been losing ground to a spirit of anti-utopianism – of accepting yourself as you are, building a good-enough life, or just protecting yourself from the worst of the world outside. Adult colouring books are the most easily mockable manifestation of this urge. But it’s detectible, too, in the unceasing stream of Scandinavian lifestyle concepts – hygge, lagom, and the rest – with their focus on hunkering down and getting cosy and in the ongoing rediscovery of Stoic philosophy and the championing of “resilience” as techniques for enduring life’s blows.And it’s everywhere present, this time around, in the phase of the publishing calendar irritatingly known as “New Year, New You”. One thought-provoking example is a new edition of Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdat, formerly a senior executive with Google X, the search giant’s secretive research and development arm. Generally speaking, the notion that “happiness is an engineering problem” is one to distrust. But Gawdat, far from championing the tech multimillionaire lifestyle as the only one worth aiming for, writes movingly of having achieved it, only to discover its emptiness. And he has endured far worse, losing his 21-year-old son Ali as a result of complications during routine surgery.At the core of Gawdat’s “formula for happiness” is the venerable observation that happiness equals reality minus expectations: in order to feel distress because your life is lacking something, you must first have had some expectation of attaining that thing. (My life lacks a 70ft yacht, but this causes me no suffering, because I never imagined I’d have one.) The argument is not, as progressive critics of self-help sometimes imagine, that disadvantaged people need only stop expecting anything better in order to be content. Some expectations – a reasonable standard of living, healthcare, fulfilling work, social connection – may be entirely rational. But seeing the truth of the formula acts as a kind of sieve, allowing you to separate the handful of things you genuinely want from life from those you’ve been socialised into believing you should want. The latter aren’t worth the pursuit – and if they are the reason you’re trying to invent a “new you”, you’re better off sticking with the old one.One of the most rigorous articulations of the new mood of acceptance is Happy Ever After: Escaping the Myth of the Perfect Life by Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science at the LSE and, the publicity material explains, “an internationally renowned expert in human behaviour and happiness”. His book is a persuasive demolition of many of our cultural stories about how we ought to live, including the idea that there’s anything particularly desirable about being a senior academic or a renowned expert. In fact, his data suggests, pursuing education beyond the age of 18 is unlikely to make much positive difference to the pleasure or sense of purpose you experience in life: on average, after secondary school, “happiness decreases as education increases”.As Dolan concedes, it can be notoriously hard to pin down the direction of causation in wellbeing research: it could be that gloomier people are more prone to doing university degrees, rather than that degrees make people gloomy. Yet either way, the belief that more education equals more fulfilment is a clear example of what he calls a “narrative trap” – a socially imposed message about the ideal life that doesn’t match real experience. This ideal often ends up doing more harm than good, either by propelling people into lives they don’t enjoy, or by wrongly convincing those who don’t make the grade that they are missing out on a more satisfying existence. Another trap is the belief that higher-status jobs reliably bring more satisfaction (in fact, florists are generally much happier than lawyers), or that a larger income necessarily buys more happiness (it does, but only up to about £50,000 a year beyond that, tasks related to earning more money squeeze out more enjoyable ones).These sorts of findings are increasingly well known, but where Dolan excels is in drawing attention to how stubbornly we resist their implications. If happiness and a sense of purpose are your goals in life, then a “good job” or education or salary that fails to deliver them isn’t really “good” in any meaningful sense of the word – which makes it a strange thing to strive for, or to encourage your children to strive for. Oh, and speaking of children, the evidence is that parenthood won’t make you happier, either. (It does boost people’s sense of purpose, although apparently not more than various other things.) Likewise the dedicated pursuit of physical fitness, which turns out to lead to less happiness than you’d think. And marriage: it’s true that married people tell researchers they are happier than when they were single, but only if their husband or wife is present in the room during the interview.What makes Happy Ever After somewhat radical, at least by the standards of popular psychology, is its recognition that these narrative traps aren’t simply inexplicable mistakes we happen to make, but the products of ideology. They may not serve us, but they certainly serve the system in which we find ourselves embedded. The pursuit of wealth or social mobility might not bring happiness, but it does fuel economic growth – while marriage, parenthood, fitness and the rest keep the whole operation running smoothly into the next generation. Dolan focuses on how uniquely detrimental such messages can be for children from working-class families. Stereotypes about appropriate accents and lifestyles may deter them from going to university at all those who make it into middle-class professions then face self-consciousness and insecurity about fitting in. Dolan, raised “lower working class” in east London, writes that he still struggles with the cultural codes of academia: “I weight train with bodybuilders. Seeing a blazer or a pair of loafers at a bodybuilding competition is as rare as rocking-horse shit.”The new crop of anti-perfectionist self-help books are an important counterweight to the conventional message of self-reinvention, which is that there’s no point at which it makes sense to be satisfied with your situation and finally relax, since you could always benefit from acquiring more money, status, education, and so on. What’s less clear is whether this humbler kind of advice is any easier to implement, on a practical level, than the old sort. Apart from anything else, our narratives about the perfect life aren’t just beliefs we can choose to jettison by a mere act of will, after reading about research that refutes them. They are deeply entrenched in the culture, reinforced by the media, inculcated in us as small children, not to mention in our genes. (There are some obvious evolutionary advantages to constantly craving more resources, and never feeling as if what you’ve got is sufficient.) Moreover, no research finding about the average happiness of the general population can decisively prove that a given lifestyle choice is the right or wrong one for you, with all your idiosyncrasies. One chapter in Happy Ever After gamely makes the case for polyamorous relationships as a path to increased happiness, but whatever your reaction to that prospect – thrilling erotic adventure, or indescribable hassle? – it’s not clear that you should try to override it based on the results of academic studies.There’s another, more mind-bending problem with using this kind of research to direct personal change, which is that many such transitions are what the philosopher LA Paul calls “transformative experiences”: they turn you into a person so different that you’re unable, from the vantage point of the present, to imagine what that future person will make of them. To pick the most obvious example, becoming a parent might transform you into the kind of person who adores having children, even if beforehand you weren’t. But it might just as easily work the other way, turning someone enthusiastic about the prospect into the kind who’d never have chosen to do so.Nonetheless, it’s psychologically freeing to be reminded that there is no single path to satisfaction – and that if circumstances or personal preferences disbar you from following the herd, you still have a good shot at fulfilment. “Quite a lot of what passes itself off as dialogue about our society,” the essayist Tim Kreider has written, “consists of people trying to justify their choices as the only right or natural ones by denouncing others’ as selfish or pathological or wrong. So it’s easy to overlook that hidden behind all this smug certainty is a poignant insecurity, and the naked 3am terror of regret.” Much of the time, when it comes to building a meaningful life, you’re flying blind. But the comforting truth is that so is everyone else.Then again, judging by its continued dominance of the self-help shelves, you’d be forgiven for concluding that the key to a perfect life was indisputable: lots and lots of Buddhist (or at least Buddhist-inspired) meditation. This is ironic, since Buddhism embodies one of the earliest confrontations with the truth about the perfectionist standards by which we judge the world and ourselves – that this is a recipe for permanent dissatisfaction. The basic situation, Buddha famously said, is that life is suffering. Everything is impermanent old age, sickness and death are our inescapable human fate. And your philosophy of happiness had better acknowledge these realities, otherwise the only possible result is even more suffering, for you and everyone around you.Haemin is especially eloquent on life’s smaller dissatisfactions, and how they can sometimes be trickier to deal with than the bigger, more dramatic ones. For example, though it’s a good thing that we talk so much more openly today about mental illness, one perverse consequence is that it can actually be easier to admit to a serious depression than to a milder, pervasive sense of disappointment in life. “Unlike other emotions, disappointment is very tricky to express: it comes out as petty and small-minded,” Haemin writes it also tends to sound like you’re blaming other people for failing to measure up. Yet of course it’s a far more widespread problem than severe suffering. It has been argued that Buddha’s observation that “life is suffering” might be more accurately translated as something like “life is bothersome”. (With luck, extreme agony will be very infrequent in your life, but a background sense of things being not quite right may be truly close to universal.) The first step towards relieving this kind of discontent, Haemin suggests, is to recognise the untenability of the demand that you, or anyone you encounter, should demonstrate perfection to begin with. Much of the bothersomeness of daily life arises not from circumstances themselves, but from the insistence that they ought to be other than they are.Having not yet attained Haemin’s tolerance for other people’s flaws, I can’t resist observing that his wisdom all too often comes across as platitudinous. The book’s prose passages are interspersed with sections laid out as blank verse, inadvertently demonstrating that mundane reflections aren’t transformed into profundities merely by centring them on the page and inserting a few line breaks. (A typical example: “If someone did not ask for your help,  do not try to solve her problem for her.  Though your intentions may be good,  You risk taking control away from her  and injuring her self-esteem.”) Still, he’s not wrong. And behind the sporadic banality lurks a bracingly hard-headed world view: reality is what it is, and a lot of unnecessary misery arises from demanding that things shouldn’t be the way that – as a matter of stubborn fact – they are. This is not a counsel of resignation having accepted the reality of your situation, it may well be appropriate to try to change it. But not denying how things stand is the essential first step. Or, as the psychotherapist Carl Rogers put it: “The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.”Ironically, if not very surprisingly, the wellbeing industry has proved adept at turning this new spirit of modesty and acceptance into another expensive consumerist pursuit. Those Scandinavian “secrets of happiness” are a case in point: “hygge” may evoke contended relaxation around a familiar fireplace with old friends, but that doesn’t mean you can’t spend almost £200 on a specially hygge-appropriate plant-dyed pillow, or £80 on a set of candle holders, at the website hyggelife. (And while “lagom” may mean “just the right amount” in Swedish, there are at least six recent books in English on the subject, which isn’t just the right amount, but too many.) Your effort to become the sort of person who finds happiness in what they already have can easily become its own interminable quest, in which success – and therefore happiness – always lies in some fantasy of the future, rather than in the here and now.As always, this is capitalism’s fault. But most of us are complicit: we chase unattainable fantasies of self‑reinvention, rather than confronting reality, at least in part because life is easier that way. This is one of the lessons of an absorbing recent addition to the anti-perfectionist self-help subgenre, The Courage to Be Disliked, by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, published in English last year. (By then, it had reportedly already sold more than 3.5m copies in the original Japanese and other translations.) Despite all the “new Japanese phenomenon” marketing – the book was described by one critic as “Marie Kondo, but for your brain” – it is primarily an accessible exploration of the work of the Austrian psychotherapist Alfred Adler. He held that we frequently cling to our problems, no matter how much we complain about them and claim we want to eradicate them, because overcoming them necessitates an encounter with fear. It can be easier to locate fulfilment – and fulfilment in intimate relationships above all – in the future, where we never quite have to do what it takes to attain it, rather than run the interpersonal risks involved in trying to achieve it now.The problem, as Kishimi and Koga make clear, is that this only makes for more suffering in the present, by systematically biasing you towards taking the kind of actions that postpone, rather than build, a meaningful life. In this way, fantasies of total self-transformation don’t simply fail, they also block change of the more modest – but real – kind. And in any case, the future never seems to arrive: the truth is that the present is the only time it’ll ever be possible to make a change. Transformative self-reinvention may be an overoptimistic dream, but defeatism about change is its own kind of false comfort, too: both are forms of absolutism that serve to justify passivity. We will fail to reinvent ourselves this January, or next month, or next January, or ever. But once we finally get that fact into our heads, we might at last be able to start making a few improvements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1510f53a838f62a6ab4a75647ab782bd26b859/0_510_7869_4721/master/7869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f30deba951ade077c73347a4c8dbb1","title":"paula saunders interview the distance home debut novel family history","story":"‘Everything was too painful for Leon he seemed too tender to be alive.” His sister René, however, is ambitious, resilient and destined to escape. Set in 1960s rural America, Paula Saunders’s debut novel, The Distance Home, shows how two siblings, both with a gift for dancing, are set on paths of self-destruction and success by their parents. In a moving postscript, Saunders explains that the novel is based on her own troubled family history growing up in South Dakota. Today she lives in California and is married to the Booker prize-winning novelist George Saunders.Why did you choose to write your story as a novel rather than as a straightforward memoir? I found that giving myself some distance from the characters – who are, of course, based on the people in my family – allowed me to create situations and circumstances for them and explore their lives in ways I could never have felt comfortable doing in a memoir. Plus, by shaping the character of René (whose experience mirrors my own) and seeing her as separate from myself, I felt less guarded and more able to look into her motivations and feelings with empathy instead of blame. I did initially write the novel in first person from René’s point of view, but changing to third person was a critical step in my ability to understand these characters.You write that you needed to be able to see your childhood from ‘a perspective less tainted by personal pain and judgment and blame’. How did it feel to revisit the past after all these years?First, it seems to me that the attempt to write honestly about people in your life who have been challenging for you forces you to try to understand what might have contributed to different aspects of their character, or what might have allowed for a certain situation to develop. The process automatically opens up some kind of deeper empathy for them as iniduals.Second, I think meditation practice helped me to calm down and stop blaming the people who appeared to be responsible for all the problems. It helped me to see that circumstances are not as solid as we might think, and that situations and relationships can be penetrated and changed through love and understanding.This is an incredibly assured first novel. What took you so long?I always thought I’d be able to be a wife, a mother, and write books. Sounds easy enough, right? When our children were small, we had no money and no family nearby. There was a lot of work to do and not much room to pursue artistic ambitions. Though I did endeavor to continue writing during those years – turning to poetry because I felt I could go in and out of it more easily than prose – it took everything I had to try to create a family that I actually wanted to be a part of. Also, because the novel was based on my own experiences growing up, there was a lot to process in finding a path between my anger and the love I felt for everyone involved.Were any writers or books particularly influential?I have always been fascinated by myths and fairytales, and I think The Distance Home has a strong element of both. The setup – a daughter idolised, a son reviled – seems reminiscent of a fairytale. Plus, reading Elena Ferrante was critical: her work seemed to grant me permission to write about my own dark and troubled family relationships, to see the exploration of our smaller, daily interactions and how they affect each of us, as valuable and worthwhile.As a family epic, the novel reminds me of both Anne Tyler and Jonathan Franzen. Were you conscious of writing in an American tradition?To me, this is a completely American story, especially because it’s a story of ision – of the haves and have-nots, the accepted and rejected. It seems that here, in America, we need to constantly identify an outsider, a threat. Where there isn’t a natural enemy – or an evident other – we tend to create one to fulfil some requirement of our psyche and complete our expectations of the world. So this book – the story of one child preferred and one rejected – seems to hold a mirror to that larger psychology and to locate the beginning of that repeated pattern of ision in the family. We might see in this book’s family, as in our own, the immensely destructive power of our western ideas of winning and losing, success and failure.There are several mentions of tensions and prejudices living alongside the Native American population. Was this something you were very conscious of as a child?Yes, there was an air of mild and continual racism in our house that I was always very aware of. Most of us now are attuned to the histories of oppressed peoples and the horrors we, as the dominant race, have inflicted and are inflicting on the disenfranchised. But when I was a child, there seemed to be the seeds of racist thought in the everyday language and attitudes, both at home and outside of it. My feeling is that the small, continual violences in our family and the lazy, casual racism pervading both our home and the culture at large emanated from the same source – from a need to identify an enemy, and a fear of losing whatever power and position one might have managed to secure.I was particularly affected by the spitefulness with which the other girls treat René at school, just for daring to be different and ambitious. I’m guessing this comes from first-hand experience?Yes. I think that when you grow up in a culture that values winning and success, your peers are not going to be so pleased to see you excel. Winning and losing is a zero-sum game. When someone starts to rise, it’s a rational act of self-preservation for others to try to bring her down, because we all know the cost of being at the bottom. So to secure our place, we have to do battle with each other. This seems to be a lesson we learn very early on.And, sorry, but I’ve got to ask: how does it feel to be publishing your debut as the wife of one of America’s most acclaimed writers?I’m so happy for George’s success. I was one of his first fans – before he’d published more than a story or two in little magazines – and I’ve always adored his work. So I’m pleased and proud to now have my book next to his on the shelf.George’s essay What Writers Really Do When They Write, about how he finally came to write Lincoln in the Bardo, has become a creed for aspiring writers. How would you describe your own writing process?My first principle is: sit down! Sit down, sit down, sit down! After that, I have to remember to be quiet and listen. And revising is my only way forward. Only by trying one more time, again and again, can I begin to approach a thought, idea, image or bit of language I might have in mind in some vague, preconceptual way. Thankfully, I love to revise, mainly because it’s such an open process, with no right or wrong, only the guiding instincts of my own taste and aesthetic inclinations. I’m a rewriter.Which books are on your bedside table?Jonathan Franzen’s The End of the End of the Earth – which I’m captivated by. George Eliot’s Middlemarch – which I’ve been meaning to reread for the longest time. Flannery O’Connor’s Complete Stories – because, just, aah. Our Pristine Mind by Orgyen Chowang – an inspiring book on meditation practice.Which books or authors do you always return to?Willa Cather, Jean Rhys, Tolstoy, Toni Morrison.Which book would you give to a young person?John Steinbeck’s The Red Pony along with The Pearl.Do you prefer to read on paper or a screen?I always read on paper. There’s something about the feel of a book that I just love.• The Distance Home by Paula Saunders is published by Random House (£14.99).

Humans have been looking up at the stars for thousands of years, but modern telescopes and computers are rapidly accelerating our understanding. We know far more than we did even 20 years ago, and we are now much closer to answering questions about whether life exists elsewhere in the cosmos, how our planet came to be here, our cosmic origins and eventual fate.On a clear night the stars twinkle in the sky, and often we can see the bright planets of our own solar system in orbit, like us, around our sun. Until the early 1990s, we had no idea whether there were any other planets around the stars in the sky. Astronomers suspected so, but had no way to prove it. We have in the past decade found thousands in orbit around foreign stars, and have a better idea of how common they are. A sizable fraction of stars probably have their own planets, their own worlds carried around them in the most fantastically erse solar systems.Look up at the stars, though, and you can’t see any of their planets. They are tiny and don’t make much light of their own. Even with powerful telescopes it is hard to see a planet directly, as the light from its parent star is blindingly bright in comparison. Instead, astronomers have devised ingenious methods to find them. One is the “wobbling” effect: a planet makes its parent star wobble just a little as it orbits around it, the star feeling a subtle pull of gravity from the smaller planet. In 1995 the Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz used the Haute-Provence Observatory telescope in France to pinpoint a star, 51 Pegasi b, that was wobbling just as expected. It revealed a planet, similar in size to Jupiter but so close to its star that it takes only four days to orbit around it, far quicker of course than Earth or any of the planets in our solar system.Astronomers have since found a huge haul of planets using Nasa’s Kepler satellite, which launched in 2009 and ended its spectacularly successful mission late in 2018. Kepler was designed to spot planets crossing in front of their parent stars, looking for the slight dimming effect of the planet blocking some of the starlight. Kepler has found thousands of planets this way, including many whose complete orbit around their star takes just hours or days. Some are so close to their star that their surface must be entirely molten lava. It has shown us solar systems with multiple planets, and some planets that orbit around two stars – “Tatooine” planets, named after Luke Skywalker’s fictional home. Some planets are larger than Jupiter, some are as small as our moon. Most were found by professional astronomers, but amateurs have found them too, using pattern recognition to mine online data from the Kepler mission and catch planets that automated searches had missed. We now think there are more planets than stars in the sky.We want to find out how likely it is that a habitable planet like Earth exists and, even better, to find one. In the elusive “Goldilocks” zone, the conditions must be just right: not too hot and not too cold. Astronomers have already found a few dozen planets like this, of which at least three are in the Trappist I solar system, found in 2015 around one of our nearest stars. Trappist I has seven planets, all similar in size to Earth, and at least one has a liquid water ocean. Studying these planets, and some of the hundreds of millions of potentially habitable planets in our Milky Way galaxy is the goal of ambitious new projects. Nasa’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), launched in 2018, is expected to find more than 20,000 new planets. The most interesting will be examined in greater detail by the James Webb Space telescope, the Hubble space telescope’s successor, due to fly in the 2020s.The stars in the sky are hosts to this wealth of solar systems, but they also have a vital role to play as nature’s great factories. Consider gold: where did it come from? Astronomers have long wondered how gold came to be part of Earth’s ingredients. We know that it is stars themselves that manufacture what our own bodies are made of, including mostly carbon and oxygen. The British-American astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first worked out in the 1920s that stars are themselves mostly just hydrogen and helium gas. The intense heat at the heart of stars can fuse together these tiny atoms into slightly larger ones, which are then ejected into space when the stars explode at the end of their lives. Those recycled remnants will later be present at the birth of new stars like our sun, and will end up making new planets like our own. But the alchemy of making gold has long been a mystery. Gold has much larger atoms than carbon and oxygen, and can’t be made in the core of a star. The explosions of inidual stars could create some of it, but not enough.In 2017 astronomers concluded that another way gold is generated is during intense collisions of pairs of neutron stars. Neutron stars are nature’s weirdest. They are incredibly dense, the result of squashing a star larger than our sun into a space just a few miles across, after it has run out of the fuel that kept it burning bright. A spoonful of neutron star weighs as much as a mountain. We can’t see them with regular telescopes, but they send out radio waves. The stars spin around and, if oriented right, their beam of radio waves sweeps past Earth regularly, like a lighthouse beacon. The astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell first discovered one of these stars in November 1967 using a radio telescope she built (with Anthony Hewish) as a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. The pulses of radio waves she saw from the star were so regular, arriving every second, that they initially named it LGM-1 for “Little Green Men”, half-jokingly considering that it might be a signal from aliens.When a pair of these neutron stars orbit around each other, their pull of gravity is so strong that they actually deform the fabric of space-time itself. A gravitational wave ripples outwards, subtly shrinking and then expanding space and everything in it, over and over, as it passes on by. On 17 August 2017 the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave observatory in the US (Ligo), and the Virgo detector in Italy felt a burst of these waves passing through Earth. Using lasers to measure the precise length of two 4km-long tubes positioned at right angles, they directly measured the tiny squeezing and stretching of the tubes. They were sensing two neutron stars for the first time, catching the last two minutes of their life as they spun thousands of times around each other before colliding.The Ligo and Virgo teams immediately alerted astronomers around the world, so that they could search for the aftermath. It was still daytime in Hawaii and Chile, home to many of the largest telescopes, so they had to wait until nightfall. Astronomer Ryan Foley and his team from the University of California in Santa Cruz were the first to locate a burst of intense light coming from the collision, using the Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. They in turn alerted the community so that other telescopes could swing to take a closer look. In the end it was seen by 70 observatories on all seven continents and from space. What they had found was a kilonova and by studying the explosion, astronomers could tell that it had produced huge amounts of gold and platinum, much more than the entire weight of Earth. That particular collision happened too far away to have produced the gold on your finger, but here at last was decisive proof that closer to home collisions like this could have created Earth’s gold.The stars, source of heat and light and of our very bodies, give an impression of permanence. There they are, night after night. We do, though, already know that they will change. Their positions in the sky will gradually shift, as our own solar system moves around the Milky Way galaxy, our larger home to billions of stars. And they will eventually stop burning bright, and new ones will be born. Within astronomy, my particular expertise is cosmology, in which I ask questions about the life story of the whole of the universe. As a professor at Princeton University I also teach undergraduate students, and I train junior scientists to ask, and answer, their own questions about the cosmos.By the late 20th century astronomers had begun to consider a big change on the horizon. If we look beyond our own Milky Way galaxy, we find a sea of galaxies, each a collection of billions of stars, strewn throughout space. A century ago, the astronomers Edwin Hubble and Georges Lemaître showed that the galaxies are, on average, all moving apart from each other. Space itself is growing. But the pull of gravity of all the galaxies towards each other should tend to slow down the growth of space, just as a ball thrown in the air comes to a halt and then falls back down again. So astronomers turned to wondering whether space would one day stop growing altogether, and then start to shrink. Billions of years in the future, might all the galaxies come crashing back towards each other, invading our local cocoon of stars and marking the end of the universe as we know it?The key to answering this lay in measuring how fast space is growing and comparing it to its growth in the past. You can of course see into the past by looking far out into space, at places from which light set off a long time ago. Using a set of telescopes in Chile, Hawaii and the Canary Islands, rival teams of astronomers made new measurements of distant galaxies, using extremely bright exploding stars as cosmic markers. The teams, led by Brian Schmidt at Mount Stromlo observatory in Australia, and Saul Perlmutter at the University of California in Berkeley, measured galaxies whose light set off as long as 7bn years ago. In 1998 both announced the same surprising discovery, which was that space was not slowing down at all. Instead, galaxies appeared to be moving apart from each other faster and faster. This was as peculiar as if you threw a ball in the air, and it sped up and away from your hand into the sky. By the early 2000s other measurements of the universe were telling the same story, and over the past decade the evidence has become incontrovertible. We still don’t yet know why this is happening. Astronomers refer to whatever is causing this as “dark energy”, a form of energy we have not yet identified. It could be the energy of empty space itself, or something entirely new. It is a mystery waiting to be solved.This new finding means that we no longer expect all the galaxies in space to come crashing back towards us. We are probably safe from that fate. But our own Milky Way is still on a collision course with at least one other galaxy. We are flying towards Andromeda, the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way, at a speed of more than 50 miles per second, and there is no turning back. A few billion years from now we will unavoidably collide and mix our stars together. Any living beings in our solar system by then will see a spectacular change in the night sky when it happens, but the gaps between stars is so large that it is unlikely any will physically collide. Our sun will simply find itself part of a larger home. This future view of our cosmos, our revolutionary discoveries of new worlds around stars, and our understanding of how the inner workings of stars make the fabric of our lives, are just some of this century’s exciting discoveries. A common thread is that major advances in astronomy take teams of scientists working together, using telescopes around the world and in space, coupled with powerful computers. The questions we are asking cannot, for the most part, be solved by people working alone. As a result, the community is international. Meet an astronomer anywhere in the world, and most likely they are asking the same questions about the existence of life elsewhere, our place in space and the cosmic story of how we came to be here. And with many magnificent new telescopes being readied for the coming decade, we can expect together to take further great strides in our understanding of the night skies, and the wider universe, in the coming 20 years. We know, based on past experience, that the most exciting discoveries will probably be the ones we have been least expecting.• Jo Dunkley’s Our Universe: An Astronomer’s Guide is published by Pelican on 31 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5038cff3d9ac76ae6954427eb614e476255d913b/0_119_3570_2142/master/3570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e44e520ce596ba42c57af76d0607b7d","title":"stephen king horror book review portland press herald","story":"Press Herald turns tweet aghast at plan to drop Maine content into chance to attract 100 digital subscriptionsA Maine newspaper that horrified the bestselling author Stephen King by dropping its local book review coverage used his complaint to boost digital subscriptions.King, who lives in Bangor, complained on Friday about the Portland Press Herald’s decision to stop publishing freelance reviews of books about Maine or written by Maine authors.

A growing chorus of global leaders spent 2018 warning that the leveraged loan mountain was getting dangerously large and inviting comparisons with the financial crisis a decade ago.The Bank of England, Australia’s central bank, the International Monetary Fund and members of the US Federal Reserve have raised red flags over so-called leveraged loans, which are offered to companies already in debt but often come with few strings attached.In October last year the Bank’s financial policy committee, which monitors the health of the financial system, pointedly raised the spectre of the 2007-08 credit crunch. It said the “global leveraged loan market was larger than – and was growing as quickly as – the US sub-prime mortgage market had been in 2006”.As with the sub-prime crisis, the bank added, underwriting standards had slipped – in other words, risky corporate debt was too easy to get right now. “Given the decline in underwriting standards, investors in leveraged loans are at increasing risk of loss,” said the Bank.The key question now is whether a bubble in a different corner of the debt market could trigger a market panic. “A quote wrongly attributed to Mark Twain fits here: history rarely repeats, but it does rhyme,” said Rasheed Saleuddin, a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Judge Business School.While he said it was hard to see the next financial crash coming directly from a failure in the leveraged loan market, Saleuddin added that there was a chance that “small changes in default rates in the loans or even in expectations of same could cause a meltdown”.In the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, banks were so keen to lend that they liberally handed out mortgages to customers with weak or no credit histories who ended up defaulting when times got tough. Those mortgages had been bundled together and turned into investable products, causing a chain reaction of losses that spread like wildfire throughout the financial system and caused a global downturn.A decade later, rather than doling out risky loans to homeowners, banks are handing out leveraged loans to indebted companies. Many are also “covenant-lite”, meaning they come with fewer strings attached for borrowers, and as a result, present greater risk for lenders.But since most loans are sold on and packaged as collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, there are fewer incentives to impose strict terms. Leveraged loans also come with floating rates, making them more attractive for investors, who receive higher interest payments when rates rise.Amir Amel-Zadeh, an associate professor at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, explained that investors in leveraged loans, loan mutual funds and CLOs could face higher losses than investors in the same products during the 2008 crisis due to lower lending standards, an increase in covenant-lite loans and higher levels of corporate indebtedness than 10 years ago.But while the trends in the CLO market were similar, he said the scale was nowhere near the mortgage securitisation market in 2008 – at about a tenth of the size. “So at first sight it is not as worrying from a systemic risk point of view. However, if economic conditions worsen, it can lead to losses for many investors and lead to a similar dry-up in liquidity in these instruments as we have witnessed with sub-prime mortgage securitisations during the 2008 crisis.”Reports have already emerged that the market for CLOs may be cooling, as uncertainty grips financial markets. With fewer investors lining up to take a slice of the leveraged loan market, prices have dropped, and banks have been postponing sales of leveraged loans to investors as a result. “If banks have to keep the loans on their books they will be exposed to the price risk,” Amel-Zadeh said.Without a hungry market to sell leveraged loans to, banks may be less willing to lend so liberally to indebted companies.

That flat part on top of the mirror? Perfect for postcards. Weird bit along the stairs that doesn’t seem to have any structural purpose? Exactly the right place for an exhibition of the exhibitions I’ve seen over the last couple of years, perked up with some holiday snaps and another plant. While it’s not quite at Channel 4 documentary intervention levels yet, I unashamedly love stuff.Two words, then, strike fear in my heart: “Marie” and “Kondo”. At this time of year, it’s very difficult to avoid any mention of the Japanese guru’s minimalist philosophies, but I have a pathological aversion to advice on cutting back on stuff. But now that she has her own show on Netflix, and my algorithm thinks I need to watch it, she has become impossible to avoid. Kondo is taking the tips she developed in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying and guiding real people through the process, in a series that comes off as a cross between Queer Eye, Supernanny and How Clean Is Your House?, which, come to think of it, explains why that algorithm is so insistent that it’s for me.So, persuaded by constant exposure, I gave in and watched Kondo do her thing. It is exactly the kind of television I enjoy: it’s a nose around other people’s lives, with an uplifting feelgood message to boot. But I am yet to be converted by the pull of less stuff (on a separate note, David Attenborough might have something to say about all those bin bags full of rubbish and plastic boxes for “organising”).While I understand that having three separate “crap drawers” in different rooms may not be bringing me joy, I blench at the idea of neat boxes and bare shelves. My grandparents had houses brimming with photographs and ornaments, essentially memories made physical. They were happy places to be, for many reasons, and their homes were so distinctively theirs, in part because of all the stuff they had.Having said that, I’m only a couple of episodes in and I am starting to wonder if a cupboard full of Nokia chargers has quite the same emotional pull. Perhaps Marie Kondo will bring me joy after all.Last week, an unexpected pocket of the internet came to her rescue by helping to debunk a fake nude picture that has been circulating online. The photograph, of a woman in a bath with a candle, vaping, was published on a rightwing news site, having been captioned as an Instagram post by the congresswoman from 2016. In fact, as reported by Motherboard, the picture had been discredited by a foot fetish website called wikiFeet, whose users cross-referenced existing pictures of Ocasio-Cortez’s feet and concluded that these were, in fact, not the same ones. “I’ve sucked enough toes in my life to recognise when something doesn’t look right,” one user told the reporter. Those who claim that civil discourse is disintegrating may be surprised to learn of Wikifeet’s contribution to righting these wrongs, but we live in confusing times.“Women in leadership face more scrutiny. Period,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez, condemning the news site that published the picture, while adding that tabloids had offered her boyfriend’s family money for stories about her. This is not scrutiny. This is a red flag, a warning, an attempt to dissuade others like her. “If they want to make an example out of me, I will gladly be one,” she later wrote. “Hopefully, we can be an example of dedication, courage and persistence under fire.”“With no response from me to the latest resurfacing of this article, it could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter which I want to make it clear I am not,” she explained.She added that she spoke about May only because she “greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM, who at that point I felt had abandoned us”. You just know that David Cameron has got a Kate Bush playlist that he wheels out for dinner parties. I know it’s adolescent to find it as satisfying as I do, but the idea that Bush might have just ruined the soundtrack to Cameron’s summer soirees is one I quite enjoy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7fb40b40e979c76475ea3fccd291db5cd6aa91e/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4634a19fb51d0b5c52b0cc7bad77985","title":"psychology masculinity men apa guidlines","story":"The APA’s sensible concern over the danger posed by traditional gender roles will save livesLast August the American Psychological Association (APA) released its first-ever guidelines for therapists working with men and boys. Nobody paid much attention to these for several months, but they went viral this week. This was largely due to the APA condensing its academic report into a tweet explaining that the key takeaway is that traditional masculinity is harmful and socializing boys to suppress their emotions causes damage. Suddenly everyone on the internet was an armchair psychologist and conservatives were up in arms about war on men.While all that sounds eminently sensible to me, certain intellectuals on the right have predictably interpreted it as meaning the APA has it out for men. The Fox News host Laura Ingraham, for example, made the compelling argument that toxic masculinity is actually great because she “loves James Bond”. (Please can someone explain to Ingraham that Bond is a fictional character?) Meanwhile Tucker Carlson, that bastion of reason, asked: “What would happen if you told girls the qualities that make you feel female are poison and you must suppress them?” I don’t think he quite understands that feminists have been fighting against poisonous gender stereotypes for a very long time. And, by the way, the APA has a set of guidelines for women.Despite the right using the APA guidelines as an opportunity for outrage, we should all be highly encouraged by the new guidelines. It’s a great sign that toxic gender norms are being gradually interrogated and dismantled and it will literally save lives.Twitter can be a hellhole, but it can also be a powerful force for good. This week it may well have saved the life of 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who fled her Saudi family and pleaded for help on Twitter from an airport hotel in Bangkok. When she first tweeted about being worried her family would kill her for renouncing Islam (which is punishable by death in Saudia Arabia), Rahaf only had a handful of followers. But, thanks to the Egyptian American feminist Mona Eltahawy translating her tweets from Arabic and sending them out to her large follower base, she quickly caught the world’s attention. On Friday, Rahaf was granted asylum in Canada. It is wonderful that Rahaf is now safe, but let us remember that many women in Saudi Arabia’s repressive regime are not. The kingdom has locked up a number of women’s rights activists, and there are worries they are being tortured. Let’s not stop paying attention to the plight of women in Saudi Arabia when Rahaf has faded from the headlines.Republicans aren’t the only ones having a meltdown over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Politico published an article on Friday titled Exasperated Democrats try to rein in Ocasio-Cortez, in which her various colleagues gripe about the politician daring to take on the establishment. Yet another example that there is nothing that scares people more than a strong young woman who knows her mind and won’t toe the line.Every month needs a neologism and a hashtag now, didn’t you know? If you missed the memo then Januhairy is a new campaign encouraging women to grow and love their body hair. Good for you if you’re not shaving for the month – but also good for you if you are. It’s important to challenge and interrogate sexist beauty ideals, of course. But I’m growing somewhat tired of these campaigns that would purport to turn hairy armpits into #empowering #emblems of hashtag feminism.Last year Spa!, a Japanese tabloid, published a ranking of universities, based on how willing its female students were to have sex at drinking parties. More than 38,000 people signed a petition condemning this gross list, and the magazine apologized on Tuesday.A woman in China can’t hear men’s voices due to a rare but temporary hearing condition.

Her first memoir, The Wrong Knickers (2014), was a bestseller. It was followed by the acclaimed Mad Girl (2016), about her battles with obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia and addiction. Her third book, Eat, Drink, Run, is about training for the London Marathon and setting up a mental health support group, Mental Health Mates. She lives in Clapham, London, with her husband and daughter.You interviewed Prince Harry about his struggles with mental health for the Mad World podcast in 2017, and in the new book you say that you got stopped on the street by people who had heard it and appreciated what he had said. Does this still happen?Yes, which makes me sound like I’m Madonna! It’s not like I can’t buy a pint of milk without being mobbed, but I get stopped a couple of times a day not just because of the Prince Harry interview, but by people who say that what I have written has resonated with them. When I look at my last book, Mad Girl, it doesn’t feel radical now, but when it came out two years ago people weren’t talking about mental health in that way.You founded Mental Health Mates in 2016 so that people would feel less alone and be able to talk to each other. Do you think the stigma around mental health has lessened and that we have begun to have more open conversations about it?There’s an idea that because high-profile people like Prince Harry and Lady Gaga have spoken about it that the box has been ticked. Obviously, more people are having this conversation, but there are still a hell of a lot of others who are too terrified to have it.What do you think about the way that Meghan Markle’s entry into the royal family has played out in the media, especially the apparent fractures between her and Kate?I have met Meghan a few times and I think if you put any family under the microscope, things will come up. I find the media stories are based on a style of journalism that is on its way out, or I thought was on its way out: a nasty pitching of two women against each other who I think get on really well.You’ve run the London marathon for two consecutive years. Are you still running?No, I haven’t run for a while. In the summer, the sun put me off, but now I’m beating myself up about it. Every night I say to myself “Maybe tomorrow.” But I also realise that there will be periods when I’m running and periods when I’m not. I walk a lot these days.You haven’t touched alcohol for 16 months, after an addiction to it. How has day-to-day life changed?It’s immeasurably good so much better, in fact. There are times when it’s hard, but no harder than the alternative. It’s bloody difficult to have an active addiction to alcohol – the stuff you put yourself through! Not drinking is a doddle compared with that. If I ever start fantasising about having one drink, I know the reality would be 85 drinks and a gram of cocaine.My publishers wanted me to write about getting sober, but I said no, because I wasn’t ready to write that book yet. I think it’s really important not to mine parts of your life willy‑nilly it’s got to be real and heartfelt. Mad Girl was an act of desperation – to find people like me – and the stigma attached to talking about it meant I just didn’t meet people who were doing it.The next book you’re working on is a mental health guide for teenagers. What inspired that?I realised I really wanted to write a letter to the 12-year-old me. A lot of the time when I went into rehab, the counsellors would ask me how old I felt, and I would say “Oh, 11 or 12.” I wish that the things I’m learning now, people could have told me about when I was 12.I wouldn’t give back any of my experiences, even if I think a lot of them were unnecessary, but I just wish I had known some life lessons then – some of the things that I think are amazing but no one speaks about, like masturbation, and “girl crushes”, which are really normal. I explored my sexuality and then thought I couldn’t tell anybody but shame is such a dangerous emotion, and so I want to write this book.What would you have been if you hadn’t become a journalist and author?I would probably have been dead. I’m not saying “poor me” – the reality is that I’m fucking lucky. It’s a miracle that I’m here, given my self-destructive and addictive behaviour. The most important thing I have realised is that no one is better than anyone else. We are all fundamentally good and a bit flawed. I think that embracing your flaws is the closest you get to perfection.What are you reading?Educated by Tara Westover, which is fascinating also Bonjour Tristesse by Françoise Sagan and The Lost Properties of Love by Sophie Ratcliffe. Since I got sober, reading has been a real joy for me, because before, I’d get into bed drunk and then not be able to concentrate the next morning because of the hangover. Now I read!Do you read aloud to your daughter? What are her favourite books?Yes, we read to her a lot. We’re reading her Michael Rosen’s poems at the moment. She’s five and has just learned to read, which is a joyous thing to watch her do.• Eat, Drink, Run by Bryony Gordon is published by Headline (£7.99).

Last year saw the third successive annual increase, which ministers acknowledge is a concern, though they point out the numbers are still far fewer than the peak 10 years ago.Education secretary Damian Hinds is due to appear before the education select committee next week when he is expected to be quizzed about rising exclusion rates, ahead of the publication of the government’s review into school exclusion, chaired by Edward Timpson, which is expected in the next few weeks.According to Gill, the most vulnerable children with the most complex needs are disproportionately affected by exclusion, and London has large numbers of them.“Exclusion is correlated with multiple and overlapping layers of disadvantage,” she said. “Growing up in a low-income household, but also having other strains on a child outside of the school gates, like criminal exploitation, grooming and gangs. We know that’s a particular problem in London at the moment.”With mounting concern about the increase in knife crime in the capital, there have been reports that some gangs are giving knives to pupils in order to get them excluded, thereby making those children more vulnerable to gang pressures.“I don’t think it’s fair to say that London has some of the least inclusive schools, but I do think in some local authorities where PRU and AP populations are high but quality is low, we need to seriously prioritise both improving AP quality and reducing school exclusion.”Gill’s new charity will launch a Teach First-style fast-track career programme on Saturday, inviting applications from top quality teachers to train for leadership roles in the sector serving excluded pupils. Successful candidates will spend two years in some of the capital’s best schools for excluded pupils, returning to mainstream with new skills to support vulnerable pupils and reduce exclusions.Sir Tim Brighouse, architect of the London Challenge, will be among those speaking at the launch. “The greatest challenge facing schools is the pandemic in mental ill health among young people,” he said.“The Difference leaders’ programme will create a new generation of school leaders with skills to support the city’s most vulnerable learners, and to reduce school exclusion.”The Department for Education said since 2010 it had taken decisive action to empower teachers to tackle poor behaviour in schools. “Permanently excluding a child from school should only ever be a last resort, but it is wrong to assume that all children in pupil referral units and alternative provision have been excluded from other schools,” a spokesman said.“The department firmly believes that all children, regardless of the setting, should receive a good education and that is why we have committed to reforming alternative provision. We have already made progress and have launched a £4m AP innovation fund which is delivering projects to improve outcomes for children in alternative provision.”Dré Clinton-Barnes, 15, was just 23 minutes into his introductory day at Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney when he fell out with a teacher and was asked to leave. It was an inauspicious start.He and his mother met with staff the following day and Dré returned to classes, but his school career at the celebrated London academy was beset by detentions and isolations. “I talk a lot. I like to have the last word all the time.”His home life was complex, with periods in foster care. He kept running away and ended up being placed in a care home in Ashford in Kent where he cried himself to sleep every night for two weeks. “After that it was calm.”Dré was home-schooled, then got a place at a local secondary school which lost patience with him when he got into a fight. After he was robbed at knife-point, his mother brought him back to London where he struggled to find a school that would accept him.He is now a student at Wac Arts college in Camden, north London – an alternative provision free school for 14- to 19-year-olds, specialising in creative arts and media – and is thriving.“The schools I’ve been to don’t really have patience,” said Dré. “They have a thousand other kids to deal with.” He doesn’t blame them. “I was distracting the class,” he said. In any case things have ended up well.“I live by a philosophy – everything happens for a reason. Here it’s nice. They have more time for students because there’s less students here and teachers explain the work more.”Giulianna Barbosa, 15, has had a similarly disrupted education. She comes from a complex background and has dyslexia. She went to four different primary schools and her time in mainstream secondary school was spent mainly in isolation.“My family says that trouble finds me. I come out of class and there’s a fight. I’m the one that gets isolation for it and I’ve got nothing to do with it,” she said. “I had big arguments with teachers. I kept on being accused of stuff that was nothing to do with me.”Like Dré, Giulianna was never permanently excluded but was the subject of a managed move to Wac Arts college, which suits her interest in creative arts and provides a more flexible approach than mainstream.College principal James Fornara says the rise in exclusions is directly linked to the way schools are now measured through school league tables, which means teachers are under pressure to focus on tests and getting pupils through qualifications. “Young people like Dré and Giulianna who have complicated and challenging lives can’t fit into those boxes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2350cf42895609a469865041cf53516dc3a1fed9/0_0_6500_4333/master/6500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d79de29456ca6a036f6aea9c2c4ff95b 720w","title":"a to z vegan food beginners guide","story":"From aquafaba to za’atar, this handy guide offers tips on ingredients and recipe ideas for a plant-based dietIt’s been called a miracle ingredient, a secret weapon, and the one thing vegans have been waiting for since the term “vegan” was coined in 1944. Aquafaba, or bean water (the liquor from cooking pulses), perfectly mimics egg’s ability to trap air (cue vegan meringue), emulsify (vegan mayonnaise), thicken (vegan ice-cream) and bind (vegan meatballs). Beyond that, Lacey Siomos, who blogs at Avocados and Ales, makes an aquafaba mozzarella that can be sliced, grated and melted – properties that had eluded previous vegan cheeses. For something that until four years ago was only ever drained down the sink, it’s revolutionary.With a neutral flavour profile and rich, built-in creaminess, cashews are key to myriad plant-based takes on non-vegan dishes. When soaked and blended in water, they can be turned into milk, sauces, batters, cheese, creams, icing, caramel … Ready-made snacks, flavour bombs in savoury settings, and natural sweeteners for bakes, puddings and porridge. Many a chef’s secret ingredient, and a must-have in the vegan pantry.Vegan cookbook authors Bosh! best exemplify the DIY creativity that makes vegan cooking so exciting. “You name it, we can do it. It’s just knowing how,” they say. Their takes on pigs in blankets and fried chicken are as good a place as any to start.Ground flax or chia seeds – one tablespoon mixed with three tablespoons of hot water – make an excellent egg substitute in baking, particularly if you’re aiming for “crisp, crunchy biscuits that hold their shape”. Add more liquid – nut milk or fruit juice – and you get a pudding, a smoothie or a porridge. To avoid the unhealthy carb trap of timid vegan cooking, Elizabeth Turner of Forks Over Knives highlights whole grains. From millet and buckwheat to wheat berries and wild rice, they provide both a vehicle for flavour and wholesome heft.Fresh and bunched, or dried to crumble into dishes, it’s all about ramping up flavour (see also za’atar below).You’ll need a decent blender andor food processor to make your own (potentially cheaper, pleasingly fresher) milk alternatives, nut and seed butters, and tahini to blend cashews, blitz beans and whip up hidden-veg smoothies (a great way to ersify your vegetal intake). Some gadgets are definitely worth forking out for.The oversized, fleshy south-east Asian fruit that has pulled-meat aficionados turning vegan. Supermarkets now stock tins of brined pieces, to be turned into the likes of Meera Sodha’s tacos with fried corn and hot cashew sauce.While kombu (or edible kelp) is an unparalleled vegan source of umami (try it slow-braised in water with sweet soy: a revelation), plus the vegan-friendly way to make Japanese soup stock (AKA dashi), the other sea plants out there – from hijiki and nori to dulse and samphire – are as flavourful as they are nutritious.The Birkenstocks of the food world, and for good reason: pulses in general are cheap, easy to prepare, a source of goodness and very adaptable (black beans make fab brownies, cannellini a good lemon drizzle cake, and lentils great crisps). It’s possible to follow a soy-free vegan diet, but it’s not easy. Be it umami-rich miso paste, soy sauce and tofu – with its varieties variously substituting meat, eggs and cream, in contexts both savoury and sweet – or nutty, freshly blanched edamame as a crunchy snack, the range of soy-based possibilities is superb.The Bosh! guys call this magic dust. Heat-treated, it won’t ferment your food, unlike the active yeast in beer and bread, but it will boost its flavour with an addictive, nutty, cheesy tang. Buy it in flake form to add to sauces or scatter on traybakes or blitz with oil, garlic, cayenne pepper and ground cashews, then coat kale leaves to create mind-blowingly good crisps.Always, always pack emergency snacks in case you can’t find vegan food wherever you land up.The one nutritional prerequisite of the vegan diet about which non-vegans are often the most sceptical, and yet, from pulses and seitan to yeast, grains and seeds, there are good sources of vegetal protein.Even a seasoned chef such as J Kenji López-Alt will attest to the new-found culinary pleasure in going vegan, because it forces you to explore the produce aisle like never before. He has blogged about how his consumption of good extra-virgin olive oil has gone up fourfold, and a nascent appreciation for the enormous variety of hot sauces, vinegars, dressings and DIY condiments out there. As with all cooking, your vegan dishes will only ever taste as good as the things you put into them.Meat (and fish, dairy and eggs) is, as López-Alt puts it, the easy answer to: What’s for dinner? So it’s helpful to be clear about why you want to avoid it – whether for animal welfare, environmental or health reasons. This east Asian wheat-gluten product is a go-to meat substitute. Some vegans take issue with the idea of wanting to emulate meat-eating in any way. Others embrace how seitan (much like tempeh and hard tofu) can be sliced, marinated, braised, barbecued, stewed and otherwise meatishly handled.Where tofu is coagulated soy milk curds, tempeh is whole cooked soy beans fermented into a savoury “cake”. The flavour is nutty but neutral (like tofu, it can go anywhere you want it to) and the texture pleasingly dense. It’s easy to make, too. You need good-quality soy beans, a starter culture (try a healthfood shop), an airy container (Kitchn says perforated zip-top bags do the trick nicely) and a warm spot in which to leave it. Try tempeh charred or finely sliced and fried until crisp. It makes a mean savoury crumble, too.Derek Sarno, the US chef behind Tesco’s new plant-based range, says he hasn’t met a mushroom he’s not fond of. And his takes on steak (made with char siu cluster brown mushrooms) and pulled carnitas (smoky and spiked with cumin) prove why: funghi allow you to achieve that savouriness more widely associated with a roast. NHS guidelines single out calcium, vitamin D, iron and vitamin B12 as the nutrients you have to make sure you get enough of. Find them in pulses, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, dark leafy greens and fortified foodstuffs (though quite what breads, drinks and cereals are fortified with might be problematic – see xanthan gum below). It may also be worth looking into supplements.López-Alt’s first monthly foray into vegan eating saw him lose 4.5kg (10lbs) and 80 points of cholesterol. Within a year of eating only plants – and a whole lot of exercise – Decca Aitkenhead had lost 18kg (40lb). Converts to plant-based eating variously speak of clear skin, increased energy levels, eased digestion, and better odds against heart disease and diabetes.An additive commonly used as a thickener, xanthan gum is sometimes made with egg whites, so pay attention to everything that goes into your food. The potential for animal byproducts lies in the most unsuspecting places: fish bladders in beer, anchovy in orange juice, human hair in bread. Cereals don’t always cut it, either, fortified as they often are with lanolin-derived vitamin D. Consult an online guide: the Vegan Society does a good one.Super-rich and silken coconut yoghurt makes a superlative substitute for Greek yoghurt. And it’s perfectly possible to make your own: all you need is coconut milk and a probiotic starter. Try it with other milk alternatives, too: see the Minimalist Baker’s nifty how-to.The herb-and-spice blend most keenly associated with Yotam Ottolenghi’s brand of culinary adventure. The name refers to a Middle Eastern herb, but many blends feature dried thyme, oregano or marjoram, or all three, as well as cumin and sumac. Either way, it’ll make your cooking sing.

Set aside.Heat the remaining extra virgin olive oil in a wide frying pan over a medium–high heat. Add the onion and poblano chillies, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4–5 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary.Add the garlic, and stir for 1 minute. Add the zucchini, and cook for about 4–5 minutes or until the vegetables are golden. Stir in the roasted corn, and cook another 1 or 2 minutes. Stir in the black beans, coriander, remaining salt and 120ml of the reserved sauce, and remove from the heat.Spread 120ml of the sauce on the bottom of the prepared dish. Spoon about one-sixteenth of the filling into the centre of 1 tortilla, filling it generously, and gently roll and place in the dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling, fitting them snugly into the dish. Pour some of the remaining sauce over the top of the enchiladas, lightly covering them while leaving edges exposed, and sprinkle with the cheese (if using). Cover with foil, and bake for about 40 minutes or until hot and bubbling.Extra: For Tortilla Soup, stir 480ml sauce into 480ml vegetable stock. Heat and stir in 30g lightly crushed tortilla chips and 175g black beans. Serve topped with a spoonful of plant-based sour cream and diced avocado."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a323d98011cf960b9c0d24f492d32d877fe0e44/0_196_2445_1467/master/2445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f813635ae3884fb62c7191150664d3d","title":"harry kane tottenham manchester united","story":"I don’t remember watching it live,” says Harry Kane of the 1999 Champions League final, which took place when he was five years old. “I did see the highlights, though. When you watch it back and see how they turned it around, it shows anything is possible in football.”Not only a chastening reminder that Manchester United’s treble is now a long time ago, Kane’s remarks also show the Tottenham striker in typical form: straightforward and polite, smart enough to find the courteous way to answer most questions. When he fronts up to the media, as he often does, Kane is diplomatic not defensive and underneath, a motivational message: if anything is possible in football, what might Spurs achieve? It wasn’t just the goals that earned him that MBE.The reason for Kane playing nice about a match he cannot remember is Sunday’s big Premier League encounter: Tottenham v Manchester United at Wembley. Ole Gunnar Solskjær, he of the late, late knee-slide in Barcelona, arrives at the national stadium hoping to extend his run of five consecutive victories since taking temporary charge at Old Trafford. Spurs, meanwhile, are trying to keep a four-pronged trophy hunt running for another week.“United have been in great form and are coming off some great results,” Kane says. “They are going to be confident and they are going to have a lot of energy. They won’t have played midweek like we have. We have to bring that same energy. That’s when we’re at our best, when we’re pressing and everyone is on the front foot. That is what we are going to need on Sunday.”One way of looking at the midweek Carabao Cup match against Chelsea is that it offered a different type of challenge for Spurs in their encounters with fellow big-six clubs. Edged out of games against Liverpool and Manchester City in the Premier League, Spurs were outgunned by Arsenal in a shooting match. But Mauricio Pochettino’s side have also turned over both Chelsea and United in a manner that suggested they were the team with the experience and honours, not the other way around.So, on Tuesday evening, Chelsea reacted and set about Spurs as if they had a point to prove. Maurizio Sarri wanted to show they could match their London rivals in determination and physical commitment. Most observers would agree they achieved this. Chelsea also had the bulk of possession, much of it in Tottenham’s defensive third. Yet they created few real chances, Spurs were happy to play on the break and, most importantly, they still won the first leg of the tie.If you accept that version of events then the semi-final saw Spurs playing conservatively, but as favourites, while Chelsea were the underdogs, willing to give their all for victory. It was precisely the opposite approach to that taken by Antonio Conte in an FA Cup semi-final two seasons ago – when the then Chelsea manager drew the sting from Spurs before introducing Eden Hazard late in the game to devastating effect – and it may not be the position the teams find themselves in when they come to play again at Stamford Bridge a week on Thursday. But if it was the case, it might well be the same again for Sunday’s visit of United.“United have an amazing history and have won so many titles, a lot more than Tottenham have. What we have done as a team with Mauricio and the staff is to change the perception of Spurs over the last three or four years. We are at the stage now where we have a mature team. We are not young any more. It’s important we keep ourselves at this high level, at the top. I know that the teams around us know it’s difficult to play us and we have to use that to our advantage.“United will come and try to play with a lot of energy. We have to make sure we match that. When we match their intensity, keep the ball and make it hard for them, that’s when we can do damage.”Kane knows full well how to do damage, of course. His arching header set Spurs on their way to victory at Old Trafford in August. That was one of just two goals in the first month of the season as he struggled to shake off the effects of a long season that bled into a the World Cup. In the past few weeks, however, he has been back to his best. Kane is once again agile enough to make defenders sweat in a sprint, strong enough to hold the ball anywhere on the field and cute enough to either draw fouls or play teammates in beyond him. He has seven goals in his last six games and his match-winning penalty against Chelsea made him the first Spurs player to score 20 goals in a season for five consecutive years.In scoring on Tuesday Kane also surpassed Cliff Jones’s career total of 159 goals for the Lilywhites. It is sometimes hard to recognise when watching players who are making history, but Kane is at that level for club and country. Pochettino said he gave Kane a cameo in the FA Cup demolition of Tranmere a week ago as an opportunity for Prenton Park regulars to see “an icon of English football”. He wasn’t exaggerating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Last week Outlander star Tom Brittney complained about the emphasis on achieving a “built” body before auditions. British drama schools are also tackling the pressure on students to conform to a muscular type.“It is real and prevalent, and we are very aware,” said Vanessa Ewan, a senior lecturer in movement at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.Speaking to Radio Times, Brittney admitted some of his roles were now dependent on a strict gym regimen and diet. “It’s tough. And I would hope the industry pulls back from that,” the actor said. Last summer the comic Noel Fielding also confessed he got more work when he looked thinner. Hard luck on a host of Bake Off.Such sentiments were echoed this weekend by a group of male acting students who fear, like Brittney, that appearing in peak condition is now part of their job.“Of course there is a responsibility to look after ourselves as we train,” said Russell Scott-Dickson, 21, a Belfast-born student at Arts Educational Schools in London. “But there is a pressure to look that bit leaner, because it is going to help. And agents say to us that our image is the most important part of the package. We all deal with it differently, but it can obviously lead to problems like body dysmorphia or eating illnesses.”The fad for “bulk and muscle” that trainee actors and tutors identify is the latest in a succession of key screen looks. In the 1950s, bare-chested stars such as Johnny Weissmuller of the Tarzan films, or Burt Lancaster in From Here to Eternity, were broad rather than toned. They were replaced in the 1960s by the clean-cut, preppy looks of Robert Redford and Paul Newman, while in Britain during the late 1980s what really counted was having the undernourished, rarefied outline of a Rupert Everett or a Julian Sands.The new age of brawn has been ushered in by Aidan Turner’s Poldark, Idris Elba’s Luther and Richard Madden’s Bodyguard. Even the languid and cerebral Holmes in the BBC’s Sherlock, as played by Benedict Cumberbatch, annoyed some viewers with his unfeasibly developed upper arms.“It is an odd phenomenon,” said Catherine Alexander, a course leader at Central. “We talk about it a lot.” Referring to the Game of Thrones actor, Alexander said she knew it as the Kit Harington effect and believed it actually limited performances.“It is detrimental when people build up too much muscle because we convey emotion through our chests. An overly muscular chest is a barrier. The actor can’t make that connection, so we encourage our students to stop doing weights all the time,” she said.Taylor Bradshaw, 20, a student from south London, welcomes the support he gets at ArtsEd, which offers a gym and a coach, but he understands the need to represent reality. “Hopefully we will play different kinds of people. Not all the parts out there are soldiers and bodyguards,” he said.Beefing up for a role can be seen as just part of the essential artifice of performance, one of the tricks replicated down the ages, from theatrical masks to the soft-focus camera lens and contemporary special effects of Hollywood but it is also a reflection of wider modern tastes.“We live in self-obsessed and image-conscious times and nowhere more so than in the TV and film industry,” said Bradshaw.Ewan, who runs a bodyidentityimage group at Central to help students, is worried about a blurring of lines between an actor’s personal image and the parts they hope to play. She also suspects the desire for bulk is about wanting control in a difficult marketplace. “The actor needs to discern the difference between a personal decision and a professional decision. The line is slim,” she said. “An actor faced with a free personal trainer in a first job sees that as a bonus and he may not recognise he is handing over more than he is gaining.”Drama schools, Ewan argues, are there to give actors the tools to transform without the need to change body shape. Leo Woodall, 22, another student, agrees and hopes the entertainment industry can avoid reproducing identikit leading men. The drive to look like the four American blockbusting stars, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine and Chris Pratt, does not encourage good mental health.“While it is true people want to look at beautiful people, they also want to see real people with imperfections. I like to be in shape, but I would not want to get too big because it would restrict me,” he said.Even a top-ranked star like Evans is not happy with the trend. He has complained, along with the actor Armie Hammer, that being seen as a muscular hunk in the Captain America role may send his career off into a dead end. The answer might be to let visual effects do the work. Certainly, producers of mass-market entertainment spend a big proportion of the budget on improving the look of the stars. Los Angeles is home to several profitable low-profile effects companies that specialise in digitally beautifying every shot with patented programmes such as Flame or Beauty Box. And in the cruel world of high-definition cinema, these efforts to remove stomach rolls and improve silhouettes are now as concentrated on the male actors as the female.Ewan regularly points out to students at Central how much easier it is to put on muscle for a role, either with exercise, padded costumes, or with CGI, than it is to slim down. And she acknowledges that it is an issue female actors “have been dealing with for ever”. As Brittney remarked last week: “Maybe it’s the guys’ turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b989f63333e5b31cd0cbd473873dc8eb472fbe/0_29_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e22287431482c14554d172362eb2ae4","title":"podcast future of education","story":"Submit your questions and ideas to our panel of experts who will discuss what can be learnt from different approaches to educationJoin our panel of education experts to examine what can be done to improve education, and make systems more equal. Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, says:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We’re even further from ensuring the world’s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.”One thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing – we know where we want to get to, but we don’t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.What are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?On a macro level, should we be trying new methods to engage leaders? Are there aspects of schools and teaching that you believe are outdated? Are there any good alternatives to excessive tests and exams? How can we plan long term or indeed collaboratively within education? How can we better prepare our children for life in the modern world? How can we incentivise more people to teach, and have the space to adopt more creative techniques in their teaching? Looking more locally, what can communities do to change how schools are run in their area – to create a level playing field for children and improve access for those from poorer backgrounds?As Beard eloquently puts it: “In general, I think people don’t fundamentally understand what it means to learn – and to teach. Most policymakers don’t, and I certainly don’t think that people outside of education really do. Our society imagines that teaching means standing at the front of a classroom and talking about ideas. If we want to begin to create a better system, we all need a much deeper understanding of the nature of learning: the science of learning.”To contribute, you can fill in our encrypted form below.

Labour whips have told MPs the no-confidence vote is likely to be tabled within hours of a government loss, with the actual vote taking place on Wednesday.The news comes before what promises to be one of the most tumultuous 24 hours in recent parliamentary history in which, barring another delay, May will put her Brexit deal to parliament despite deep and widespread opposition across the Commons, including from many MPs inside her own party.A senior shadow cabinet member said: “There is now recognition that we cannot wait any longer. If May goes down to defeat and she does not resign and call an election, this is the moment we have to act.”Senior Tories said on Saturday that they could not see how the prime minister could win the meaningful vote “in any circumstances” and that a defeat by less than 100 would now be regarded as the best she could hope for.But even if she suffered a loss of closer to 200, which many Tories fear could be the case, Conservative MPs and ministers still expect her to stagger on and seek to bring an improved offer back to the Commons for a further vote within weeks.Although senior Labour figures accept they are unlikely to win a no-confidence vote, as the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs have said they will back the government, the move will highlight the fragility of May’s hold on power as the Brexit crisis deepens.Yet should Corbyn fail to force an election, it will place the Labour leader under greater pressure from many of his own MPs, as well as party members and supporters, to throw his weight behind a second referendum as the way to break the Brexit impasse.Labour’s current policy is to seek to force an election, and if it wins, to renegotiate a new Brexit deal. Senior shadow cabinet figures said any further delay in tabling a no-confidence motion will make that position untenable, as there will be insufficient time before Britain’s exit from the EU on 29 March to hold an election.The Observer understands that if Corbyn were to delay tabling a vote of no confidence, senior Labour MPs would table one themselves in the hope of forcing the leadership to back a second referendum. Angela Smith, Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said: “The time for prevarication is over. If May’s deal fails we have to test the will of the house and if we fail, we must consider all options including campaigning for a second referendum as this is party policy.”A Labour spokesman, while not confirming a vote on Tuesday, said that while the timing of a no-confidence vote had not been fixed, MPs had been told to be ready. Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade minister, said last week that a vote of no confidence would “obviously” have to follow immediately after a defeat for May’s deal.A Momentum activist, Michael Chessum, spokesman for the leftwing anti-Brexit campaign Another Europe is Possible, said that if Labour won the confidence vote, it would be time for Corbyn to back a second referendum as part of the Labour manifesto. If it lost, it should campaign for one as the official opposition.He said: “Proposing a no-confidence motion is the first step for either scenario, and we need to get on with it.” Labour campaigners for a second referendum claim that the party’s policy forum has received more than 13,000 emails and letters urging Corbyn to oppose Brexit.Writing in the Observer, London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan said that he will step up his campaign for another referendum if an election is not called immediately: “A public vote would not only allow us to move beyond the current stalemate but would actually start the desperately needed process of healing the deep isions that have opened within our society.” Roy Hattersley, the veteran Labour politician, also threw his weight behind a second referendum on Saturday, saying the British people had “a right to cast a vote on the merits” of May’s deal.Meanwhile, pro-remain cabinet ministers are preparing to push for a softer Brexit this week. In the event of a defeat for May, they are poised to back a plan B that would prevent Britain from signing its own trade deals.It is understood some believe that joining a permanent customs union with the EU could be enough to secure a Commons majority for May’s deal. This could be one option put forward in a series of indicative votes to test the views of MPs on alternatives if her plan is thrown out. Such a move would potentially attract a bloc of Labour MPs. With a critical week ahead, Tory rebels are already plotting a series of measures designed to hand more power to parliament over Brexit. One senior figure said that a “legally copper-bottomed” plan had already been drawn up to “give parliament control of the Brexit negotiation and stop a no-deal Brexit” should May’s deal be voted down.A vote to show there is a Commons majority in favour of delaying Brexit is also being plotted by a cross-party group of MPs. “If we are not crashing out and we are not going for the PM’s deal, I cannot believe that article 50 does not have to be extended,” said one of those involved.The business secretary, Greg Clark, also writing in the Observer, has appealed to pro-Brexit Labour MPs to back May’s deal, insisting that the government would protect workers’ rights when the UK is outside the EU.

Despite my doubts about the European Union as an institution (its remoteness, lack of democracy, and inflexibility in dealing with crises such as the eurozone debt), I was, and remain, convinced that it’s better for nations to work together to deal with problems than apart.Since then, the chaotic fallout of the vote has made Brexit seem even more scary: we have witnessed an unstable government, inept negotiations, early signs of the economic damage to come, and a looming no-deal outcome.So why is it that, almost by the day, I grow more and more sympathetic to the people who voted leave? Not to the Boris Johnsons and Jacob Rees-Moggs, of course, nor to the middle-class little-Englanders across the Tory shires – nor either to the thuggish nationalist bigots of the far right: but to the millions of ordinary working-class voters who saw leaving the EU as a way to improve their lives and finally have their voices heard.Remember that brief moment after the referendum, when commentators started acknowledging the “left behind”, admitting that they’d been ignored for far too long? The swaths of the country beyond the M25 where industries had been lost, where communities had been torn apart, and where the idea of prosperity was a long-forgotten dream.What happened? Before long the Westminster village reverted to type, and began obsessing about political plots, obscure article wording, and parliamentary procedures. All the talk switched to meaningful votes – yet in vast stretches of the UK, what they want is meaningful lives.And amid the panic to stop Brexit, their stories have been forgotten. It often seems the message to them from remainers can be boiled down to two words: “Stupid northerners.”There’s been little attempt to acknowledge the widespread poverty, deprivation, insecurity and marginalisation of so many towns and cities that led them to seek such a drastic solution to their problems. Yes, of course it’s clear that all the predictions are for the economy to take a hit and the poorer, northern regions to take the biggest hit of all: “What on earth were you thinking,” the liberal commentariat say (it’s a statement, not a question). Yet they fail to realise that these parts of the country have mostly been untouched by economic growth, even in the so-called boom years.I was born and raised in Hull, a medium-sized, solidly working-class city in east Yorkshire. I remember the Thatcher recession of the 1980s, and the hit the city took, along with the collapse of its fishing industry. I also remember feeling incredulous when the media, over the following years, reported the economic boom: the yuppies, the “big bang” in the City of London, the “share-owning democracy”. None of that was felt anywhere near us.And little has changed. The only two regions of the UK that have recovered after the 2008 crash are London and the south-east. So, during the referendum campaign, to raise the economy as a reason for staying in Europe was always likely to fall on deaf ears – and it did. Yet since 2016, remarkably, most remainers seem to feel that if they keep repeating this message, somehow people will change their minds. It won’t work. Nor will that other continuously repeated phrase: “You were lied to.” As if leave voters are so gullible they’d believe anything politicians tell them: in fact, they voted Brexit because they totally distrusted politicians. All these remainer arguments do is make people feel their protest vote is being ignored, and that establishment voices just want things to carry on as before.There’s a great scene in James Graham’s 2017 play Labour of Love, which centres on a Nottingham Labour MP and his constituency agent, played in its original production by Tamsin Greig. At the end of another long day pounding the streets, trying to show voters how her party can improve their lives, she says wistfully: “What a glorious peace, it must be, to be on the Right. To wake up every morning and look around and think – yeah, this is pretty much how it should be.” The same is true over the EU vote: working-class Brexiters could equally think, “It must be glorious being a remainer ...”Certainly, few of them are likely to be persuaded by the leading voices in the people’s vote campaign – almost all wealthy and middle class, and most of them southerners. The same is true of almost all remainer commentators in the media. The notion of the “metropolitan elite” used to seem like a ridiculous putdown yet, more and more, it seems to be becoming a truth. “The people have spoken. The people must be wrong,” seems to be their mantra.And in the face of their impotence over changing hearts and minds, and as Theresa May drives on towards the cliff edge, they turn to the one person they know they can damage: Jeremy Corbyn.“Why won’t Labour’s leader help us and make all this nightmare end?” they say. It is of little importance to them that Labour, as a national political party, has to listen to the voices of its northern voters nor that Corbyn has, so far, played a tactically astute game.Of course, this mattered little in the media world – dominated as it is by Oxbridge graduates, especially at its most senior levels. These are the people who have least to fear from austerity, and the most to lose from leaving Europe nor do they have to worry about migrants moving in next door or changing their neighbourhoods, taking their jobs or undercutting their wages. To them, the concerns of poorer or working-class areas are irrational, merely evidence of their simple-mindedness. So the commentators demand Labour ditch all connection with its heartlands.“This shouldn’t be about tactics,” they insist, “it’s about putting the country first.” Yet, conveniently, they forget that Tony Blair used exactly the same strategy for humiliating and discrediting the John Major government during the 1990s. Blair stayed “constructively ambiguous” over the big European questions of the day – Maastricht, and joining the euro – while the Tory prime minister was skewered by his eurosceptic “bastards”. The only significant difference to today is that the media establishment loved Blair (private school, Oxbridge, centrist – “one of us”), so they saw his manoeuvrings as the work of a genius. When, in an interview just before Christmas, the Labour leader repeated the carefully crafted thinking behind his party’s Brexit policy adopted just three months earlier, he was accused of “defying” his membership. He’s accused of secretly voting in favour of Brexit in 2016 (which goes to prove that you don’t have to be a Trump supporter to believe fake news). And party members are urged to revolt against him.They claim Corbyn is a hopeless leader. But if that was true, the whole Brexit issue would be playing out completely differently. Given May has shown herself to be totally out of her depth, any ambitious Tory leader-in-waiting (and there are several) would have taken her on by now, ousted her, and called a new general election to gain a solid majority and the chance to put through their own kind of Brexit deal.Yet they haven’t. Why not? Because they know Corbyn’s message of ending austerity and taxing the rich still resonates. In fact it’s Corbyn who’s calling for an election, confident he can take his party to victory. And if he did, who knows what might happen over Brexit?Corbyn, unlike his liberal critics, understands that Brexit is a matter of timing. If you oppose it too soon, you’ll be labelled as someone who never accepted the referendum result, showing contempt for the 17.4 million leave voters. When thousands took to the streets demanding a people’s vote last summer, I couldn’t help thinking that, up north, many leave voters would be digging their heels in even further.Something dramatic has to happen before Labour changes the stance which proved so popular at the last election. The past few weeks have felt like the start of that drama: a dud deal cabinet resignations the withdrawal vote pulled at the last minute a Tory leadership challenge a parliament asserting itself over the government. In the following days there will be more such moments.If May’s deal is voted on and then defeated, everything will change.Paradoxically, even if May gets her deal through, she will automatically lose the support of the DUP and therefore provide the very real prospect of the government losing a no-confidence motion. (So if Corbyn really was putting his party’s interests above the country’s, he’d back May’s deal and create this very scenario.)Assuming her deal is defeated, this would indeed be a moment for Corbyn to push for an election. And given the calamity of no-deal, which was certainly not on the side of any bus in 2016, it would also be a valid moment to call for a second referendum.Either of these options would provide the potential to alter Britain’s current catastrophic trajectory. I’d back them both. But if I had to choose between an election or a second referendum, I think that ultimately it would have to be for the option that could transform Britain – rather than the one under which things would remain just the same.• Joseph Harker is the ’s deputy opinion editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7651688eb37b1b5bd5c7e7c4f7b4af70a91ddc9/75_267_3850_2310/master/3850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=307788b8237c62868d89b25aeaf37bd5","title":"newcastle food poverty project empowerment","story":"To look at, the self-styled Byker Pantry barely gives reason to stop. A short walk from Newcastle’s famous Byker Wall, its diminutive blue-shuttered front blends in with everything around it. But behind its scruffy exterior a quiet revolution is taking place.With more than 200 members, the pantry initially attracts people with its offer of heavily discounted food. For most of them, though, the reason they end up staying is much deeper – the rediscovery of self-worth and self-empowerment.Like so many communities across the north of England, a decade of austerity topped off with the rollout of universal credit has hit Byker and many parts of Newcastle hard.Just two months ago, the UN’s Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, was in the city hearing stories of desperation and deprivation and spending time at the country’s busiest food bank in the city’s west end.But as help from the local authority has been withdrawn as a result of cuts in government funding, projects across the city are springing up, both to help meet basic needs and also to rekindle the sense of community that so many working-class areas hold dear.Run by Mike and Ann Leddra through the Life Vineyard Church, Byker Pantry was born out of a food bank but evolved into a discounted food store where customers who pay a monthly subscription can use points on a card to spend in the shop. The Leddras wanted to set up a sustainable longterm solution to the challenges of poverty, unemployment and wage stagnation. They see the pantry, a charity, as a service through which people can transition after a crisis, and they estimate that families save £500 a year through the scheme, which also enables them to accrue bonus points on their cards.“People choose what food they want, and it empowers our members to make those decisions,” said Ann, 61, a former nurse. “It gives them ownership and a sense of worth because they are in control of what they get and how they use it.“They can buy food at about half the price they would pay in the shops, and our aim is to help people out of difficult situations and into an easier place in life. We want to maximise their money but also their potential it’s not just about being a shop, it’s about building community, and in a community people share their problems.”Ann and former lecturer Mike, 63, could talk for hours about the friends they have made through running the project. “I remember speaking to a mum after she first started coming who said it was the first time they had ever had money left over at the end of the month,” said Mike. “Six months later the dad said they had just put carpets down and they had never had carpets before. Most people take that for granted, but not necessarily the people in this community.“Another man spent every penny he had on buying his children school uniforms, and he said if it wasn’t for the pantry they would have had nothing to eat during the school holidays.”Just under two miles away, in Shieldfield, a similar story is told through Andy Haddon’s Artisan Baking Community. Haddon has been running community baking sessions for many years and is now crowdfunding to set up a permanent home in the city.His aim is to offer high-quality, affordable bread but also help others gain the confidence to do it themselves in other areas.“Local food should be healthy and affordable to everyone. But how do you make that happen? Well, we started with bread, so I started a bakery six years ago and we want to make it into a hub in the community, and Shieldfield feels like the perfect place for it,” he said.“We’re doing it with bread, but really it’s about the impact on the people that we work with. Food for so long has been about profit for the big supermarkets – often unhealthy food too. So across the north-east we want to ensure good and affordable food is available to everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff21e97da94a6f125716c86313ecb6f534bddeff/0_170_3863_2319/master/3863.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a4868f3f1fc4b102b460ca502ef62bf","title":"cowboys rams chiefs colts nfl playoffs","story":"Patrick Mahomes picked apart the Colts in his postseason debut, the Chiefs defense answered their chorus of critics with a stout performance, and Kansas City rolled to a 31-13 victory over Indianapolis in the isional round Saturday to end 25 years of playoff frustration.Mahomes threw for 278 yards while running for a touchdown, and Damien Williams ran through snow and muck for 129 yards and another score, as the Chiefs beat Indianapolis for the first time in five playoff meetings to earn their first AFC title game appearance since January 1994.There was a lot of excitement here, the fans were awesome, the defense played amazing and the offense, we did enough to get the win in the end,” Mahomes said.The AFC West champions will play the winner of Sunday’s game between the ision-rival Los Angeles Chargers and the New England Patriots next weekend for a spot in the Super Bowl in Atlanta.Andrew Luck was held to 203 yards passing for the Colts, while Marlon Mack was a non-factor on the ground. He had 46 yards rushing before leaving late in the fourth quarter with a hip injury.With persistent snow turning Arrowhead Stadium into a winter wonderland, the Chiefs waltzed all over a Colts defense that nearly shut out the Texans a week ago. Mahomes and co scored on their first three possessions, then again just before halftime, to take a 24-7 lead into the break.If there was any question whether this would be Kansas City’s day, it was answered when Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri missed a 23-yard field goal try off the upright just before halftime. It was the first time in 22 postseason attempts that he’d missed from that close.Not that the Chiefs thought they had it wrapped up.They’ve had bigger playoff meltdowns against the Colts.There was the 10-7 loss in which Lin Elliott missed three field goals when the Chiefs were the No 1 seed, and the loss at Arrowhead Stadium in 2003 in which nobody punted.Five years ago, they blew a 38-10 second-half lead against Luck and the Colts to spoil Andy Reid’s first season.Not this time.Not with this Kansas City quarterback.After shattering nearly every franchise passing record, Mahomes picked up right where he left off in his regular-season finale. He led the Chiefs on touchdown drives of 90 and 70 yards to open the game, quickly identified a favorite target in Travis Kelce, and shook off a banged-up knee to scramble for a touchdown late in the first half to give his team a big cushion.Of course, the Chiefs didn’t need it the way their defense was playing.The Colts went three-and-out on their first four possessions, were outgained 185-12 in the first quarter, and Luck didn’t complete a pass until he found TY Hilton early in the second.Their lone bright spot came when Zach Paschal recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown.Even when the Colts caught a break and Sammy Watkins fumbled the ball to them late in the third quarter, they were quick to give it back. Dee Ford stripped Luck and fellow linebacker Justin Houston plopped on the ball, ruining another red-zone opportunity.The Colts finally scored an offensive touchdown with 5:31 left in the game. But in the perfect summation of their lousy afternoon, their erstwhile star kicker missed the extra point.By that point, the party in the stands already had begun.The Chiefs had lost six straight home playoff games, including heartbreakers to Pittsburgh and Tennessee the past two years. But a proud franchise that won its only Super Bowl title with Len Dawson in 1970, and last played for a spot behind Joe Montana, is once more one step away.CJ Anderson rushed for 123 yards and two touchdowns, and Todd Gurley rushed for 115 more and another TD in the Los Angeles Rams’ first playoff victory in 14 years, 30-22 over the Dallas Cowboys in the isional round on Saturday night.Gurley and Anderson punished the Cowboys’ normally sturdy run defense and sent the second-seeded Rams (14-3) to the NFC championship game for the first time in 17 years.Ezekiel Elliott rushed for a TD and Amari Cooper caught an early TD pass for the Cowboys (11-7), who still haven’t won a playoff game on the road in 26 years. After winning the NFC East and beating Seattle last week, Dallas lost in the isional playoff round for the sixth consecutive time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c461e11d1e9f2cfe279fc1d1d9cbceac898a572/0_82_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b5ed3df6d925d7904c67c81e6e1452e","title":"nick kyrgios andy murray australian open tennis","story":"The Australian tennis player pays tribute to the opponent with whom he formed the closest of bonds off the courtWe just had a lot of banter between each other.

We knew when we were together it was going to be a lot of fun and a lot of banter and some good vibes. He’s hilarious, he’s so funny.His tennis gets enough recognition. He was an unbelievable player. He was one of the toughest people I ever played against. But I don’t think he gets enough credit for how he was off the court, just as a normal person. He was so humble, he was so down to earth, he just loved to have some fun, he loved to have a good time.I genuinely got excited to be at the courts and maybe see him during the day and have some lunch with him and just catch up. He made your day better.He took me under his wing when I was young, but then when he knew that I was kind of a free spirit, doing whatever I want to do, it just became more of a friendly-type relationship. When we were together, we never talked about tennis. There was just so much shit-talking and banter, it was so good.Everyone knew that when we were together it was just good vibes, everyone knew that it was so laid‑back. It was so easy to be around him. It was awesome and I’m going to miss him a lot.I knew that I couldn’t play long rallies with him and I knew I couldn’t last against him. I would have loved to have played him when he was in his prime as I am now, it would maybe have been a much more competitive match.It would have been cool to play doubles with him once.

That’s how difficult it was.”If the former world No 1’s match against the Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday is his last public appearance on a tennis court – as he fears it might be – he will leave to rapturous applause and the gratitude of a generation. Despite beating Agut in their three previous matches, Murray does not expect to win.The Scot said he was determined to follow advice from psychologists and delay making decisions about what he does next.“I don’t want to stop playing tennis just now,” he admitted. “I don’t feel ready, the rest of my body feels perfect.“That’s the hard thing about it. It’s not like I wake up and my whole body’s sore, and just aching, and it’s too much. It’s just one problem that can’t be fixed. That’s why it’s difficult. Look, lots of things have been weird. Like, the US Open last year for me was quite odd, because I was in a lot of pain.”There he lost to Fernando Verdasco in the second round. He lost to him again in Shenzhen – and that was it for 2018 – 12 matches, seven defeats and nothing to show for it but a seemingly ineradicable limp and dwindling hopes after 15 years as a professional.“I know I’ve got no chance of winning this tournament and most likely I’m going to lose in the first round. I’m not happy about that. Because of the way the last six months of competing have gone, I could win but it’s likely that I won’t. It’s going to be uncomfortable,” he said.“If it is my last match, I want to try and enjoy it – enjoy the whole experience, which is maybe something during my career that I’ve not done. I’ve always been focused on tactics and winning and finding a way that’s been the most important thing.”What Murray wants to do after spending nearly his entire life playing tennis is to have some fun, play five-a-side with his mates, and fit in some golf – which might have been his chosen sport, if his father, Willie, had had his way, rather than his mother, Judy, who steered him towards tennis.He could have been a footballer. But tennis, with its inbuilt frustrations and challenges, its quirks of scoring and circumstances, suited his mercurial rhythm. It gave him a canvas on which to paint his particular art. Few did it more artfully. Manufacturing a graceful departure has not been easy, though.“Coming in here, my mindset is… it feels very different. Like, the other day, I was saying to my team: ‘The thing that’s difficult – because I’m not practising anywhere near as much as I used to – is I can’t just go back on the practice court and work on my serve or whatever I’m not happy with – I can’t do that any more.’“But it’s interesting because once I’d started thinking about stopping, that there was a possibility that I wasn’t going to be playing much longer, all of the things that I thought I would quite like to do, I have zero interest in doing right now.“I have no motivation to do anything else just now. Thinking about what I do when I finish playing and rushing into decisions – from speaking to psychologists – is the worst thing I should be doing. It’s going to take time for me to deal with it. I need time to get over it and then to know what my next steps are going to be.“I know that will be difficult. I love tennis. I love playing the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2874fec4f2d100ec1f57e89d9f965e98 1290w","title":"the ultimate vegan friday night feast","story":"You’ve made it through the week, and now you want to celebrate with some good food. Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top. I did have to lie down afterwards to deal with the sugar rush, but it was more than worth it.If you do Friday nights in right (more food, less boozing), you may even find that you’re curiously light on your feet and awake enough to make it to your 9am yoga class the next morning.See, Veganuary could be just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus.

Grease and line the base of a 20cm round cake tin with baking paper, then set aside.Pour the dairy-free milk into a jug, add the vinegar and leave to stand for 5 minutes, or until it turns lumpy.Tip the dairy-free spread into a mixing bowl, add the sugar and beat with a wooden spoon. Gradually add the dairy-free milk mixture – don’t worry if it curdles. Add the vanilla extract, then stir in the flour and baking powder until smooth.Scrape the cake batter into the tin. Smooth the surface and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, line the inside of a bowl with two pieces of clingfilm and overlap them to create an X. Scoop the Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s out of the container and press into the lined dish. Cover and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour, until hard.Put the cake on to a serving plate, spread the top with your choice of jam. Invert the ice-cream on top of the sponge, using the clingfilm to help ease the ice-cream out. Return to the freezer for 1 hour.To make the meringue, drain the chickpeas in a sieve, making sure you catch the water that drains out – this is the base for your meringue (aquafaba). Add the xanthan gum, cream of tartar and vanilla extract. Use an electric whisk to beat the aquafaba to stiff peaks – it’ll take about 10 minutes. After 5 minutes, gradually add in the sugar, beating after each addition, until the meringue is thick and glossy.Remove the ice-cream-topped cake from the freezer, spread the meringue over the surface in a thick layer, mounding it slightly higher on top. Return the covered alaska to the freezer and freeze for 2 hours.Remove the alaska from the freezer and use a cook’s blowtorch to brown the meringue. Serve immediately, cut into generous wedges. Leftovers can be stored in the freezer for a couple of days.Tip: Dollop dessert spoons of leftover meringue onto a lined baking tray and cook on your oven’s lowest setting for 1 hour, or until crisp. These will keep in an airtight container and can be served with more of your favourite non-dairy Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ice-cream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d20c289fefab5caf4b03fcfc4b4588ba419346f7/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0cfb33022a1a999e6f8806ab47eb6ba","title":"facebook staff discussed cashing in on user data reports say","story":"Proposals to charge firms for data said to have been revealed by badly redacted court papersFacebook staff discussed charging companies for access to user data, before ultimately deciding against such a policy, according to reports.The internal discussions were revealed due to improperly redacted court documents, released as part of Facebook’s lawsuit against American software developer Six4Three last year. According to Ars Technica and the Wall Street Journal, an 18-page court filing contains three pages that were supposed to be blacked out because they contain “sensitive discussion of Facebook’s internal strategic analysis of third-party applications”, Facebook said in other court filings.But while the sensitive discussions were masked with a black bar, the underlying text was not removed from digital versions of the documents, allowing it to be uncovered.That text reportedly shows Facebook staff discussing how to use access to user data to extract higher advertising spend from major clients, in emails dating from 2012 and 2013. The conversations occurred at roughly the time that Facebook decided to change the way third-party developers could access user data, which had the effect of closing the hole through which Cambridge Analytica partner GSR had managed to extract the personal information of millions of Facebook users.In the filings, the Wall Street Journal reports, one employee proposes blocking access “in one go to all apps that don’t spend … at least $250k a year to maintain access to the data”.Elsewhere, the filings suggest that Facebook offered to extend the length of time Tinder could continue using the old, more permissive terms of access in exchange for a licence for the dating company’s trademark on the term “Moments”.There is no suggestion that Facebook acted on the proposals, and the company has always maintained that it tightened the restrictions on what could be done with its public access for privacy and security reasons.The filings are drawn from a set of Facebook emails obtained by Six4Three in the discovery portion of its lawsuit against the social network, subsequently sealed by the Californian court. On Sunday, however, the UK parliament seized copies of the emails from Six4Three’s chief executive, and quoted from them during its grilling of a Facebook executive on Tuesday.During the hearings, Labour’s Clive Effort asked whether “apps were shut down on the basis that they could not pay a large sum of money for mobile advertising”, and whether apps were “whitelisted” based on their advertising spend. Richard Allan, Facebook’s head of public policy in Europe, said no to both.In a statement, Facebook’s director of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, told the : “As we’ve said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for this baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context.” Facebook declined a request to provide the  with the emails in their additional context, saying: “Evidence has been sealed by a California court so we are not able to disprove every false accusation.”Papamiltiadis added: “That said, we stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends’ data with developers. Any short-term extensions granted during this platform transition were to prevent the changes from breaking user experience.“To be clear, Facebook has never sold anyone’s data. Our APIs have always been free of charge and we have never required developers to pay for using them, either directly or by buying advertising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd0829730314ac65451bdfe2fdc9b4c1c0383580/0_260_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0896985c3880aab376d5895ce71a534c","title":"julian castro president democrat san antonio texas speech","story":"Obama housing secretary would be first Hiic American nominee if he beats Democratic field likely to number 20 or moreJulián Castro, the federal housing secretary under Barack Obama, announced his presidential bid on Saturday with an address in his home city of San Antonio, Texas, where he served for five years as mayor.Delivering remarks in both English and Spanish, Castro said: “When my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago, I’m sure she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for president of the United States of America.”The 44-year-old, who rose to national prominence with an electrifying keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic convention, becomes the second high-profile Democrat to announce their candidacy for 2020, following Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren’s campaign launch at the end of last year.Castro, whose grandmother came to the US from Mexico in the 1920s, will vie to become the party’s first Hiic-American nominee amid a field of that could swell to more than 20 candidates. The Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard also declared a bid on Friday.The father of two, who trained as a lawyer before entering politics, made a suite of campaign promises during his maiden speech. He vowed to introduce universal pre-kindergarten for American children by expanding a program he introduced as mayor of San Antonio. He also promised to bring the US back into the Paris climate change agreement with his first executive order and pledged comprehensive immigration and criminal justice reform. He named a number of unarmed black men and women killed by police in recent years, in impassioned support of the Black Lives Matter movement.Castro spent little time criticizing the Republican currently in the White House, but with reference to his recent visit to the border in south Texas, where he decried a “crisis”, Castro said: “Well, there is a crisis today – it’s a crisis of leadership. Donald Trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation.”Castro also pointed to the press risers and, in a marked contrast to Trump who frequently criticizes journalists at his rallies, thanked reporters for their work.“I know that the press work hard and that they are the friend of the truth in this country,” he said.Perhaps most pivotally, in the infancy of this Democratic primary, Castro came out in support of universal healthcare with reference to his own grandmother’s treatment for diabetes during her old age.“Thank God there was Medicare there for her,” he said. “Medicare should be there for everybody. It’s time for Medicare for all, universal healthcare for every single American.”The policy is likely to ide the field of prospective Democratic candidates, with moderates favouring less expansive reform. The candidate has also backed the progressive wing of the party by signaling support for higher tax rates on the super wealthy.Castro’s twin brother, the Texas congressman Joaquin Castro, spoke before his brother, acknowledging to the crowd of around 3,000 people who basked in the morning sun that his brother faced stiff competition.“I’ll be honest there will be a lot of great candidates in this campaign,” he said. “A lot of them are friends of ours.” He described his brother as“the best candidate with the best ideas and the best heart”.Castro was introduced to the stage at the Plaza Guadalupe amphitheater in west San Antonio by his mother, Rosie Castro, a famed civil rights activist from this city of 1.7m in south central Texas.“It is time to make sure that opportunity is made possible for every inidual in this country,” she said. “I want to introduce to you a son of San Antonio. A son of Texas. And a son of the West side. A son of this country.”Since his time in Obama’s cabinet, Castro has slipped away from the limelight as a new crop of young Democrats, including the California senator Kamala Harris and the former Texan congressman Beto O’Rourke, have gained notoriety. Harris and O’Rourke are also seriously considering presidential runs.Castro was vetted as a potential vice-presidential running mate to Hillary Clinton in 2016, but was overlooked as the Virginia senator Tim Kaine was given the role.Campaign volunteers said a few hundred people had been turned away at the gates of the event on Saturday, which drew a erse crowd. A mariachi band and local artists entertained the throngs before Castro appeared on stage.Brandy Sanchez, 40, had brought her four-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter to watch “history being made”.“It was so important for them to see this,” Sanchez said. “No matter what happens now he’s made his mark in history.”Within minutes of the campaign launch the Republican National Committee launched an online attack meme, attempting to discredit Castro’s time in federal and local office.The candidate will travel to events next week in Puerto Rico and New Hampshire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3565559d41f7b36a2e777a1a2e712bcbf5acd35d/1226_210_1909_1146/master/1909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c8dda47a6d9deb22a6a3ff35bc7b341","title":"rahaf al qunun lands in toronto after long journey to safety saudi teen canada","story":"Saudi teen was granted asylum by Canada after flying to Thailand to escape her familyThe Saudi woman who barricaded herself in a Thai hotel room in a desperate attempt to flee abuse landed in Canada on Saturday, capping a tumultuous and uncertain journey towards safety.Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun arrived in Toronto, the country’s largest city. As she entered the airport’s arrivals area, she was accompanied by Canada’s minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, who has been a vocal critic of Saudi Arabia’s jailing of female dissidents.“This is Rahaf al-Qunun, a very brave new Canadian,” Freeland told reporters, holding on to al-Qunun, who was wearing a “Canada” sweatshirt.The 18-year-old’s fight against deportation from Thailand as she tried to claim asylum captivated a global audience through her Twitter account, which had 157,000 followers as of Saturday.A number of countries had expressed interest in resettling al-Qunun, including Australia, which was her first choice – but it was Canada that acted quickly.“That is something that we are pleased to do because Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights, to stand up for women’s rights around the world,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Friday.The head of Canada’s United Nations refugee office, Jean-Nicolas Beuze, tweeted his thanks to the country for “having acted swiftly in providing a long-term solution”.“Women refugees at risk because of their gender are prioritised for resettlement \u0026amp we know they can count on Canada,” he wrote.Trudeau downplayed the symbolism of Canada’s offer to resettle the young woman Canada and Saudi Arabia have been at odds over the past year over the conservative kingdom’s human rights record.Last summer, a tweet in Arabic, sent by Global Affairs Canada, set off a diplomatic row between the two nations, in which Canadian diplomats were expelled from the kingdom, Saudi students in Canada were recalled and the Saudi government sold numerous Canadian equities and currency holdings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6dc6e8729f32e73af98f56e589ee0ff8ad2efc/0_36_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088a56079e6930f5128695b09647786f","title":"wendy searle anarctica race womens record south pole louis rudd","story":"When Louis Rudd crossed the finishing line of his 925-mile solo trek across Antarctica last month, the first person he contacted was Wendy Searle. “I’ve done it!!!!” the army captain texted her.It was the news that the 41-year-old Searle, a Ministry of Defence civil servant and Rudd’s expedition leader, had spent sleepless nights waiting for. “I’d known he was going to do it two or three days before but hearing he was there safely, that he had completed it as he’d set out to … I was elated. And completely relieved.”Next year Searle plans to be in the centre of Antarctica sending a similar message. She is planning to break the women’s world speed record for skiing solo to the south pole, unassisted and unaided, with Rudd as her expedition leader. “It will be a huge challenge but I think everyone’s got one big adventure in them.”Searle will need to ski 702 miles across the frozen continent in less than 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes. “I can’t have any outside assistance and I have to take everything with me in a special sledge called a pulk: all my food, my fuel, my supplies, everything. I can’t have any food resupplies or medical help. I cannot even accept a cup of tea,” she said. “I’ll be completely alone and, in all likelihood I won’t see anybody else.”Searle is 5ft 5in tall and weighs just over 60kg the pulk will weigh over 80kg. As training for the expedition, she is spending more than 10 hours a week lifting weights and running up and down hills pulling a tyre, while also holding down a full-time job in the Ministry of Defence press office.Knowing how difficult and dangerous the trip is going to be forces Searle to prioritise it. “When you know that, if you don’t do your training, one day that might be the difference between success and failure, then it’s a huge motivator.”Her family – her husband is a soldier and they have three teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son – are doing all they can to support her. “My children are super-independent, and they do a lot of managing upwards. They’ll say, ‘don’t forget parents evening and these are the appointments I’ve got you’. They’re amazing.” She is determined to show them that following your dreams is worth doing. “I want my children to think: if you pursue things with a passion, you will achieve the results you want to. I want them to see that it’s OK to pursue something with a white-hot passion in a single-minded way and focus on a goal.”Five years ago, Searle had never considered crossing the Antarctic. Then she managed the media campaign of an expedition to the south pole by a team of military personnel. “I became hooked.”She discovered the first woman hadn’t set foot on Antarctica until 1935, even though men had been going there for 100 years before that. It made her wonder if she could have a go herself. “Being around the pole community made it seem like a totally normal idea.”Despite the fact that she’d had no previous polar training and had never skied before, she successfully skied 350 miles across the Greenland ice sheet last year. “One thing I learned is that my polar expedition is going to be incredibly tough, mentally.”I definitely missed my children. But all I could think at the time was: no one day has been as bad or is ever going to be as bad as the six months I spent pretty much on my own in Germany when I was 25. My husband was away fighting in Iraq, I had a house, a dog and three children under four I was solely responsible for, and six months of just absolutely relentless grinding tiredness.As a woman, she faces certain physical challenges. “If you’re going for a pee in the Antarctic it is decidedly easier from a logistics point of view to be a guy. Periods are also a massive issue.” She will take medication to stop herself menstruating.Training for her adventures has changed who she is as a person. “Doing things that push me beyond what I thought I might be able to do, that has become a huge part of my life. I can’t imagine not doing those things now.” Searle is still raising money to fund the £50,000 expedition and hopes to raise a further £50,000 for charity. She says it is more difficult to attract sponsorship as a female polar explorer. “People need to get behind female adventurers. I asked a well-known TV agent why she doesn’t have more of us on her books and she said: ‘Honestly, there just isn’t the market for it.’ I’ve heard people in bookshops looking for adventure titles say: ‘Oh no, I don’t want to read anything by a woman.’”This kind of sexism is a vicious circle, she says. “If you’re not seeing women and mothers going on expeditions and doing amazing things, then how do you know women do that?” But they do, she says – she is part of a community of would-be female adventurers joining groups such as Adventure Queens or Love Her Wild.Searle hopes her story will change perceptions about who should be doing polar travel and is dismayed by the number of women she meets who tell her they could never do what she is doing. “They say that without even stopping to think about whether they could. I’ve got four kids and a full-time job. If I can do it, why can’t they?”But she adds: “I think there’s definitely a groundswell of women who want to go out and have adventures. They’re doing cool stuff, they just don’t shout about it. They don’t need that validation.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756302.1547315443!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"quidditch players gather in dublin for european broomstick event","story":"The Irish Quidditch Cup took place in Dublin and the winners of the Harry Potter inspired game would go on to represent Ireland in the Quidditch European Cup. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe second Irish Quidditch Cup took place in Dublin’s Trinity College with the winning team going on to represent Ireland in the European Quidditch Cup Division 2 2019 in PolandTwenty-five years ago the word quidditch barely existed in the English language. Today, not only is this term instantly-recognisable to legions of Harry Potter fans as the primary sport in J K Rowling’s wizarding world, but it has also evolved into a real-life, international sporting activity.Quidditch started out in the early 2000s as a sporting activity for American Potter-aficionados eager to recreate the magical broomstick competitions from their childhood tales. However, over the years the sport, which consists of athletes running around with a broom between their legs, has become a popular game among students and Potter enthusiasts alike.On Saturday morning, players from around Ireland gathered on the cricket pitch in Trinity College to hold the annual Irish Quidditch Cup to select a team to travel to Poland in April to take part in the European quidditch games.Philip Moore, a member of the Dublin Draíochta Dragons and head coach of the Irish national quidditch team, says the sport has continued to evolve since college students in the United States first began holding matches in 2005.“Every couple of years we have a new rule book because things change. The pitch used to be round like in the books but we’ve decided it’s more convenient to have it squared. Elements of the sport from the books are still here we still have bludgers and beaters and the golden snitch.”Mr Moore describes the game as a mix of handball, rugby and dodge ball, adding that it’s “very community orientated” and “extremely inclusive”. One of the primary rules states that a team – consisting of 21 players but with only seven allowed on the pitch at any one time – can only have four people of one gender playing during the match.“For people who are non-binary or agendered, however that person identifies themselves, they are marked down as that gender by the referee. It’s become very popular with the LGBTQ community because of this. It’s very rare that a trans person can play as a man or a woman, however they choose.”The International Quidditch Association describes the game as a mixed gender contact sport played by more than 500 teams in more than 26 countries worldwide. It says the sport seeks to improve gender education across sport while promoting equality, ersity, leadership and physical activity. In July 2017 the Irish national quidditch team participated in the European Quidditch Cup in Norway, joining teams from across Europe including Austria, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Turkey, Germany and the UK.Sebastian Steinke from Germany travelled to Dublin this weekend especially to take part in the Irish quidditch event. He first started playing the game because of his love of the Harry Potter books but quickly discovered a real appreciation for the wizarding sport. “It’s an intensive sport but very inclusive which is something I really like about,” Mr Steinke told The . “It doesn’t matter who you are or where you come from. It’s a sport for everyone and a very open-minded community.”Our daily offering of wacky news from around the world"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756279.1547309279!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald defends sinn f%C3%A9in attendance at maduro inauguration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaking in Dublin on Saturday Sinn Féin president Mary Lou  McDonald said many people would not endorse the leadership of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on the basis of poverty that they may be suffering. File photograph: John ThysAFPGetty ImagesSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has defended two senior party members attending the inauguration earlier this week of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. The party has been heavily criticised for sending MLA Conor Murphy and general secretary Dawn Doyle to the event as Mr Maduro’s re-election has been denounced at home and abroad.Ms McDonald said that Mr Maduro had been “democratically elected”and noted there were people in Ireland too who would not endorse the leadership of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. On Thursday Niall Collins, Fianna Fáil’s foreign affairs spokesman, said Sinn Féin’s presence at the inauguration was “just another example” of why the party is “unfit for government”.The vast majority of the opposition in Venezuela boycotted last year’s vote on the grounds that it was rigged in favour of Mr Maduro, noting a host of irregularities, including Socialist Party activists offering monetary payments to voters.However, he continues to enjoy support from the armed forces, leaving him with few serious challenges at home despite the international outcry.Speaking in Dublin on Saturday Ms McDonald said, “Yes, we had representatives in Venezuela for the inauguration of the democratically elected president. Politics increasingly is reflective of the fact that we live in a global village. We were there as part of a delegation, we were there because we were invited and I’m very glad that two Sinn Féin representatives were in attendance.“As to endorsing others, the important thing is that countries freely select their political leaderships and freely elect their governments and their government officials. “So it’s not for us to be endorsing or otherwise, we have our political work to do here. We present ourselves for election here to the people of Ireland,” she added.Mr Maduro replaced Hugo Chavez after his death in 2013 and won a six-year term last year despite hyperinflation, chronic food shortages and a severe economic contraction hitting the country. He blames an “economic war” led by the US and local opposition adversaries for the country’s woes.Ms McDonald said many people would not endorse the leadership of Mr Varadkar on the basis of poverty that they may be suffering.“You see there would be people who live in this country who would not endorse the leadership of Leo Varadkar on the basis that they endure poverty, some of them live in hotel rooms and many of them are only barely getting by on very low wages.“I think we also have to acknowledge that he is the Taoiseach and so I think there is a distinction between what people legitimately within their democracies might say or a view that they might have around a political leadership.“There’s a distinction between that and saying well that’s not legitimate,” she said.“We believe that the Venezuelan election was open and democratic and the president has been elected. Let me tell you this, it is for the people of Venezuela and for them alone to decide who their president is and who leads them and that’s our position. It’s the only democratic position you can have.”Ms McDonald said she was comparing Mr Varadkar and Mr Manduro “only in as much as elections and the selection of leaders and governments are for the population of the country concerned.”“So for us, you know, we decide and people go to the polls and they make their democratic selection and that’s as it should be across the world. That’s the only point I’m making.“I was answering the point of people having internal critics and experiencing poverty on the watch of any particular leader and I was simply making the point which I think is a truthful point that here in this democracy equally you would have people who are very critical of the government on the basis that they are experiencing poverty and that they are having a hard time.”Meanwhile Ms McDonald said she was “very concerned” at any suggestion that the fire at a disused hotel in Rooskey on the Leitrim-Roscommon border which was to open as a centre for asylum seekers had been started deliberately.“There was somebody in the hotel at the time. I understand that if fire had started later into the night that there could have been a very very tragic outcome,” she said.“It concerns me also any suggestion that people would act in a hostile manner in respect of new people, refugees coming to a community, and I say that very mindful of the fact that very often the State and the system can create some of these tensions within communities by not, you know, going down and talking to and collaborating with people who live in Rooskey or elsewhere.“There’s a way in a very, very compassionate and a very decent and a very friendly way that’s true to our Irish temperament to deal with these issues and to make a welcome to people who are vulnerable but it has to be done in a way in which communities feel included. That they don’t feel that they’re left on the outside and that no bad feeling is allowed to brew, but I await the investigation.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyWhat does a \u0026#39no-deal Brexit\u0026#39 mean - and how would it affect the daily life of Britons?Will Theresa May resign if she loses the Brexit vote?

The resurrection of Jesus ought not to be seen in physical terms, but as a new spiritual reality.”The bodily resurrection is one of the key elements of the Christian faithHe added how the disciples merely “felt his presence after his death” and the Gospel accounts in the Bible were not “historical records as we would write history today”.Senior Anglicans have rounded on his unorthodox views claiming they are inappropriate for someone who, as interim director of the Anglican Centre in Rome, will act as the de facto ambassador for Justin Welby, the Church of England, and other Anglican churches around the world. He will be central to discussions and meetings with Pope Francis.The Bishop of Maidstone, Reverend Rod Thomas, said believing in the literal resurrection of Jesus was a fundamental Christian belief.“The physical resurrection of Christ is part of Church of England doctrine and I joyfully proclaim it at every opportunity I can get,” he said.Reverend Dr Lee Gatiss, director of the church’s biggest evangelical group, said the situation was “utterly bizarre and absolutely inappropriate” and Dr Shepherd should resign.“If it is true that he does not believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus, then I don’t think he should have been ordained as a minister in the Anglican Communion in the first place,” he said.“The Bible is absolutely clear, as are the Anglican formularies, that Jesus died and rose again — it is the whole point and centre of our good news for the world.”He added that having a senior Anglican figure who does not believe in Jesus’s resurrection was akin to asking Nigel Farage to lead the Remain campaign.“He should stand down immediately or be replaced, for the honour and integrity of the Church of England,” he continued.Reverend Dr Ian Paul, a theologian and member of the General Synod, said Dr Shepherd’s view contradicted the Apostle’s Creed, an ancient statement of faith which unites all Christian denominations.“Is this really a good moment to appoint as Justin Welby’s envoy to Rome someone who doesn’t believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus?” he asked.Dr Shepherd’s appointment came after the previous ambassador, Archbishop Bernard Ntahoturi, stood down following accusations of sexual misconduct.Even though Dr Shepherd, who retired several years ago, is only a stop-gap his appointment is said to have been signed off personally by Archbishop Welby.Dr Stephen Platten, head of the governors of the Anglican Centre in Rome, told The   that Dr Shepherd, an extremely good theologian, had been in conversation with the Archbishop by phone before his appointment was agreed.A spokesperson for the Archbishop said interim appointments were made by the Centre in Rome and was unable to say whether the Archbishop approved the appointment or telephoned Dr Shepherd, adding that he was a priest of “good standing” and “due diligence” was used when appointing him to the temporary role.When asked if the Archbishop was comfortable with Dr Shepherd’s 2008 sermon, the spokesperson declined to comment.In a 2017 sermon, Archbishop Welby criticised those who “presumed to know better” than the disciples what happened after Jesus’s execution.Dr Shepherd did not respond to repeated requests for comment. His views about the resurrection are shared by a number of other Anglicans.Church of EnglandWhat does a \u0026#39no-deal Brexit\u0026#39 mean - and how would it affect the daily life of Britons?Will Theresa May resign if she loses the Brexit vote?

No one talked about football.Or, if they did, in England, they only made passing reference to the FA Cup matches. But, of the fervent attention normally devoted to the Premier League, there was not a mention.Saturday and Sunday were cup days. And without the Premier League, they felt quite flat as a result.It’s incredible, just how tight is the Premier League’s grip on the national psyche. From a standing start in 1992, it’s grown to become Britain’s most successful brand. You don’t believe me, you’re not that interested in football and you’re attributing my claim to the hyperbole that surrounds the elite of the beautiful game?Mahabis collapse should give other firms pause for thoughtA Populus poll found that far and away the most recognised British brand in the world was the Premier League. They tested 20,000 people in 20 countries with 10 of our best-known names – and the Premier League dominated, miles ahead of the likes of BBC, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar Land Rover, and yes, even the royal family.Hard to imagine, given the stacks of souvenirs for the House of Windsor on sale to tourists in the gift shops, the crowds that flock daily to stand and stare at Buckingham Palace, and the coverage heaped upon Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, but, overall, more folk worldwide are interested in the outcome of Man City v Liverpool.Remarkably, as well, reports GlobalWebIndex, the consumer profiling firm, a bigger proportion of the population watches Premier League matches on TV in Thailand, Egypt and Indonesia than in the UK. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University Business School, interviewed by Mat Snow for managmenttoday, the clever bit was in making the Premier League competitive.The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – ‘co-creation’ or ‘prosumption’ to use the vogue wordsAll the Premier League members have a share (the bottom three are replaced each year by the three coming up) and nobody has more muscle than others. This means that relative to rival leagues overseas, the difference in financial reward between top and bottom is actually fairly small (£150m to the champions Manchester City last season, £95m to bottom-placed West Brom). Because the playing field at least in this regard is reasonably level there is a chance, always, of an upset – that lesser clubs can afford to buy good players and give a decent account of themselves. They can, witness Leicester City, with a fair wind over an entire season, go on and win the thing.Of course, such largesse does not extend to the depth of the owner’s pocket or the strength of support and size of the stadium. So Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham enjoy the advantages of additional wealth and spending power. But at least where a share of the TV rights is concerned, the spoils are distributed more evenly.What every Premier League team needs in the January transfer windowIt’s this competitiveness that makes the Premier League so appealing. Says Chadwick: “On holiday in Sicily in 2012, a group of Swedish guys were watching Barcelona on TV. I was saying how wonderful they were to watch – Messi, Iniesta and so on – but they said, ‘No, this is terrible: it’s just pass, pass, pass. We like the Premier League – it’s fast and intense, a battle between big aggressive guys and quick, skilful little guys.’ It’s basic and primitive. Premier League football is about competing – to survive, to protect our identity, to ward off hostile forces.”What the Premier League\u0026nbsphas mastered also is the art of consumer involvement. Ironically, it’s the aspects that English football used to be so criticised for, says Chadwick, that have become its advantage. “I cannot advocate a sanitised, quiet, perfectly civilised afternoon, a tea party where we kick a ball around. A lot of the Premier League’s strengths, the speed of the game, the tribalism, the passion, are all caught up. If people were not irrationally involved it would not be the great league that it is.”The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – “co-creation” or “prosumption” to use the vogue words. Other corporates need to take a look at the Premier League’s success. It’s easy to mock the hype surrounding the league: the vast payments from TV and sponsors, the cost of tickets, the stars’ enormous earnings. But these, along with the breathless excitement of radio phone-ins, Match of the Day, and Sky, complete with its pioneering computer-generated graphics and Gary Neville’s technical analysis, all add up to a compelling package.Involving consumers, giving them a say, listening to them, explaining the product, taking it apart, inspiring loyalty, talking about it – these are all key ingredients in the enticing Premier League mix.The days when customers were encouraged to stay apart, to remain detached, and to take a back seat are long gone. Fans need, and want, to be engaged, to be asked about the business, to feel as though it belongs to them, that they somehow part-own it, and are responsible for its development and evolution.This means taking them with you, communicating to them treating them as equals, and not speaking down to them, not hiding or obfuscating. A tall order, but one that others have managed, not just the Premier League. Richard Branson steered Virgin to heights because he made passengers feel they were sharing in the airline’s journey.The Premier League is back this weekend. I can’t wait. See, that’s the effect it has\u0026nbspthat’s its achievement.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Forsman\u0026nbsphad been working as a photographer for a while, but\u0026nbspshe had only had a few stock images listed on Getty, one of the biggest stock photo agencies. In 2014 she learned\u0026nbspabout Stocksy,\u0026nbspa platform co-operative, which puts the photographer in charge of their own work.\u0026nbspWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK\u0027s social care crisisThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeThe sharing economy is failing because people can’t be trustedProfessional photographers find it much harder to make money out of stock photographs as smartphones and social media have opened up the field to amateurs. Many aspiring photographers now sell stock photos at a loss to try and make a name for themselves. Agencies have a steady flow of this under-priced content, making it harder to professionals, who are stuck in one-to-one relationships with little bargaining power, to command worthwhile fees.“Photographers can\u0027t act as a group for their interests against exploitative agencies,” Forsman says. “The co-op model makes the photographers organised as an agency, which means that there is nobody to exploit them.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMike Cook, acting chief executive of Stocksy, says putting the workers in control of the business was “a no-brainer”.“Why don’t all businesses work this way?” he says. Stocksy has high-standards for artists that means it can command higher fees, avoiding a race-to-the-bottom in the industry. At Stocksy, photographers get between 50 and 75 per cent of the proceeds when their stock photos are used, significantly higher than the 30 per cent or less offered by other agencies.Forsman says: “This makes it much easier for me to depend on stock for revenue, because the co-op does not exploit contributors but instead seeks to make their work financially sustainable.”Co-operatives have been around since the 19th Century, but technology has opened up new possibilities for how they are run. Next-generation platform co-ops, which bring together global communities of traders in an industry, have been seen as one answer to the problematic gig economy. They are an alternative to top-down platforms like Uber and Airbnb, where executives profit from gig workers who may lack the security of a proper contract and benefits like holiday and sick pay.Platform co-ops are growing in popularity in the UK. In December Equal Care Co-op, or Eccoo, started recruiting care workers in the Calder Valley for a new kind of social care, where those receiving and giving care are in charge of the business, including how much they work and for how long. Rather than changing a commission and extracting value from the workers and those receiving care, Eccoo provides a platform for workers and those receiving care to choose one another and gives them control over how how and for how long they are supported.Eccoo is offering a vital alternative to care agencies that pay minimum wage to employees who have little say over their hours and may be fired on a “one strike and you’re out” system. “The biggest issue for me was having the reassurance of getting enough work and having theright amount,” says Fran Watson, a founding member of equal care and an independent care worker. “I know of no independent care workers who do 15-minute slots. You just can’t do it. The options are either to go with an agency or go it alone.”Forsman, a London-based photographer (Courtesy Photo)In 2017, New Internationalist, a magazine dedicated to social justice and equality, raised £704,114 through community shares, offering its readers the chance to own the magazine in return for securing its future. The editorial staff are still hammering out the processes that readers will contribute to decisions at the magazine.\u0026nbsp“The feelings range from anxiety about what ceding control would look like to excitement about what that represents,” says Hazel Healy, an editor of New Internationalist. “I think it would be hugely beneficial to us and a great experiment to deepen the democracy further but it’s going to need to be cleverly done.”\u0026nbspNew Internationalist has been talking to Stocksy about proprietary software it uses to support decision-making among artists from all over the globe. When Mike Cook first joined Stocksy, the business was making decisions the old-fashioned way, by members submitting motions that were voted on at an annual general meeting.\u0026nbspThis model had its limitations for members that were based in different timezones and speaking different languages. So Stocksy created a system where a contributor can submit an idea, however vague, into a forum for discussion. Members are sent an email to vote if the idea should be advanced. When a minimum quorum of 10 per cent of members have voted yes to a proposal, it is advanced to the board where it can either be approved, or go to a vote.\u0026nbspThe system has already been used to give members the say on whether the membership cap at Stocksy should be lifted. Cook says the decision was one of the most contentious the co-operative had ever faced. “We have customers who love our content but tell us that we don’t have enough. We have worked with our members to create more content where we can, but we have a bell-curve of members, from stay-at-home parents who take photos part time, to full time photographers, make their living from stock.”The membership cap of 1000 artists was forcing Stocksy to prioritise more productive photographers. “It’s hard to say you must produce more or we cut you off,” Cook says. “This is what the cap was making us do, we realised when we got close to the cap we might have to replace some users with more productive ones.”\u0026nbspAt the same time, longstanding Stocksy contributors were worried that lifting the cap would “open the floodgates” of contributors, Cook says, watering down the agency’s reputation for quality. Sara Wager, a hobbiest astrophotographer who creates one or two images of the stars each month, joined Stocksy in 2017. She worried that lifting the cap might stop photographers with a smaller output from contributing. “I reached out to the Stocksy folk and they understood that I have niche images that can take many months to complete and so my uploads will be sporadic,” she says. “They really put my mind at rest that I was as valued a member as anyone else.”Sara was also able to participate in forums discussing lifting the cap. When the proposal was voted through, the board reached a compromise where members could vote to freeze membership each year, depending on how many contributors have been added. “This combination of informal talk, transparency and more formal processes of voting means that I feel a belonging and co-ownership to the co-op,” says Forsman.\u0026nbspStocksy, which employs 29 people at its base in British Columbia and several more in the US, sells photos to larger agencies, tech companies and other business. It had revenues of $10 million in 2018, making it much smaller than standard industry agencies like Getty and iStock. But its business model means that the photographers can command a fairer price than they might at much larger agencies. Cook says that while their decision-making processes might take longer, the transparent process means that photographers feel a sense of loyalty and community at Stocksy that is missing elsewhere.“I realise in the wrong company I’ll sound like a raving socialist,” Cook says. “But the reason we have a business is the contributors, so why shouldn’t they fairly profit from that? It’s not socialism, it’s fairness.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers at British universities found that 17 per cent fewer small packages of sugary confectionery were sold.Dr Jean Adams, from the Centre for Diet and Activity Research at the University of Cambridge, said: “It may seem obvious that removing unhealthy food options from the checkout would reduce the amount that people buy, but it is evidence such as this that helps build the case for government interventions to improve unhealthy behaviours.”Department of Health and Social Care.

It\u0027s shameful to validate them in this way.Right-wing extremists have always existed. Brexit is just an excuse - this is their real agenda.Pro-EU MP Luciana\u0026nbspBerger\u0026nbspaccused Mr Grayling of “cowering behind the small threat of far-right extremism” to avoid offering the public another referendum.The Labour MP, who has been subjected to relentless abuse and death threats, said: “These remarks are not only grossly irresponsible but also show just how desperate supporters of this proposed withdrawal agreement have become.“We absolutely need to heal isions in our society but we will not do so with a Brexit that makes us poorer and offers less control.“And the answer to a small band of far-right thugs roaming the streets must never be to capitulate and restrict our democratic engagement – it must be more democracy.”Labour veteran Roy\u0026nbspHattersley\u0026nbspdismissed the claims as “absurd”, adding: “I don’t think many people would regard Chris Grayling as an expert on these matters.”Lord\u0026nbspHattersley, a former Labour deputy leader who backs a Final Say referendum, told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme: “Nobody voted for Mrs May’s package. Nobody had the faintest idea what Mrs May’s package would be.“It’s only reasonable that now we do know what it amounts to, what leaving really means, that people have an opportunity to vote on that. It’s a different vote.”Lord Hattersley was due to address a People’s Vote rally in Sheffield on Saturday, along with Dame Margaret Beckett and Sir Vince Cable, but had to pull out due to illness.The row over the transport secretary’s comments comes after a week of heightened tensions in Westminster, when\u0026nbspBrexit secretary Stephen Barclay was condemned by MPs for saying\u0026nbspthe abuse hurled at MPs showed it would be too “isive” to stage another public vote.The Independent revealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And then, in the 2017 general election, 80 per cent\u0026nbspof you voted for MPs who stood on manifestos to respect that referendum result. You have delivered your instructions. Now it is our turn to deliver for you.“When you turned out to vote in the referendum, you did so because you wanted your voice to be heard.

We cannot – and must not – let you down.“Doing so would be a catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in our democracy.

Monday 21 could be parliament’s last chance to avoid the cliff edge. The decision on a people’s vote can’t be put off any longer.”Sarah Wollaston, a leading Tory Final Say supporter, said it was time for the prime minister to concede a fresh referendum on Brexit without delay.“Because parliament has reached an impasse, the right thing for her to do is say ‘parliament can’t decide, I’m going to take it to the people direct’,” she said.Created with Sketch.

It’s wake up time – we have a very short time in which to sort this out.”But Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out it did not have legal force, saying: “Parliament can pass motions saying the moon is made of green cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s legally binding.”A total of 17 Tory MPs rebelled, including Ken Clarke and Final Say supporters Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah, Jo Johnson, Philip Lee and Anna Soubry.The fresh setback for the prime minister came as she put herself on another collision course with Brussels, after toughening her stance on the Irish border backstop.The government accepted a backbench amendment that could give the Commons a veto over entry into the backstop – even though it would be legally bound to do so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement.Furthermore, if the backstop is implemented, the government would have “a duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements” with one year, so it “ceases to apply”.Both contradict the orce deal, under which the UK agreed the backstop was the default option if a trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 and that it should apply indefinitely.The move risked the EU’s wrath while being clearly designed to win over Tory MPs posed to vote down the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday.But it was immediately dismissed by one leading Brexiteer, former minister Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision.”Until the Grieve defeat, Ms May was only required, after losing on her deal, to make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.That subsequent motion was not expected to be amendable until Mr Grieve’s victory, last month, which meant MPs would be able to put forward their alternatives – but only for indicative votes.Before the defeat, Tory MPs raged at Mr Bercow for more than one hour, raising numerous points of order to vent their fury, in the closest the Commons comes to a riot.David Natzler, the Commons clerk and expert on parliamentary procedure, was believed to have advised Mr Bercow that the Grieve amendment should be struck out, because it clashed with standing orders.If the government does table the required motion within three working days, it could come very late on 21 January, postponing any debate until the following day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

He knows it is your final one and there won’t be any more forthcoming. But don’t worry. He has passed a motion. And the motion is clear. He completely rules out failing to do a deal with you.I have attended many boring political meetings and witnessed many fatuous ­political acts. Student meetings, tiny party branch meetings, national executive ­meetings of failing political parties, cabinet meetings of governments heading towards landslide defeats.And in all that time I have never ­participated in, indeed never witnessed, anything quite as fatuous or fruitless as voting to insist that we won’t leave the European Union without a deal. It’s not that I’m calm about the prospect of leaving without a deal. Or that I’m willing to support doing so.It’s just that not having a deal cannot be stopped by saying: “I’m against not having a deal”. It can only be stopped by ­agreeing to one.The Tory Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn joined ­forces on Tuesday to make it harder for the Government to let Britain leave the EU without a deal. Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not just Leavers. Most Remainers do too.They accepted their referendum defeat with a grace that would shame Tories like Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry, and most of Labour’s MPs,they had enough humility to feel it.Yesterday Bercow let the Commons vote, without debate, to force Theresa May to produce a Brexit “Plan B” in three working daysand when her deal is rejected next Tuesday. The aim is to swtly paint her into a ­corner from which her only escape is the second referendum Remainers optimistically believe would reverse Brexit.Bercow, supposedly the gatekeeper of our ancient Commons procedures, defied his officials’ advice and tore up the rule book to make this happen.Why  Because this supposedly unbiased Speaker deludes himself, like the Remain diehards whose dirty work he enables, that he is the dashing hero of a noble anti-Brexit ­insurgency .That’s right: the first “rebellion” to take back control for London’s rich, europhile establishment elite from a public that demanded change and was promised it by these very same politicians.Bercow has violated the impartiality of a historic office which he still holds solely because Remainers disgracefully ignored serious bullying allegations against him to secure his help.But equally dishonourable are those Tories whose weird religious devotion to the EU would now see them sacrice their own Prime Minister, Government, party and — more importantly — the ­stability of our democracy and country.The same goes for Corbyn’s MPs, who lie about honouring the Leave votes of millions of Labour supporters but would reject ANY deal Mrs May produced for one reason: it would mean leaving the EU.We hope the constituents this dismal rabble are busy betraying will make amends whenever an election is called.As for John “B****cks to Brexit” ­Bercow, his prejudices have skewed his judgment, fatally compromised his role, are directly hindering Brexit and have cost him the trust of half the Commons.Time’s up.A BOY of  butchered in the street. Parts of London looking like a Mexican drug-war zone. What’s the Mayor doing about it Or is he too busy banning fast food ads, blowing millions on fireworks promoting the EU or vacuously boasting “London Is Open”, asit would ever close PR opportunities are all that interest Sadiq Khan.

And they are cock-a-hoop, ready to reject Theresa May’s deal and enforce some even worse version, so absurdly soft as to be meaningless.It would be a near-perfect result for Remain diehards . . . a non-Brexit to suit the referendum’s losers while flicking a sneering, Geldof-style V-sign at the hapless .million winners they despise.Don’t like it  Suck it up, as Remainer Anna Soubry would say. But Leavers won’t. It’s too late for that. A supersoft Brexit will solve nothing.It will simply pour fuel on the flames — and finally flush the public’s faith in our Parliament and mainstream politicians down the sewer.NO wonder economic migrants chance their arm on a perilous and illegal dinghy voyage across the Channel when we are so woefully incompetent at kicking them back out.What is the point of our asylum process at allless than half those whose applications and appeals fail are sent home  Even the man previously running Home Office immigration enforcement knows it to be a shambolic disgrace.Some “refugees” now endure a -mile crossing from Belgium to Lincolnshire to dodge patrols.

But the remarkable thing about this row is that it will be based on the assumption that Theresa May has already lost this vote — and lost big.No one is pretending that May is going to win on ­Tuesday night. From No  to the Cabinet, everyone admits that it is lost. The optimists think the right amendments can keep the ­margin of defeat down to ­double digits, but that is as far as their expectations go.The row will be about what to do once the Government has lost. One faction in the Cabinet believes that, in the words of one secretary of state, “the only realistic route to go down is to force it into the EU’s hands”.This would involve devising a motion that made clear under what conditions Parliament would back the deal. Then saying to the EU: If you want to avoid No Deal, this is what we need to address.One Cabinet minister who supports this approach says: “They don’t have the agility or the time to construct that for Tuesday. But they should devise it for ten days’ time and bung it over to Europe.”But another group of Cabinet ministers thinks May can only pass a deal with “signicant Labour support” and so she should invite Jeremy ­Corbyn in for talks after defeat on Tuesday.One champion of this approach tells me: “If she does it well, she can make him take some responsibility.” This secretary of state ­concedes, though, that they don’t know whether May will do this or not, saying: “She is like a train on one track. She doesn’t know how to move.” So, what will Mrs May do Well, one of the few, who can claim to know her mind, tells me: “If the votes won’t come from the Tories, they have to come from Labour. What are the conditions for that going to be ”In other words, vote down this deal and Brexit only gets softer. No  is also deeply pessimistic about getting much more out of the EU than it is already doing. So, May is highly unlikely to go down the route of asking Parliament to show the EU what kind of deal it would agree to.At Cabinet this week, May tolerated some discussion of what would happen next. “No customs union, no second ­referendum. That’s the core for her,” reports one of those present. But will May hold the line on a customs union when that is Labour’s biggest single demand May’s deal is flawed. How could it not be, given the ­failure to prepare properly for No Deal, which has so weakened the UK’s negotiating position, and the loss of the Tory ­majority in Parliament which has hobbled Mrs May But the reality is thatthis deal doesn’t pass, Brexit will only be weakened. The Government doesn’t want No Deal and doesn’t think it could get it through this ­Parliament evenit did.That means it will soften the deal to try to get Commons support for it.The danger for Brexiteers is that voting against this deal could make it worse, not better.EVERY Tory MP needs to remember that a Jeremy Corbyn government would do huge damage to the United Kingdom.Privately, a growing number of Tory MPs who are passionately opposed to No Deal are flirting with the idea of bringing down the Government to stop it,necessary. This would make a Corbyn premiership almost inevitable.Now, No Deal would be disruptive and, given how late in the day the Government has left serious contingency planning, that disruption would be damaging to the UK and its reputation.But this pales into insignicance compared to what a Corbyn government would mean. Labour’s plan to make companies with more than  employees hand over ten per cent of their shares to their workers would do huge damage to the UK’s reputation for respecting property rights.It would contribute to massive capital flight from the UK and inflict lasting damage on the UK as a place in which to do business and invest.But the economic damage that a Corbyn government would do wouldn’t be the half of it. Would our closest allies, led by the United States, really carry on sharing the most sensitive intelligence with us with Corbyn in charge I doubt it. Once unwound, the level of security co-operation between Britain and the other members of the Five Eyes security group would be impossible to put back together.Risking Corbyn becoming PM because you are worried about No Deal is like amputating your leg to prevent your toes getting frostbite.So, let’s consider the events of the past week. The governing parties in Italy have sent messages of solidarity to the Yellow Vests in France, a group who want to remove the French President from office.Italy itself may well already be in recession and with industrial output falling sharply in Germany, even the powerhouse of the eurozone might be going that way.This is a reminder that it would be deeply ignorant to blame every bit of bad economic news on Brexit and that the EU’s problems have not gone away.AT a private meeting with Tory MPs on Wednesday night, Sajid Javid again made clear that he’s a very dferent Home Secretary from Theresa May.Talking about the rise in violent crime, Javid said: “Sadly, we’ve seen a drop in stop-and-search”, before talking about how its use was now increasing again.This was a clear attempt to distance himself from the Prime Minister. For who was more responsible than anyone  for the decline in use of stop-and-search, than the then Home Secretary Mrs May Javid’s comments will do little for the already badly strained relations between the Home Office and No .ORDER is close to breaking down completely in the Commons chamber.Tory MPs are so outraged by Speaker John Bercow’s behaviour that there is a real danger of them simply refusing to accept his authority.On Tuesday’s big vote, there will be a series of amendments – some of which will be designed to help the Government, others not.One influential member of the Government warns that “ he’s openly partisan in his amendment selections then I think there’ll be uproar and he could lose the House”.One secretary of state warns that in these circumstances you could have “ MPs stand up and completely disobey him”. If this happened, Bercow would either have to suspend the session or start chucking Tory MPs out of the chamber.Is it really feasible to have the Speaker eject scores of MPs ahead of one of the most important parliamentary votes in decades The flagrancy with which Bercow has changed the rules leaves him vulnerable to Tory MPs deciding that they, too, are going to flout convention and refuse to sit down when he tells them to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cave in to Remainers further, for example over a permanent customs union tying us to the EU forever, and the Government is kaput.The PM’s only solution after defeat on Tuesday is toimmediately to Brussels, preferably with DUP chief Arlene Foster, and tell the EU it’s now or never for a legally-binding assurance on the Irish backstop.It should be enough for the DUP and maybe Tory eurosceptics faced with the real threat of Brexit never happening.Here’s a stark reminder for delusional Cabinet europhiles:When they triggered Article  they voted for the possibility of No Deal, however unpalatable they now consider it. They also backed a binding referendum and a Tory manesto promising to leave the single market and customs union.And they should remember this: their own anti-Brexit prejudices do not matter a damn. What DOES is the Leave verdict of the .million majority and most Tory voters and members.If this Remainer-stuffed Government nullies or destroys Brexit they can kiss goodbye to their jobs and their party.They will have gted everything, our economy and our national security, to Corbyn’s anti-western Marxist rabble. Britain will never forgive them.OUR economy may be slowing a little . . . but the eurozone is in meltdown.Germany, its powerhouse, is close to recession.

because it would smooth the path and lessen the worry for those who do any form of business with the EU or are simply holidaymakers.Project Fear may not be true but it has made people fret, which is irresponsible on behalf of its progenitors and a pity for those affected.  More importantly, it is better for the UK to depart on friendly rather than hostile terms.Leaving the EU is not about dislike of our European neighbours, it is about escaping from a failed economic model and reasserting democratic control over the nation’s future.  It makes sense to depart in a way that maintains as much friendship as possible.Whatever happens, the European Union will remain an important economic partner and market on many international issues the UK and the EU will continue to have similar objectives and personal friendships and inter-connections will remain.  A deal would help ease all of this and even be worth making a modest payment for.This does not mean that the UK ought to fear leaving without the current Withdrawal Agreement or any potential alternative.  The recent Today Programme interview with Mr Puissesseau, the President of the Calais port and Deputy Mayor, removed the major plank of the Project Fear structure.Almost all the risks are predicated on the Dover–Calais route becoming gridlocked, stopping food, common medicines and components coming through although, the idea that just-in-time delivery requires the EU is ridiculous it is used in many non-EU countries across their international borders.  Mr Puissesseau said this will not happen.  He even complained that the preparations being made for it were disrespectful to Calais and that no extra delays would be imposed.  Amusingly, the interview was set up and introduced to provide the opposite answer and the tape is worth listening to for the discomfiture of the official BBC view.In addition to goods continuing to flow, under a No-Deal departure, the British taxpayer would save £billion, money that could be used to cut taxes, to help our domestic economy and leave plenty to help any exporters who face particularly high tarfs.The advantages of Brexit would come through sooner with trade barriers going down in  instead of , which could see the cost of food, clothing and footwear fall sharplythe Government were to follow sensible policies.  This particularly helps the least well off in society.Trade is helped by an absence of barriers, be they tarf or regulatory ones.  The EU specialises in erecting barriers for a fortress Europe.  Leaving without a trade deal under WTO rules would allow us to look to the rest of the world sooner and open up opportunities.  There really is nothing to fear but fear itself.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t want any written advice or advice of any kind at all.I’ve made my decision and I will stick to that.’”When the meeting broke up, the Speaker held the clerk back and he finally told him why he would be breaking centuries of precedent by allowing Tory rebel Dominic Grieve to table an amendment on a government motion.Another source said: “He tried more than once to explain why he was wrong but the Speaker told him he was not interested in what a gaggle of clerks had to say.“He finally managed to get part of his message across in private and handed over a note he had written from which he had quoted one or two points to help the Speaker deal with any questions he may get. But that note was taken away and destroyed.”Furious MPs have accused Mr Bercow of trying to scupper Brexit by allowing the controversial vote against the advice of his officials.He has turned down their requests to reveal the advice he was given by senior aides.One Tory said: “The question has to be asked why the Speaker will not publish the advice he received to when he ordered the Attorney General to make public the confidential advice he gave to the government on Brexit.”A spokesman for the Speaker’s office said: “Any meetings the Speaker has with the clerks are private and we never ulge what was discussed.”It also emerged that Mr Bercow secretly met Tory rebel Dominic Grieve a day before the Brexit rumpus.The pair spoke in the Speaker’s grace-and-favour Commons residence, sparking angry accusations of a “stitch up” over the extraordinary events.Mr Grieve refused to reveal what he had discussed with Mr Bercow but insisted: “Speakers make up their own minds.”We reveal today he binned a paper from his most senior official, David Natzler, when he tried to discuss Mr Bercow’s controversial Commons amendment.The Speaker shamelessly ignored the very Parliamentary conventions he is there to uphold so he could skew the Brexit debate in favour of Remainers — damaging the impartiality of his office.Mr Bercow has a B******s to Brexit sticker on the family car.Isn’t it time to say B******s to Bercow Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s my favourite.”Before going any further, it seems wise to make sure that our , aged six to nine, all know what Brexit is.Oliver Forster, also eight, from Houghton-le-Spring, Co Durham, says: “I think it’s something to do with what we’ve all had for our ­breakfast.”Seven-year-old James Eley, from Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, seems relieved by Oliver’s explanation, saying: “That’s good. I thought it sounded like a disease. It made me scared.“I didn’t know what everybody was being so serious about. So what’s a referendum then ”“It sounds like a Pokemon move,” says Cyrus confidently.Layla Thompson, eight, from Newton Ayclfe, Co Durham, adds: “It’s a football match between London and the rest of the country, I think.”Next, the kids are asked who is in charge of Brexit.When shown a picture of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Cyrus says: “I think he’s like a ­person from Harry Potter who’s just had a laughing spell put on him.”James adds: “He’s a scary old man,” while Oliver says: “I think he’s on ­Britain’s Got Talent.”Clover Cooper, six, from Darlington, suggests: “The TV ­sometimes has people at the bottom of the screen that do actions and he’s one of those.”The Prime Minister is a little more recognisable to the group, who are shown a video of her dancing on to the stage at the Tory Party conference last year.Cyrus says: “I have seen her on the news, it’s Theresa May. If she walked in right now I’d roast her because of her dance moves. She’d probably trip on the chairs.”Kaci Jo Bell, six, from Middlesbrough, adds: “She’s walking so funny, it looks like she’s about to fall over. Is she a clown  I think I’d get on with her.”When Marnie Harper, six, from Middlesbrough, is asked who her dream Prime Minister would be, she says: “My dad! He is my favourite person and he is bossy.”James ­suspects Donald Trump is at the heart of Brexit and says: “I think he’s in charge.“I’ve seen him on the news. He looks like he’s trying to be good but he’s naughty most of the time. Sometimes there are ­accidents. He doesn’t do them but other people ask himhe’s done it and he ­sometimes says yes and sometimes no.”Nine-year-old Ava Hancock, from Newton Ayclfe, says: “I thought he looked a bit orange.”Cyrus says: “When I saw Donald Trump on the news I thought about his wig and how it did not look like actual hair, even though he tried to make it look like hair.“Also, he looked like a chicken on an advert, you know, when they make a chicken nice and golden.”Next, the kids are asked who they’d like to take charge of Brexit.Clover says: “The giant from Jack And The Beanstalk, becauseanyone did do something wrong he would climb down the beanstalk and get them, so he’d be a really good Prime Minister.“Also Mr Tickle, as he has really stretchy arms and he could reach over the seathey did anything bad to us in Europe.”Kaci Jo has other ideas, saying: “I want the BFG [Big Friendly Giant, not to be confused with the ERG] in charge because he is big and he can just go and get them and shout at themthey do anything  wrong in Brussels.”This last comment baffles some of the others. “What’s Brussels ” two of them ask. Oliver reckons he knows. “It’s where Brussels sprouts for Christmas are made,” he says.Marnie is slightly off-target, saying: “Brussels  I think it’s in Germany.”Cyrus adds: “I think everybody there is green and eats sprouts and the fields are made of ­toothbrushes.”But the group seem less clued up about the signicance of March  — the day we are due to leave the EU. Looking confused, Clover asks: “Is it April Fool’s Day  Is it Easter ”James tries: “Is it a big day of ­celebrations ”Cyrus says: “It’s the day Brexit ends, I think. Then we won’t be able to go on holiday but we’ll still be able to go to Harry Potter World and Center Parcs.”Perhaps a little optimistically, ­Clover asks: “Will it be the day everyone starts smiling again ”Cyrus adds: “I think everything will be more expensive, except food that’s homegrown, because we can get that for free. All we have to do is get it ­delivered to the shops, then the shops will wash it and we’ll have food.“I’m going to plant some oranges and lemons.

But she has few left who would be willing to help.Her first call is likely to go to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to plead for a sweetener to boost support for her blueprint.But he is unlikely to give her any major concessions and has already warned the PM that he will not reopen negotiations — and that’s his final answer.Evenhe does agree to fresh talks, the countdown clock will not have stopped ticking and it is dficult to see what more she could squeeze out of the unyielding Eurocrat.Andshe ed from Brussels with nothing more than a few tweaks to the same old deal, the Pound would crash and there is a chance the public outcry would twist the arms of MPs to vote for the PM’s Brexit deal at the second attempt.Time is not on her side, however, and there will be pressure from some MPs to extend Article  — the two-year mechanism for leaving the EU — which ends on March .This is fraught with problems.First the UK would have to beg the EU for an extension and it could only be grantedall  member states agree.Secondly, the Government would have to change the definition of “exit day” in the Withdrawal Act, and MPs would get a vote on it.But reopening talks carries a high risk. President Emmanuel Macron would seize the chance to demand more fishing rights for France and Spanish leader Pedro Sanchez would press for more control of Gibraltar.Brexiteers would see it as a victory for Remainer MPs and the first step towards a second referendum — which would drag the country into the worst political turmoil for decades.A No source said: “If we had three more weeks, three months or even three years, it wouldn’t change the fundamentals.”And of course,the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, Mrs May would have to plump for one of the other options.But like every other way forward, MPs on all sides, from Brexit wreckers to hardline Leavers, will try to block her for their own political ends.Labour’s  MPs hold many of the cards and will make or break any effort by Parliament to drive the Government down one route or another.In the  weeks left until Britain leaves, Remainer MPs will try guerrilla tactics on an almost daily basis to try to thwart, delay or soften Brexit.And they will be the biggest stumbling blocksMrs May attempts to take us out without a deal.She has often insisted “No Deal is better than a bad deal” andnothing  happens the law is in place to dictate that Britain will leave on March . But Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, has admitted his top priority is to stop Britain “crashing out” of the EU.He says: “No Deal is not an option. Labour will not countenance No Deal and nor would many of the Prime Minister’s own MPs.”His stand would be backed by  Scottish Nationalist MPs,  Lib Dems and some Remainer Tories.Mrs May would also face Cabinet resignationsshe attempted to leave with no agreement.A senior Government source said: “There’s no way you can cruise control towards a No-Deal Brexit. That’s for the birds.”MPs unhappy with the prospect defeated the Government this week by voting to limit the Treasury’s ability to raise certain taxes, a symbolic warning shot across the Government bows.Their nuclear option would be to call a vote of no confidence.Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, two-thirds of MPs must back the vote to force a general election, which is extremely unlikely. If the PM loses narrowly, the Tories have  days to form an alternative government that is able to win a confidence vote —not there would be an election.But the timing is such that the earliest an election could be held would be February , barely five weeks before Brexit day.Mrs May could decide the best way to break the deadlock would be to “ask the audience” — by calling a general election herself.She would get to pick the date and fight it on the grounds of winning a clear mandate for delivering Brexit.But as she learned in , the outcome is not guaranteed. And with their seats at risk and a Marxist government led by Jeremy Corbyn waiting in the wings, they are unlikely to give her that two-thirds Commons majority she needs.Which perhaps explains why the PM is sticking so doggedly to her dodgy deal. She may be staring defeat in the face but it’s got as much chance as any of the other possible options.Andanyone  tells you they know the answer to the biggest question in politics, you know they’re lying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies.

The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence.

Cristina Calafateanu says she and husband Liviu suffered diarrhoea and severe stomach cramps just three days into their week-long stay in Egypt. When she ed to the UK she was diagnosed with bacterial infection shigella – before medics told her the illness had triggered a form of arthritis. Six months after their trip, Cristina, , says the agonising pain in her joints has left her still unable to get around unsupported.  She said: “I was stunned – no one should be faced with falling ill during their honeymoon.I can’t believe what’s happened, I feel I deserve answers – and justice –regarding how this illness developed. “Our honeymoon was meant to be memorable for very obvious reasons. “Now we’ll only remember it because of these problems.”  The couple wed in May last year and checked in to the all-inclusive five-star Baron Palace Sahl Hasheesh, in Hurghada, in July after booking through Thomas Cook. Within days, they say, both fell ill. Cristina, of Maidstone, Kent, said: “It was awful, we were both struggling for the rest of the holiday. “While Liviu slowly started to feel better, I still had incredibly painful stomach cramps. He had no option but to take me to AE when we got back.”  Doctors at Maidstone Hospital diagnosed infectious gastroenteritis. Tests later confirmed the cause was shigella, often passed on through poor food hygiene. But as she began to recover, Cristina developed horric joint pains. She was diagnosed with reactive arthritis, a known complication, and was readmitted to hospital for nine days as her mobility deteriorated.   Cristina said: “I was in absolute agony and could barely walk. When the doctors said my illness had caused arthritis I was in a state of disbelief. “I wasn’t able to climb the stairs, so Liviu brought my mattress down for me. I couldn’t stand, or walk anywhere – I felt like such a burden on him. “We had to buy my mother a plane ticket from Romania to come to England to look after me.” Cristina, who works in quality control, has since been unable toto work. She and Liviu, , who say they ate only at the hotel, have instructed law firm Irwin Mitchell’s to take up the case. Jatinder Paul, acting for the couple, said: “We’re very concerned. This is a truly shocking and upsetting incident. “What was meant to be a holiday of a letime became a nightmare. We are determined to help them gain answers.”  Thomas Cook, which operates the hotel along with other tour firms, said: “We’ve not received this claim yet but we’ll look into it with the hotel to make sure they are maintaining the high standards our customers expect.” In a separate case last year John Cooper, , and his we Susan, , died while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada. John, of Burnley, Lancs, was found dead in his room. Susan died in hospital six hours later. Thomas Cook, which operated the hotel, evacuated guests after tests showed high levels of E.coli and the staphylococcus bacteria.

Carl Austin-Behan and husband Simon are expecting a girl in March after conceiving with a lesbian couple who are also their close friends. The foursome have admitted its an unusual set-up but are thrilled they will be one big family with their daughter splitting her time between the two couples homes. Carl, former Mr Gay UK and the first openly gay Lord Mayor of Manchester, and partner Simon decided it would be the best option for them rather than going down the surrogacy route, or the mums conceiving via sperm donation. And, after several attempts with a home fertilisation kit, the foursome found out they were expecting a baby girl.  Carl and Simon both made sperm donations to be fertilised, meaning neither know who the biological father is. Legally, only two people can be named as parents on a birth certicate so one member of each couple will be named on the document. Carl, , admits its an unconventional family but says their little daughter will be cared for and showered with love like any other child in a happy home. “It is an unusual set-up, admitted Carl, who served as Lord Mayor between  and , and is now LGBT advisor to Andy Burnham. But everything is amicable and weve all agreed how we want it to work. “Simon and I are going to play as much a crucial part in the baby’s le as her mums are. Our baby will have two mummies and two daddies, and thats how we want it to be.  Carl and Simon, who have been together for  years, did start the adoption process but paused their application when Carl became Lord Mayor in . The couple eventually decided adoption wasnt for them and started to consider other options. The conversation with the now mums-to-be, who have asked not be named, came up at a friends wedding. The couples were friends of old and often socialised together. But they didnt consider shared parenthood seriously until the girls got married in . Carl said the couples had similar values and a shared vision of how they wanted to raise a child. We approached them about having a baby between us, and they were up for it, said Carl. It progressed into proper conversations about how we wanted it to work. We talked about having two mummies and two daddies, and the fact that we all have busy lives and that we all enjoy our lives. “But we didn’t think that that should stop us having a child. We know how we’re going into it and we’re all going to be responsible. “Everything is going to be split equally, so it’s dual parenting.”  A legal document has been drawn up as part of shared agreement between the couples should their situations change as their daughter grows up. You have to be very open and honest with each other, Carl added. “We’ve talked about her growing up, how much TV can she watch, how much time will she be allowed on the tablet, do we breastfeed, do we bottle feed. We’ve had all those discussions over the last  months. “We’ve done everything to make sure when she comes into this world she knows she’s loved by all four of us.” When the baby is born in March she will initially stay at the girls house in Salford. Carl and Simon will stay at the house too to allow them plenty of bonding time. The baby will start staying at Carl and Simons house in Didsbury when all four parents feel the timing is right. She’s going to have a bedroom at both houses, said Carl. As she grows up, she’ll have holidays with us and holidays with them. Weve got spare rooms set up at each other houses so we all have somewhere to stay.  Carl, who also runs his own cleaning business, has been a vocal LGBT rights campaigner for many years after being dismissed from the RAF for being gay. He hopes to broaden the conversation about LGBT parenthood by sharing his story. Like many people, Carl knew from a young age that he wanted children of his own. But growing up as a young gay man at a time when homophobia and discrimination were re, becoming a parent has not always seemed possible. “From an early age I have always wanted children, says Carl. To have someone that will carry your name and your legacy. That person will be your joy, your happiness, your love. “I’ve always thought it would be nice to have a child that is part of me, part of Simon and part of our family.”  He admits their family plans have been met with some scepticism along the way but Carl says hes happy to talk about it with anyone. “One of the things I’m really proud about is by doing this, having two mummies and two daddies, it could start the conversation or debate for other people who think ‘you know what, I could do that’. “We’re not doing it for the sake of doing it. The reason why I’m being so open about it is because I’m happy to have that dialogue and open debate. I’m happy for people to challenge me, to contest what we’re doing. At the same time, how can you contest giving love for a baby who’s going to be our daughter and a part of us  “I’m not saying she’s not going to be spoilt. She’s going to be part of a big family, and she’ll be very much loved. “It quite rare what we’re doing butit means someone stops me in the street to ask about it and wants to get more information, that’s only an advantage. That’s how we’ve moved on, by having conversations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fox tears apart kitchen family","story":"NewsFox tears apart kitchen of family home and leaves blood smeared on wallsBroken pots and shards of glass on the floor were among the debris after the rodent ran riot in a house in Ryde, Isle of WightShareCommentsByAmy Sharpe:,  JAN NewsThe fox had cut itself on broken glass after it ran amok \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBlood is smeared over the walls and floors.Broken pots and shards of glass litter the room.

According to a poll of , Americans and , Brits by YouGov , Americans are also not very clued up when it comes to Brits love passive aggressive statements. The poll analysing British subtext found that half of Americans wouldnt be able to tell that a British person is calling them an idiot. YouGov looked at a number of common British phrases, including with the greatest respect, I hear what you say, Ill bear it in mind and you must come for dinner, to Brits and Americans. The biggest dference in understanding was in the phrase with the greatest respect - which most Brits understood as I think you are an idiot, but nearly half of Americans interpreted as I am listening to you. While not all the phrases show a dference in transatlantic understanding, there are some statements where many Yanks are in danger of missing the serious passive aggression we Brits employ, YouGov said, BBC News reported. YouGov posted an infographic of the poll on Twitter , where reactions have been mixed. Some have pointed out that plenty of Brits dont understand the subtext of these phrases either, and others think its bulls*** to say Americans dont understand such phrases. Despite dferences in the polling, there was some common ground. For example, Brits and Americans alike understood I was a bit disappointed that as a way of saying I am annoyed that - rather than it doesnt really matter. According to the BBC, YouGov based its survey on a popular meme of British phrases and their subtext where what Brits say, what Brits mean, and what others understand are shown to be completely at odds.

Paul Burrell made the claim during a Amazon Prime documentary called The Diana Story, reports the Express. He describes how lucky the Duchess of Cambridge, , is compared to her mother-in-law who she never got to meet. Kate’s a very lucky woman because she has something which Diana never had, Paul said, adding that Kate has the love and support of theRoyal Family. With that strength behind her, she can go the distance. She can go all the way. She doesn’t need anything .  When referencing Princess Charlotte he also added: “Diana always wanted a girl.” Last month Paul defended Meghan Markle and offered her one piece of royal advice. In a Channel  documentary, Kate V Meghan: Princesses at War  he blasted Buckingham Palace as a minefield and Downton [Abbey] on speed. Among claims of a feud between the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge, the ex-aide said: Who would want to be a part of that family  He advised Meghan to stay close to Harry and get to know his granny - she’s the one that matters most.   Paul served as a footman for Queen Elizabeth II and was butler to Diana, Princess of Wales, before her death. He became a close confidante of the princess, who once described him as her rock. Comparing Meghans treatment to Dianas, Paul said: Meghan has married into the most traditional family in the country, the Royal Family. How is she going to cope  Princess Diana was brought up in a house that was as big as Buckingham Palace, and even she was lost.   Buckingham Palace is a minefield for any person going in there for a first time. He claimed Diana found it dficult to adjust as Buckingham Palace was not nice to her. He said: People set traps, they weren’t very kind to this young girl coming into this world. The documentary focuses on the alleged feud between Prince Harry and Prince Williams wives. But it also explores how the Duke of Sussex has allegedly changed since his marriage to the former actress.   Prince Harry is completely beguiled and enthralled to his pregnant we, according to Lady Colin Campbell. He reportedly told royal staff in the run up to their wedding: What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.

The highest risk of any snowstorms is from late January and into February as forecasters warn they cannot rule out a repeat of last years disruptive Beast from the East. Most of the country could see freezing temperatures and there are fears the brutal conditions could go on for weeks,disrupt travel and pose a danger to le. Some forecasts claim up to six inches of snow could fall in parts of the UK by the end of the month, with many places seeing at least a covering.   The latest weather maps offer a glimpse into where snow could fall from late next week, although there is still some uncertainty because it is still days away. In the short-term, Saturday through Wednesday will be mostly cloudy, windy and mild with some rain at times. Things will then turn colder, increasing the risk of snow, ice and severe frost. Blustery, wintry showers are expected in north-eastern areas on Thursday, followed by gales on Friday, when parts of northern Scotland could see snow.  From then on, the rain could turn to snow almost anywhere, but particularly across northern and central areas, especially later in the period between Thursday  January and Saturday  january. The east could see snow showers during that period. The latest maps suggest snowfall along western parts of the UK in the early hours of Monday  January before spreading east. Snow could fall across a vast swathe of the UK on Tuesday  January, with coastal areas under threat on Wednesday  January.   About -cm of snow is possible across East Anglia, the Midlands and as far south as parts of Greater London and Kent by January . Maps suggest heavy snow could continue in eastern, central and southern areas on Thursday  January, with sporadic snowfall over the following days until another system hits. Long-term forecasts are predicting another bout of heavy snow from Saturday  January to Monday  January, with the worst of it expected in northern Scotland. Over the snowy period, some places in the Lake District in northern England could see up to six inchesof snow while Yorkshire could be hit by about . inchesand North Wales could see up to two inches , the Express reported.  Snow is also possible in parts of Cornwall and Devon, and Northern Ireland from late next week. In its latest long-term update, the Met Office said there are signs that colder winter weather, resulting from a sudden stratospheric warming, is on the way for the UK.It has warned of snow, ice and widespread frost.The warming started around December  and winds about  miles above the North Pole reversed form westerly to easterly around New Years Day, it said. As a result of the sudden warming, the Met Office said, the main stratospheric polar vortex has split and been displaced across the Atlantic and Europe - a type of pattern normally seen in the spring.Unlike the ‘Beast from the East’ last year, this event is burrowing down through the atmosphere relatively slowly, the Met Office said. Deputy Chief Meteorologist, Martin Young said: “The latest forecast suggests the highest risk of any severe wintry weather is from late January and into February. Whether cold spells will be brought about by Arctic air arriving from the north or easterly flows arriving from the continent remains uncertain.“However, before this happens we expect a rather changeable and relatively mild spell over the weekend and early next week, with some rain for most of us. “From the middle of next week, and especially during the last week of January and into early February, there is an increased likelihood of cold weather becoming established across all of the UK.This would bring an enhanced risk of snow and widespread frost almost anywhere across the UK, but particularly across northern parts.However, the cold weather may not affect the whole of the UK and it is still possible that some milder and wetter interludes will intersperse this generally cold period, especially in the south.Britons have been given an early warning after research found two-thirds have been caught out by severe weather.  The threat was announced as continental Europe is hammered by relentless snowstorms that have killed upwards of  people so far and spawned devastating avalanches. The Met Offices outlook for Wednesday  January to Friday  January reads:Cloudy skies and a spell of rain will slowly edge southeastwards on Wednesday, clearing most places by the end of the day. Behind this it will turn clearer and colder from the north by Thursday, with scattered blustery showers, becoming wintry across northern areas. Winds will be strong with a risk of gales in the north at times. Thereafter, it looks set to remain mainly cold, unsettled and sometimes windy, with any milder spells tending to be brief and associated with longer spells of rain. The rain could turn to snow almost anywhere, but particularly across northern and central areas, especially later in this period. Some drier, brighter, quieter spells are likely, perhaps with snow showers, especially in the east. During such spells, frost could become widespread and severe. In its long-term forecast for late January and early February, the Met Office has warned of cold weather, including snow, ice and widespread frost. This is the outlook for Saturday  January Saturday  February: During the last week of January and into early February, there is an increased likelihood of cold weather being established across all of the UK. This would bring a greater risk of snow, ice and widespread frost, particularly across northern parts of the country. However, there remains uncertainty over the extent of the cold weather and how long it will last, and it is still possible that some milder and wetter interludes will intersperse this generally cold period, especially in the south.

A new dog food made from bugs instead of cows and chicken looks ready to revolutionise the industry. And as pets are responsible for shychomping one fth of the world’s meat and fish, it could help the planet too. TV vet Rory Cowlam from CBBC’s Pets Factor with Stacey Dooley, said: “As a conservationist and dog lover I am incredibly excited by the enormous potential for a dog food to reduce our pets’ collective carbon pawprint.” A food called Yora is made from creepy crawlies plus British oats, shypotato and beetroot. It tastes just like shykibble –the dry mix made into pellets for dog and cats to enjoy. Insects are unbelievably nutritious, packed with essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids. And they are easier to digest than shychicken. Traditional meat farming is said to be a leading cause of global warming but bugs use a fraction of the resources. Yora’s grubs, reared in an shypoundmillion facility in Holland, even munch shyrecycled vegetable shymatter that would otherwise go to waste. Two billion people eat insects and the trend is expected to grow.   TV adventurer Bear Grylls has launched an insect protein bar packed with worms. Some trendy restaurants have beetles and crickets on the menu. Yora founder Tom Neish said: “Animals and humans have been eating insects since the dawn of time. We believe we are the future of pet food. “We have trialled  recipes to find the perfect combination. “Yora lets dog owners take the lead in giving their dog a nutritious, tasty food while having a positive impact on the environment.” Nigel Baker, chief executive of the Pet Industry Federation, added: “With increasing pressure on all of us to shyreduce meat intake, it’s clear the pet industry will need to shyersy. We welcome this innovative product.” Yora, which is hypoallergenic and free of growth hormones, costs pound. for a .kg bag at yorapetfoods.

Kelly Field helped writers and shyproducers develop Sheridan’s shycharacter in the ITV drama, which started on Wednesday night. Viewers saw cleaner Sam, played by Sheridan, , bet at online casinos while struggling with a messy break-up, looking after two kids and her zero-hours contract job. Her story echoes that of mum-of-one Kelly, who had a flutter to escape her own stress, after a grievance at her former job in a residential care home led to a period of sickness.  Five years into recovery, Kelly, , is delighted Sheridan is helping shyhighlight the issue of female gambling addiction. And she has hit out at the glossy celebrity-endorsed ads used to attract women. She said: “I almost lost my le to my gambling addiction. At its height, it left me feeling suicidal. I wanted to drive my car into a tree and end it all. It was the only way out I could see. “I was so addicted to playing online fruit machines and bingo I wouldn’t eat, I wouldn’t drink. I would even take my laptop to the toilet with me so I could keep on spinning. “I hit rock bottom after blowing a pound, overdraft in under an hour. I was already thousands of pounds in debt and the frustration, anger, upset and shame overwhelmed me.  “I snapped up the bank card and started scratching away at my wrists with it. The emotions all came to the surface and I just crumbled. “I was self-harming with the card I’d just used to get myself further into debt. I was at rock bottom of a very steep spiral and I wanted out. “Luckily I was able to find the help I needed, but many don’t. “Gambling kills. I know of people who have taken their own le when they couldn’t see any other way out.” With debt collectors at her door, Sheridan’s character turns to illegal insider trading to try to win back the money she’s lost to gambling. Kelly said: “I funded my addiction by taking out credit card after credit card and maxing them all out. I got overdrafts and spent all our savings. “But people do turn to criminality. I see it all the time. “You’re so stuck in the debt and so filled with shame, you feel you can’t speak to anyone or tell anyone. “You can see why lots of people decide suicide is the best option. “When you’re in that state of shyabsolute turmoil you just can’t see how you’ll ever get help and break the shyvicious cycle.” Kelly, a waitress from St Helens, Merseyside, first logged on to an shyonline casino when she was off work with stress in .  She saw an advert for online bingo while watching TV and, after a friend told her about a dferent online shycasino, decided to give it a go. She said: “It was fun at first, and a great escape from the reality of what was going on around me. “It wasn’t about money or winning. If you do win, it feels good, so you go back on. It’s the buzz and the thrill and the bright lights, the music and the fast spin of the slots.” Despite hearing of others who had got into debt playing online casinos and bingo, Kelly thought her new hobby was just harmless fun. But she was soon addicted and hiding her habit from her partner, son and everyone around her. She said: “There are chatrooms on the sites. A message popped up from one player which read, ‘I can’t believe I’m pound, in debt.’ I was reading it, thinking, ‘How on earth do you get  grand in debt doing this ’ “But it quickly takes hold. Not even six months after my first spin I was pound, in debt and had maxed out my first credit card. Looking back, I can’t believe my bank let me keep going. “I was playing for eight hours a day, every day – hiding it from everyone – and could easily lose pound in just five seconds. It only takes a second to click, spin and lose it. “It doesn’t feel like real money. It felt like playing Sonic the Hedgehog when I was a kid, with the lives and top score at the top of the screen. “I would be losing more than pound every day, easily – sometimes more.  “I’d get up in a morning and, as soon as my partner went to work and my son went to school I’d sit all day on my laptop just spinning on the fruit machines. “I’d max out one card, then I’d apply for another one. Then another. I got so desperate I used to get into my car and think, ‘I’ll wrap myself around a tree and end it. Then it’s only me and the tree who would get hurt.’” Kelly eventually told her shypartner and found the help she needed. Since , she has been paying back her debt at pound a month and has helped other addicts recover. She said: “For someone like Sheridan Smith to portray what I’ve been through and for it to be seen on shytelevision is a huge deal. It will reach millions. She is such an icon.” Speaking about online gambling sites, Sheridan said: “A lot of gambling adverts are aimed at females in the daytime. They are pink and glossy.” Kelly agrees. She said: “I hate the adverts featuring trusted celebrities like Paddy McGuinness, who does Jackpotjoy, or the Gala Bingo one with The Chasers from the quiz show. “Plus the Tombola one, which makes it look like everyone is happy and having a nice time on a farm, drinking tea and shyeating cake. “The reality is people are sitting at home, alone, losing their money and sometimes their le to gambling.” For confidential support the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock  days a year on  .

As a result of Sabine McNeills abuse, children were forced to carry tracking devices or stay away from their homes for fear of being attacked, a judge revealed. McNeill, , harassed four mums - who cannot be named for legal reasons - claiming they were members of a cult who cooked babies and ate them. She wept as she was branded a malicious, evil and manipulative woman in court. She led a campaign to uncover claims of devil worship and child abuse at a primary school in Hampstead, northwest London. She made a series of baseless allegations against the innocent parents, sparking a police enquiry, Southwark Crown Court heard. McNeill was convicted by a jury of four counts of harassment and six counts of breaching a restraining order. Judge Sally Cahill, QC, told the weeping pensioner: This case has to be one of the most serious cases of stalking and breach of a restraining order that there can be. The direct consequences of your actions, is that for the four families concerned you have ruined all normal family le. Their children have been unable to attend school normally, and are either home schooled or have to carry tracking devices and alarms.   The families have escape routes planed in case of attack, mothers have slept on the floors of their childrens bedrooms to protect them. They have had to move home they have had businesses ruined as a result of being unable to have an online profile. Asthat is not bad enough, for the children they will never, as things stand at the moment, be able to go online and put in their own names without seeing the vile filth that you have peddled over a period of years. The allegations were of murder, cannibalism, satanism and sexual abuse. They could not be more serious or vile. The childrens lives have been blighted forever. In my judgement you are an arrogant, malicious, evil and manipulative woman. One of her victims told how her le had been affected by the claims in a statement read out in court. The family have been forced to change their childs name and carry out what police call special measures, changing their route to school and practicing panic drills. The mother said McNeills campaign of abuse has affected every part of her le. She said she is unable to concentrate at work and her marriage has come under strain. I now feel like Im failing on every level, as a mother, we and worker, she said. To this day my daughter is fearful and worries that our family will be attacked in our home - my husband keeps a crowbar under our bed. She struggles to understand why adults post material of a sexual nature about her online for the world to see. My daughter has had to assume an alternative name in certain aspects of her le, which is something that no child should have to do. We may have to consider fully changing our daughters name by deed poll. She may have to live with the stigma of being branded a satanic sexual abuse victim for the rest of her le. I cant tell you how it breaks my heart, told the, at times, visibly upset mother. Our family was placed under special measures by the police.   Miranda Moore, prosecuting, said McNeill repeatedly harassed her victims from  until earlier this year. She said: This relates to four totally innocent women who have had their lives turned completely upside down by this defendant. McNeill published scandalous satanic child abuse accusations and encouraged people to take direct action against the children of these women. According to McNeill they would drink the blood of babies and then dance around wearing the skulls on parts of their bodies. They would put them to sleep by injecting them, slit their throats, cook the babies and eat them. The ritual is performed on an upstairs room in McDonalds on Mondays and Fridays. Sacrice, blood drinking and babies flesh eating occurs on Saturdays. The children are frequently injected and put to sleep, apparently the school nurse is the one who does the injections. McNeill claimed up to  teachers from the primary school were also involved in abusing children. She said members of the cult - from all walks of society - carried out satanic rituals in secret rooms at a Hampstead church. Referring to McNeills claims, the prosecutor said: There is someone who works in Costa Coffee, a solicitor, someone who works in Waitrose, people who work in Hampstead police station, then we have got people from the Royal Free Hospital, social services and finishing up with people from the Brownies. Ms Moore told the court: In September  the politan Police received reports of wide spread child abuse. Satanic child rape and murder in churches in Hampstead in north London. These allegations surround two small children, commonly referred to as P and Q. She said police initially took the complaints seriously and interviewed the children. The matter eventually reached the High Court and Mrs Justice Pauffley ruled that the accusations relating to the cult were baseless. But recordings of the childrens police interviews surfaced online and McNeill began her campaign to uncover the alleged cult, said Ms Moore. All of this is completely fake and as a result of Ms McNeills activities, these woman have had to change their lives drastically - they have had to take their children out of school, they have had to protect their children. Jurors heard one parent was forced to install a panic alarm and another was approached by a paedophile online looking to sleep with her child, making her physically sick. Describing how McNeill directed the campaign, Ms Moore added: She said online that members of the public should paint dolls of the Barbie iety with red nail polish and send them to business owners in the Hampstead area. McNeill was involved in a protest at the church in March  and subsequently arrested. She was later cleared of plotting to intimidate a vicar and his parishioners after a trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, but handed a retraining order to stop her harassing the parents involved. Having been told not to publish these  allegations, particularly about the school and the church, and having been before the courts on a few occasions she changes method, said Ms Moore. She goes to what I will call the analogue method - she attends the General Synod who were having a meeting to deal with the Church of Englands approach to child abuse. She attends the meeting and gives out leaflets. Ms McNeill was again arrested for doing that. She is an online troll of the worst kind, making the lives of innocent families a misery. McNeill, of Goldhurst Terrace, Camden, was convicted of four counts of harassment and six counts of breaching a restraining order. She was cleared of  further charges of breaching a restraining order. McNeill was jailed for a total of nine years.

The same weather warnings and patterns from last year have been spotted again this month, with the Met Office saying it could prompt another icy Siberian blast.

Winds will ease on Monday, with mostly cloudy skies and patchy rain into Tuesday. However, as night falls temperatures will drop and rain will be seen across most of the UK except for the east of the country.  The Met Office confirmed that by the middle of January rain could turn to snow almost anywhere, but particularly across northern and central areas especially towards the end of the month. The forecast continued: Some drier, brighter spells are likely, perhaps with snow showers, especially in the east. During such spells, frost could become widespread and severe. During the last week of January and into early February, there is an increased likelihood of cold weather being established across all of the UK, with temperatures continuing a downward trend to become cold or very cold. This would bring a greater risk of snow, ice and widespread frost, particularly across northern parts of the country. However, there remains uncertainty over the extent of the cold weather and how long it will last, and it is still possible that some milder and wetter interludes will intersperse this generally cold period, especially in the south.

After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c386996996ee2.68324658.jpg ","title":"dundee charity shop selling clothes designed by oasis star liam gallagher","story":"A Dundee charity shop is setting up a Wonderwall of jackets after receiving a delivery of Liam Gallagher-designed clothing.Budding Rock ‘n’ Roll Stars will need to make their way to Shelter on Perth Road at Supersonic speed after the shop was gted half a dozen mint-condition Pretty Green coats and jackets.The generous donation was handed in to the store by an anonymous donor.The jackets usually retail at between £-£ and will help raise much-needed funds for the homeless charity.The clothes are expected to sell quickly, due to their Oasis connection and affordability.John Sinclair, Shelter Scotland area manager, said: “We are really grateful to the person who has donated these high-quality items which are in perfect condition.

He said: “I was talking to my dadand my brothers about the last year when I went home last week.“We were saying what an incredible time it has been because this time last year I was playing Under- football at Hamilton.“I hadn’t even kicked a ball at senior level.“It is a bit incredible and I feel asI have been playing for longer than a year.“I have really enjoyed it and it has went in so quickly and I would not have it any other way.“I never really thought about it because when I was at Hamilton and the Us, the target was to play for the first team and I managed to do that.“I kicked on and played well and when I came here to Aberdeen it was the same objective, just to get into that starting .“From there I have kicked on and never looked back.”Aberdeen were ordered by an SPFL tribunal to pay Hamilton around £, in development compensation in August.The Reds initially offered £, but Hamilton wanted as much as £.m.With the sides unable to meet a compromise the matter went to the tribunal.Already, £, for a player of Ferguson’s talent, poise, maturity and potential is the deal of the season.Ferguson has started every game he has been fit for and only missed the - win at Livingston in the final match before the winter shutdown through suspension.After a congested December that moved Aberdeen to within three points of Premiership leaders Celtic, Ferguson was grateful for a week in Dubai.He said: “We had nine games in December and I played in eight of them.“The only game I didn’t play in was Livingston where I was suspended.“I played for  minutes in all the games before that and it is tough on the legs as there was a game every three to four days.“It was a hard period but you just have to get through it to pick up as many points as possible.“I had a wee break before Dubai as I went out to Tenere for New Year. Then it was back here to start the hard work again.”Dons boss McInnes has been putting the -man squad through double sessions at their training camp in  to  degree heat.However, it is not all graft as there has been some down time with Ferguson and some other Dons going to a water park out here.Those Dons who did not want to cascade down flumes opted to play on the Jebel Ali Beach Hotel’s nine-hole golf course.Ferguson said: “Being out in Dubai for training is great as the pitches are a dferent class and so is the weather.“Being out here also gets all the boys together and it really helps the side.“There are no distractions here as the boys get away from everything.“We can come here and relax.“We went to the water park which was a good laugh and fun, although we do all the hard work as well.“I am rubbish at golf so I left that to all the other boys and went to the water park instead.”To hear Ferguson talk about water park is a reminder he is still a teenager.He plays with the maturity and intelligence of a pro with many years top experience, but he is still only  years old.“There is hard work though as we are doing morning and evening sessions out here so it is tough,” he said.“However, this is a great place to come out to and do that hard work.“The weather and facilities makes it better than being back in Scotland when it is freezing and windy.“When you are in the sun and in surroundings like this doing that hard work is more enjoyable.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/SNS-18311586-ABERDEEN.jpg ","title":"mcinnes keen to ramp up fergie deal discussions","story":"Dons boss Derek McInnes today confirmed he wants to secure midfielder Lewis Ferguson on an extended contract.The -year-old revealed to the Evening Express in Dubai he would be happy to sign an extension to his deal, which runs until summer .Following Ferguson’s openness about extending his contract McInnes will look to step up talks when the Donsfrom the United Arab Emirates next week.McInnes said: “I spoke with Lewis and his agent at the start of December and said we would maybe catch up when we come back after the winter break.“Lewis has been terric and his level of performance for someone so young has been great.“He has dealt with absolutely everything that has come his way.“It is a bit like Sam Cosgrove where we rewarded him with a new contract in recognition of his performances.“We would want to do something similar with Lewis.“He is certainly deserving of that andit is something he is open to, then great.”Striker Cosgrove, who was awarded the Premiership Player of the Month for December out here in Dubai, recently signed a contract extension until summer .Following the emergence of Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna, the Dons also quickly tied him to an extended deal until the end of the   campaign.Those new deals, and McKenna’s superb form, rocketed his value with Aberdeen rejecting bids of £ million from Aston Villa and £.m from Celtic for the -year-old last summer.McInnes recently admitted it would be naive not to expect more interest, and potentially bids, for McKenna in the January transfer window.The Dons boss reckons McKenna will ultimately move to the English Premier League but hopes to retain the Scotland international until at least the end of this season.He insists Ferguson and McKenna are very similar in their refreshing attitude, which is solely football focused and rejects any of the trappings that come with being a pro footballer at a top club.McInnes said: “Lewis is very similar in terms of his traits to Scott McKenna. Both are very mature, very understated and go about their business very quietly.“Both have a high level of performance, are highly motivated and have bags of determination.“Neither of them are interested in ego or all the trappings of being a footballer.“They both just get on with the job, which is really refreshing.“Although they are in dferent positions, Lewis and Scott have a similar mindset and outlook.“They both have that assurance about themselves. You see that in them.“They are very similar in terms of their outlook on their career.”A fundamental trait with both Ferguson and McKenna is that when they got their Aberdeen chance, they grabbed it.McKenna received his breakthrough in a - Scottish Cup tie win at Motherwell in September .At the end of that debut season McKenna was leading out Scotland as captain for a - loss against Mexico at the Estadio Azteca.Likewise Ferguson impressed McInnes so much during the pre-season he handed him a debut start in the opening game of the season.He impressed in the Europa League second qualying round first leg tie at Pittodrie, a - draw.However, Ferguson really announced himself in theleg with an audacious overhead kick goal at Turf Moor.The teen also headed home the only goal in the - Betfred Cup semi-final defeat of Rangers at Hampden.McInnes said: “Lewis has scored key goals in big moments and his goal got us to a final.“He scored away in Burnley in the Europa League with an overhead kick.“Lewis also scored last minute winners against Kilmarnock and Livingston.“You are looking for someone to step up on these occasions and he has made a habit of doing that.“For Lewis and our other midfielders, the demands to score even more goals should be there.“The more winning goals he scores the better. Lewis is doing so well for someone so young.“The best thing you can say about Lewis is that it looks like he has been playing here for years.“It looks like he has about  games under his belt.“The fact he has only played about  games in his senior career is testament to him and how natural it is that he feels at home here.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinnes prioritises new deal for shinnie","story":"Dons boss Derek McInnes confirmed today he will use the remaining time in Dubai to try to convince skipper Graeme Shinnie to sign a new contract.Aberdeen jet back from the United Arab Emirates on Monday after a week-long winter training camp.McInnes hopes to be flying back to the Granite City with a positive answer as to the long-term future of his club captain.Shinnie is out of contract at the end of the season and has been free to talk to any interested parties from the start of the winter transfer window on January .English Championship clubs Brentford and Hull City are understood to be monitoring Shinnie’s situation with the view to launching future moves.McInnes has already offered the -year-old Scotland international a new, improved contract that would make him one of the highest-paid players at Pittodrie.He hopes fresh talks in Dubai can help persuade the midfielder to pen a new deal.McInnes said: “I will speak to Graeme when we are out here in Dubai and hopefully we can get the answer we all want.“But again I totally respect all my players who are out of contract in the summer.“They are quite right to look at all the options.“However, Shinnie is one that it is vitally important we try to keep.”Also out of contract in the summer is Scotland international winger Gary Mackay-Steven.The winger ed to training in the United Arab Emirates having been sidelined for almost six weeks.Mackay-Steven had been out with concussion having been knocked unconscious in a clash of heads in the - Betfred Cup final loss to Celtic on December .He missed all eight Premiership games in December.While out in Dubai the Dons received an e-mail from MLS side New York City confirming they wanted to speak to the winger’s representatives.On receipt of the e-mail the Dons immediately contacted Mackay-Steven’s agent to discuss the situation.New York City are managed by Domènec Torrent, who was assistant manager to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.Torrent took over at New York City in June this year, replacing former manager Patrick Vieira.Former World Cup winner David Villa, who won the Champions League with Barcelona, starred for New York City for four seasons until April last year.With the concrete interest from New York, McInnes accepts he faces a fight to keep Mackay-Steven.However, it is one he remains confident of winning.He said: “We got notication from New York City that they wanted to speak to Gary’s representatives, as is their right.“Gary was oblivious to it.“I spoke to him on the morning and he knew nothing about it.“When players get into this stage of their contract, you have got to accept you are in a fight to keep them.“We have been in a fight to get Gary and others to commit for a while now, but it is their right to let their contract run down and assess their options.“All we’ve asked Gary and his agent is ‘are we still in the running to keep you ’ and they said ‘absolutely’.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/SNS-18313644-ABERDEEN-114x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"vlog dons in dubai day one","story":"With Aberdeen#s training camp in Dubai under way, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent reflect on ing faces, an exit and the excellent facilities in the Middle East.Press and Journal sports writer Jamie and Evening Express chief football writer Sean will be sending video updates daily from the United Arab Emirates."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/DSC_1522-940x529.jpg ","title":"vlog dons in dubai the joy of football in the sun","story":"In the latest video blog from Dubai, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent discuss Aberdeen#s training session that was open to supporters.They discuss which players impressed in the session and how much meeting the players clearly meant to the fans.Sean and Jamie also talk about going to an Asian Cup group game in Dubai where Australia beat Palestine -."},{"url":null,"title":"charitys cash boost","story":"A north-east children’s charity has received a cash boost.The Archie Foundation received £,. from NorthLink Ferries, which was raised through ious fundraising efforts.NorthLink Ferries’ efforts included abseiling down the Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital and taking part in the Virtual Challenge trek.A statement made by the Archie Foundation said: “We were absolutely delighted to receive this amazing cheque from NorthLink Ferries.“ was a fantastic year working with Kathryn Fullerton and the crew.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr. The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-dance-school-opens-its-doors-to-the-public","story":"A PEEBLES dance school is opening its doors to the public this weekend.On Sunday, the Fiona Henderson School of Dance will welcome locals into its studio to find out more about upcoming classes.

independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Would he still be playinghe had not put his body through quite so much punishment Ivan Lendl, under whom Murray won all his biggest inidual titles, was the only coach able to consistently ramp up his chargersquos aggression, while tempering the Scotrsquos tendency to allow negativity to overwhelm him.It was no surprise Murray struggled to keep believing when always standing in his way were three of the all-time greats. Four times he lost in slam finals, twice to Djokovic and twice to Federer, before finally breaking his duck in appropriately gruelling fashion against Djokovic at the US Open in .The following summer came his career-defining moment when he ended Britainrsquos -year wait for a male singles champion at Wimbledon, adding a second title three years later then writing his own piece of history by becoming the first tennis player to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in singles.In the autumn of , with his rivals at last showing some weakness, Murray surged thrillingly to the top of the rankings, clinching the number one spot by winning the ATP Finals in London.What seemed like it might be the start of the Murray era turned out instead to be a glorious swansong. Barely six months later, the first signs of his hip problem emerged and, despite surgery and an extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning programme, there has been no way back to the top.Perhaps even more important than his achievements on the court, the understated Murray emerged as one of the sportrsquos great trend-setters.First there was Murrayrsquos realisation in his early twenties that, rather than just employing a coach, having a team of people around him would help him reach his peak physically and mentally.Then, with a grand slam title still tantalisingly elusive, he reached out to a former great in Lendl, establishing the trend of the super coach. When their partnership came to an end, Murray broke more ground by hiring Amelie Mauresmo, who became the most high-profile female coach in tennis.Most top sportsmen would rather not stick their head above the parapet but, once he became comfortable in the limelight, Murray swam against the tide, speaking out forcefully on issues like equality and doping.He also embraced his role as the figurehead of British tennis, actively supporting and encouraging those emerging in his wake.

Itrsquos on the wall of the community centre and itrsquos spelled out in letters of purple, blue and yellow. It says ldquoFeegie wummin are a breed o their ain. Laura Connor, who is a Feegie woman, takes me over to the poster and stands in front of it for a photograph. This is more like it, she says. A label to stick on top of the other one.Irsquom going to be talking more to Laura today, and Jamie, and other people about how you can start to change all of this and improve Ferguslie Park. The lessons come fast: names, words and descriptions matter the biggest impact of poverty is not financial, itrsquos psychological often, the best people to fix poverty are women, not men. And then therersquos this lesson: Scotland might be one of the richest countries in the world, but an idea from the one of poorest countries might have something important to teach us.The idea started in India and involves setting up groups of people to save small amounts of money each week. Self-reliant groups, as theyrsquore called, can give small loans to members in times of crisis the members also use the money to develop small businesses which can in time generate an income. The money saved each week could be as low as p, but the theory is thatyou get a lot of iniduals together, you can start to make a dference to a community.I saw the idea working for myself a few years ago when I was in Bangladesh. Travelling with Christian Aid, I went to the Gopalgonj district of the country and sat in on a meeting of a self-reliant group in one of the villages. Itrsquos hard to forget what the women said. One told me that when they were iniduals they were like single sticks that could break. ldquoBut when we are united, she said, ldquowe cannot break. Most of the women had set up little businesses selling handicrafts and it was starting to make a dference.But could the idea work here in Scotland, where the circumstances are dferent  Thatrsquos what Irsquom in Ferguslie Park to find out and Laura Connor is keen to tell me more about the small business shersquos started to sell home-made soaps. Laura, whorsquos , grew up in Cumbernauld but has lived in Ferguslie for  years. Shersquos sometimes struggled with self-confidence. She was born with a dislocated hip so has struggled with disability. Finding work has also not been easy. In recent years, shersquos applied for many, many jobs but has been unsuccessful. She says herself: ldquoI needed something in my le.Laurarsquos partner also does not work so money is tight. Laura has two sons, one four and one ten years old, and she often has to say no to them. One of them wanted a game the other day at pound., but Laura had to say he couldnrsquot have it. She has to budget to within an inch of her le to survive on the benefits she receives. ldquoMy oldest understands the situation, she says, ldquoHe will ask for stuff and try his luck but itrsquos about saying no, you canrsquot get that.Laura says the the self-reliant group to which she belongs has started to change that situation, albeit in a small way. She pays for the materials for her soaps by saving small amounts ndash the set-up cost was around pound ndash and has now sold some of them, through her Facebook page and events at the Tannahill community centre in Ferguslie. It all has to be balanced with her benefits as any earnings can have an effect on them, but the small amounts are making a dference ndash and not just financially.ldquoI was getting frustrated with le, says Laura. ldquoBut Irsquom happier now. Irsquom a person again. We all bounce off each other at the group. And we support each other. I had no confidence but Irsquove had a lot of support and I know theyrsquoll be there for me.What Laura says pretty much gets to the heart of the idea of self-reliant groups it also raises some surprising truths about poverty that donrsquot have much to do with money, although no one is denying the reality of the financial situation for many people in the area. Jamie Mallan, who works for Ferguslie Park Housing Association and the man who was warned about the area by the taxi driver, says the financial crash of ten years ago meant services simply disappeared from Ferguslie Park. Hersquos also very worried about the introduction of Universal Credit.ldquoWersquore hearing stories of single parents having their benefits cut, just chopped, he says. ldquoWersquore hearing stories of iniduals who have been unemployed and are going to have to wait four weeks for any payments. Wersquore hearing stories of children having their disability living allowance cut but their disability is still there. Irsquom really scared about the changes that are taking place.But Jamie, and others, say that itrsquos not all about money and that therersquos a big psychological and mental element to poverty. ldquoMillions upon millions of pounds has been pumped into Ferguslie Park to help regenerate it and develop it, says Jamie, ldquobut the issues we face are complex and constantly changing. The things that really make the area deprived are health and access to services. People donrsquot go to the doctor when they should. Le expectancy is much lower and as people get older they have more and more conditions. But I think part of it is the psyche, that for the past  years yoursquove been told yoursquore the most deprived community in Scotland. Why should you raise your expectations Professor John McKendrick of Glasgow Caledonian University, who is one of Scotlandrsquos leading authorities on poverty, agrees with this take on the subject, and thinks self-reliant groups can make a signicant contribution to tackling it.ldquoMost of your le is not to do with money, he says. ldquoMoney is just the transactions and then yoursquove got to live your le. If yoursquore hearing messages on daytime TV mocking you, or there are adverts about lsquomust-havesrsquo or suggesting yoursquore not worthyyou donrsquot consume, that canrsquot help but have an impact on you. You will feel more distant from the things that are deemed important and every day. The biggest impact of poverty is not financial, itrsquos psychological.Professor McKendrick believes this means self-reliant groups can have an impact. ldquoIt makes it tolerable, that sense of purpose, he says. ldquoYou can also be getting out and meeting people because isolation is another issue. All those softer benefits that can be quite dficult to measure.\" However, in terms of the finance, Professor McKendrick says the idea is not going to move people out of poverty in vast numbers. There are also clearly limits to what it can do to tackle poverty on a grandscale ndash last month, Grameen Foundation Scotland, the charity which provided micro-credit business loans in deprived communities, collapsed after its debts became insurmountable.And arenrsquot there other dangers in the self-reliant idea  Isnrsquot it uncomfortably close to telling people to pull their socks up or get on their bikes, the idea that the answer lies in the inidual rather than government  Professor McKendrick says there are risks and we talk about Darren McGarvey, the writer whose book about his poor upbringing in Glasgow, Poverty Safari, also promotes the idea that inidual responsibility is part of the solution to poverty.ldquoThere is a danger of highlighting a person like Darren and saying he can do it, why canrsquot you do it  says Professor McKendrick. ldquoWe canrsquot absolve responsibility as a collective and say itrsquos the responsibility of the inidual to become independent and reliant ndash for a iety of reasons, people find themselves in dficult circumstances and I think there is a collective responsibility to create an environment that allows people to nurture and to grow when they need it and itrsquos not the same time for everybody. You have to provide support that enables people to become self-reliant.The people I speak to about the self-reliant group in Ferguslie Park feel that the group has done that for them ndash there are now four small businesses up and running ndash but they also hope that it can help change the image of the area too ndash to tackle that label that sticks stubbornly to it.

There has been much written about John Beatonrsquos performance at Ibrox, much of which I do not wish to go into here, just as I do not want to talk about the inexcusable reports about the alleged threats made towards the referee according to Police Scotland.However, the fallout from the game at Ibrox and the questions surrounding the lack of clarity over punishments in Scottish football, in general, has left a sour taste in the mouths of many fans that not even a few glasses of prosecco at New Year could wash away.Something has to give.:Chris Sutton:online pub pics are valid then John Beaton guilty of \"sheer stupidity\"The Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but that of the International Football Association Boardwith such  being installed across the world to make sure the laws and protocolsof the game are followed. However, the lack of transparency in the process is the fault of the SFA. While there are good intentions in the creation of a , the lack of scrutiny given to fans must change for the good of the game.Itrsquos only January but I have now lost count of the number of clubs that have come out and slammed the shocking standards of referees and the lsquostrangersquo outcomes from the compliance board. The SFA are pulling the wool over fans eyesthey think that this abysmal standard of governing can continue. Supporters are being let down on the pitch and then assured justice will be served by the much-derided compliance group behind an Oz-like veil that is even less rewarding than following the Yellow Brick Road.But rather than admitting there is a problem and trying to tackle it, the SFA are hoping that this all blows over.And it is their hubris that is preventing the standards of our game from improving.How often have we seen a manager fined for an offence in an interview or a player sent off for a kick only to have a similar incident a week later with no repercussions Itrsquos almost asthe Judicial Panel consists of three lsquoexpertsrsquo asking a Magic  ball and hoping for the best.Can you name any other industry were such major inconsistencies would go unaddressed  Rather than coming up with a fix, the SFA seem to just want to head to the Winchester for a nice cold pint and hope it all blows over.As said previously, the Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but admitting that its rollout in Scotland hasnrsquot been as smooth as desired would go a long way with supporters. In my opinion, there is an easy fix. Whatrsquos to stop the findings of the  and the evidence used in a review being published once the case is over  Is there a reason that referee and supervisor reports and marks awarded arenrsquot published after every game While these arenrsquot monumental changes they would certainly help in giving fans a deserved insight into our officials and provide clarity on certain issues.:Celtic hit out at SFA - and call on referee John Beaton to explain Alfredo Morelos decisions at IbroxI canrsquot imagine managers and chairman disagreeing with knowing exactly what chance they have of having a punishment upheld rescinded. So what is the problem in publishing all details of the case once it has concluded  It happens in the court of law, so why canrsquot it happen following a review within the chambers of Hampden Park Any fan can accept a decision going against their teamthey can see the evidence and see the rules of the game are applied consistently, but itrsquos the SFArsquos constant desire to lsquopick and choosersquo when to punish managers and players that irritates so many. Somewhere in the process, something is going wrong, and it needs to be investigated.By being open with reviews and how rules are applied, fans would finally have insight into the whole process. Yes, some would disagree with it but at least they could see the evidence and justication into why such a decision was made.Fans and even some clubs have suggested a review of the governing body for a number of years now, but their calls have been largely ignored. Enough clubs have been critical of decisions this year to surely warrant one or at least to ask why an investigation hasnrsquot been launched The inconsistency of fines and suspensions has to stop. The picking and choosing of rules to applymust end. Hiding behind statements cannot and will not bring about real change.The SFAs inconsistent approach and weak governance is systematically destroying the game and promoting claims of bias at the very top.What harm could possibly come from a little more transparency in the game  What is there to hide Something needs to change, andthis column gets at least one more person calling for a review of the game and the inept governing body then my job has been done. Then again, I am just a fan of Scottish football, and we all know how often the SFA listens to themhellip"},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-the-political-diary","story":"THE shuffling around had one unfortunate consequence for the former FM.

In particular the surface choice of the larger pitch is important to the major field sports – hockey, football and rugby – as it can accommodate adult competitive fixtures.”Following consultation with the likes Inverurie Academy, Inverurie Hockey Club, Colony Park Football Club, Garioch Rugby Club and Garioch Sports Trust, the council proposes a ‘long pile rubber crumb’ or ‘mm G’ on the full-size pitch which would be subject to a two-yearly test to ensure its suitability for rugby.In terms of the smaller pitch, a surface suitable for hockey training and multi-sport use is required.Mr Findlay says: “This is commonly known as a ‘sand dressed’ or G surface. This surface could accommodate hockey, netball , tennis as well as general multi-sport.”He adds that the council recognises that this option is not the preferred choice of Inverurie Hockey Club and Garioch Sports Trust, but stesses officers will continue to work with the club to attempt to meet its needs, making use of the new small pitch for local training opportunities.In addition, officers will consider how best to meet the hockey club’s competitive needs at Oldmeldrum Academy including access to changing facilities and adult matchplay opportunities when required on a Saturday.Funding for the two surfaces is included within the approved project budget.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Inverurie Business Association and We Are Inverurie believe shoppers will stop visiting the town centrethe free parking ends\"  Council urged to keep free parking viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"council urged to keep free parking","story":"Inverurie Business Associationhas been working closely with We Are Inverurie to retain the town#s -minute free parking.The option to remove free off-street parking from the town has recently been under review by Aberdeenshire Council.Both of the not-for-profit organisations have voiced concerns about the latest proposal to remove  minutes free parking from towns across Aberdeenshire, including Inverurie.At the end of November Aberdeenshire Council’s report to the Infrastructure Services Committee indicated that a preferred option of the Working Group was to remove all free parking across the region.Both IBA and We Are Inverurie believe that, as Inverurie’s parking is currently ing a surplus, removing it would effectively result in people having to pay to park in the town’s subsiding other towns, a move the two organisations say is “unacceptable”.A spokesperson from IBA said: “We feel very strongly that the removal of the free parking could have a negative impact on Inverurie’s retail and town centre businesses by reducing trade from local people who pop in to the shops, visit the bank or library, or get coffee and lunch.“Most people do not carry change and the parking app available at the car parks isn’t always the easiest for everyone to use and is dependent on drivers having access to a moblie phone.“We have been canvassing feedback from our social media followers and to-date the majority of people who commented have said that the  minutes free parking encourages them to use local shops, with many saying that they would notthe free parking was removed.”IBA and We Are Inverurie have approached Aberdeenshire Council to request that they reconsider the option to retain the free -minute parking in Inverurie to support the town’s local businesses and encourage people to shop locally.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The three candidates who are contesting for the two Vice President roles within NFU Scotland will speak at the event\"  Inverurie hustings for NFU candidates viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"disney success for ne dancers","story":"Dancers from across the north east took part in the International Gathering of Scottish Highland Dancerecently.The event was held at Disneyland Paris and featured dancers from the Lawrence Dance Academy.Participants performed their own unique Disney-themed, Highland-based choreographies and compete in the annual Disney Magics Highland competition and at the Paris International Highland Gathering Championship.The dancers are also invited each year, such is their ability and stature, to dance through the Main Street of Disneyland Paris in a pre-parade that is watched live by thousands of Disney tourists.This year was no dferent, with over  Highland dancers performing and competing with great enthusiasm.Many awards, trophies and medals were won, but far more importantly each dancer and their families came away with a great experience and more friends.Principal and Director of Lawrence Dance Academy, Rhona Lawrence, said: “It’s such a great opportunity for the dancers.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Sunday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118855.jpg","title":"Oldest reactor is set to go","story":"WORK is expected to start at Dounreay early in the new year on a multimillion-pound contract to dismantle Scotlands oldest nuclear reactor.The contract ndash understood to be valued at around pound million ndash has been awarded to Cavendish Nuclear following a tendering process and is expected to last about three years.

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupSunday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It creates the impression that voters are now entirely tribal.If you take any issue of the day and feed it into Twitter or Facebook, the responses of users of those s will be of the black and white iety. Social media is no great enabler of nuance.But the truth is that huge numbers of people neither use social media nor feel the need to align themselves with a particular camp. The floating voter still exists, we just don’t hear much from her because she’s getting on with her le in the real world.If you want proof that social media isn’t the be-all-and-end-all of political debate, consider the matter of Scottish independence. Spend even a few minutes on Twitter and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Scots think of nothing other than the constitutional question.It’s undoubtedly the case that independence – whether of the Scottish or Brexit iety – is the major issue of our political times but it remains the case that other things matter, too. Not least among these important factors is the perceived competence of those who would lead us.This is a truth that should, right now, be focusing the minds of those closest to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP came to power at Holyrood in  not solely thanks to the votes of those in favour of Scottish independence. Rather, the nationalists enjoyed – and, to a lesser extent, continue to enjoy – the backing of voters who support the maintenance of the United Kingdom.The most signicant factor in creating this apparent contradiction was the widely held belief that the Labour Party had lost its way. Cast your mind back to the  election and you’ll recall how then SNP leader Alex Salmond and his team went to great s to reassure Scots that a vote for the nationalists need not be considered a vote in favour of independence. Instead, insisted Salmond, a vote for the SNP should be seen as a vote for competent government.That SNP reputation for competence may not have quite the shine it once had but – in part, thanks to Scottish Labour’s inability to mount anything like a serious opposition – it remains. The First Minister’s handling of the allegations of sexual harassment levelled by two female civil servants against Salmond stands to destroy the goodwill that has kept the SNP in power for  years.Last week’s Court of Session ruling that the Scottish Government investigation into these allegations was procedurally flawed was bad enough. The women who brought forward complaints have been left high and dry while the taxpayer faces a £,-plus bill after the government accepted it had failed to follow the process to the letter.But more was to come.We have known since the allegations about Salmond surfaced last year that Sturgeon met him on a number of occasions during which, she says, she made it clear to him that she could and would not intervene in the case.During First Minister’s Question Time on Thursday, the First Minister was forced to expand on that.It emerged, under questioning from acting Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw, that during the first of these meetings – of which no minutes exist – Sturgeon’s Chief of Staff, Liz Lloyd, was present. Lloyd – a government employee whose status as a special adviser permits her to act on party matters – was wearing her SNP hat that day, Sturgeon told MSPs.The First Minister was adamant that what was discussed that day was not a government matter. I wish her good luck sustaining that line.A meeting between the First Minister and her predecessor to discuss allegations of sexual misconduct raised by government employees is very much a government matter. To suggest otherwise is insulting.This is a view shared by some who back Sturgeon.“She should never have agreed to meet him. Simple as that,” says one party insider whose loyalties lie with the current FM rather than her predecessor. Another veteran activist, with identical sympathies, asks who in the First Minister’s team thought such meetings were at all appropriate.These Sturgeon loyalists make the point that her handling of this matter is exactly the sort of thing that began to chip away at trust in Scottish Labour.I’m bound to agree.Sturgeon – who refuses, beyond saying that she told him she would not intervene in the case, to go into detail about the discussions she had with Salmond – is now testing the goodwill of voters who believed her to be competent and honest. Without minutes of the meetings, we can only take the First Minister’s word that she acted appropriately. That’s a big ask.Despite the best efforts of Team Sturgeon to deny the existence of a civil war in the SNP over this issue, it’s perfectly clear that hostilities between supporters of the First Minister and supporters of Salmond represent exactly that. The SNP is now angrily ided. People have picked sides.A number of high-profile Salmond supporters – former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, former health secretary Alex Neil and former presiding officer Tricia Marwick among them – have come out to bat on his behalf.The response from the Sturgeon camp has been rather muted.One party insider says: “Nobody on Sturgeon’s side is used to war. They don’t know how to handle what’s happening.”That same source makes the point that, when Salmond was first minister, Sturgeon, former SNP communications chief Kevin Pringle and former MP Angus Robertson formed a tightly-knit unit that advised and, to some degree, controlled their boss, and asks who performs the same role for the current party leader  It certainly appears that Sturgeon would have benefited from having people on her team who would have advised against meeting Salmond.SNP infighting over the Salmond investigation will only get bloodier, while the First Minister’s role in matters can only further erode her credibility with the moderate mainstream voters she needsthe nationalists are to win the next Holyrood election.We may now be witnessing the beginning of the end of the SNP’s dominance of our politics.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855756.1547330852!/image/image.jpg","title":"grassroots to send ultimatum to corbyn on brexit","story":"Senior Labour figures will face immediate pressure from party members to change party policy and oppose Brexit within hours of the meaningful vote on Theresa May#s deal with Brussels.Key allies of Jeremy Corbyn at the top of the Labour party will be confronted with grassroots demands for a second EU referendum less than  hours after the Commons vote, set for Tuesday, which the government is expected to lose heavily.The Prime Minister will have three days toto the Commons with a “plan B” for Brexit, during which time opposition parties will also seek to impose their will on the next steps in the process.The Labour leader has resisted pressure to fully embrace a second EU referendum that could reverse Brexit, saying his priority is a general election.But this week saw confusion at the highest levels over what Brexit policy Labour would take into that election, with members of the shadow cabinet and Scottish party leader Richard Leonard facing criticism for failing to spell out the position, while shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said an extension of Article  was now “inevitable”.A survey of Labour members found that  per cent want a second referendum on EU membership, and polling suggests the party could be particularly badly hit in ScotlandLabour backs May’s Brexit deal.The YouGov poll for the People’s Vote campaign found that support for Labour in Scotland would fall by  percentage points to  per cent, costing all but one of the party’s seven MPs north of the border.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rebecca Long-Bailey, will hear direct pleas from party members for a robust anti-Brexit policy at a key policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday at Labour HQ in London.The two Labour front benchers sit on the Economy, Business and Trade Commission of the party’s National Policy Forum , which will consider submissions from ordinary members, elected Labour officials and constituency Labour parties.The open submissions process has been flooded with demands for a People’s Vote since Corbyn gave an interview to thesaying that Labour would press ahead with Brexitit won power. At its conference in September, members committed the party to seek a fresh EU votea general election can’t be secured.Out of  new submissions since  December,  call for Labour to support a second referendum or oppose Brexit.A Labour source said: “Members are making clear their fury about Labour’s ambiguous position on Brexit. Jeremy promised that his leadership would be led by the membership, so the membership is making it clear that he must drop his support for Brexit.“It’s vital that NPF reps and the leadership listen to what the members are saying, come out firmly against any type of Brexit, and back a People’s Vote.“If we fail to do so, the voters will notus to power.”As well as submissions from constituency parties, iniduals have made their views known, with one warning the party’s policy on Brexit “is no longer tenable”, while another writes: “If we go into the next election offering Brexit-lite, just as we did offering austerity-lite under Ed Miliband, we will lose the next election.”Several other influential figures within the Labour movement sit on the Economy, Business and Trade Commission, including union chiefs Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, and Tim Roache, who leads the GMB.

Leonard says it marks the latest failings by the SNP Government to “stand up for Scottish workers”.He said: “Scotland desperately needs a plan to deliver fair work to protect our workforce from unscrupulous bosses and insecure work.“The SNP Government has failed to publish its fair work action plan at the same time as trying to cut trade unions out of pay negotiations and failing to pay the living wage. That tells you everything you need to know about its priorities.“Labour was founded by the trade unions and will always protect and promote workers’ rights. “We will put workers at the heart of our plans to revive our industries, ban zero-hours contracts and create the high-wage, high-skill jobs of the future.”Over the past year, the SNP Government has come under signicant pressure over public sector pay. Education Secretary John Swinney has been criticised over claims he sought to bypass trade unions in pay negotiations by writing directly to teachers during the pay ballot.

Salmond won a dramatic victory over the government he once led at the Court of Session last Tuesday after it emerged that an inquiry into claims of sexual harassment against him by two women was “unlawful” and “tainted” by an appearance of bias.The fall-out has left Nicola Sturgeon fighting for her political le after damaging revelations came to light about a series of meetings with Salmond – three in person and two phone calls – to discuss the investigation while it was under way. Taxpayers are also facing a legal bill of up to £, after Salmond won full costs and he is also considering suing the Scottish Government.Salmond has already called on Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans to quit over the implosion of the case. A statement released by Evans immediately after the case insisted that a new “procedure” to oversee complaints against current and former ministers is “robust”.Salmond had been challenging this procedure before a flaw in the way it was applied came to light. It emerged the head of the investigation, before being appointed to the role, had previously been in contact with the two women making the complaints and advised them on the issue.It was on this basis that the government case collapsed on Tuesday and Evans stated afterwards: “All other grounds of Mr Salmond’s challenge have been dismissed.”But this has been rejected by the former first minister.“The Permanent Secretary is in denial and her claims are materially misleading,” a spokesman for Salmond said.“She tried to suggest that the court rejected the arguments made by Mr Salmond which is absolutely the opposite of what occurred. “The whole action was dismissed on the basis of the Scottish Government’s concession that they had acted unlawfully, as well as all of the expenses, and therefore we didn’t need to go any further in comprehensively winning the case. “The Scottish Government case collapsed at the very first hurdle. They would have fallen at all the other hurdles as wellthe case had continued to the full hearing.” But a Scottish Government spokesman said last night: “The court order is clear. It says that all other aspects ofSalmond’s petition were ‘dismissed’.“The Scottish Government co-operated fully with the court process for the recovery of documents. “The full picture only became clear in December  as a result of work being undertaken to produce documents in advance of the hearing.“It was in light of that work that we agreed to settle the case. As the Permanent Secretary has made clear, the single procedural flaw which led to this decision is deeply regrettable.”A separate police investigation has been launched into the claims made against Salmond dating back to December  when he was first minister. But once this has concluded Evans has made clear that the Scottish Government could re-launch an inquiry into Salmond – using the same procedure introduced in late  in response to the global #MeToo movement.This could raise the prospect of a fresh legal challenge from Salmond over his original contention that the process used to investigate him was unfair. He has previously claimed that he was denied access to witnesses and blocked from presenting his own side of the case. The “flaw” over the links between the investigating officer and the two women need not have brought about the collapse of the government’s case. Ministers could have sought to have the case remitted for further action. Although this would still have meant a symbolic victory for Salmond, it would none the less have allowed the government to restart its inquiry, this time using the correct procedure. Salmond’s spokesman added: “Their legal position was hopeless which is why their case collapsed before we even got to the first day of the hearing and interestingly before all the internal documents they were so reluctant to produce and required to be extracted from them by a commission ordered by Lord Pentland were discussed in open court. These documents are legal dynamite.”It emerged that members of Sturgeon’s inner circle, including chief of staff Liz Lloyd, were among those to give evidence in the case before it collapsed.Ministers have denied any link between this and the government conceding defeat.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855654.1547306650!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s largest teaching union approves strike ballot over pay","story":"One of Scotland#s largest teaching unions has given its approval to open a statutory strike ballot over pay.EIS will issue a formal notice of the planned ballot to local authority employers next week, with ballot papers to be issued later this month.The approval from the EIS Council was given at a specially convened meeting on Saturday.: Teaching union recommends ballot over strikesUnions claim teachers’ pay has fallen % in real terms in the past decade, and say that a signicant increase is needed to show teachers they are valued and to help boost staff recruitment and retention.Earlier this week, the union rejected the latest pay offer from the Scottish Government and council umbrella body Cosla.Education Secretary John Swinney said that the offer was “a better deal than for any group of public sector workers in the UK”.EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: “EIS Council has today approved the opening of a statutory strike ballot over pay.“We have been negotiating for a year, on a pay claim that was due to be settled last April. Teachers’ patience is now exhausted.“Our preference has always been to agree a fair deal through negotiation, but we have been very clear, also, that we are prepared to take strike action should this be necessary to achieve an acceptable settlement.”“Ballot papers will be issued later this month. Clearly, once the actual ballot is under way, negotiations are suspended but prior to that we remain prepared to consider any improved pay offer. No offer has been forthcoming from our local authority employers, however.“Teachers have demonstrated time and time again their support for our Value Education Value Teachers campaign, which is about more than just pay. I’m confident that will continue to be the case.”Mr Swinney said: “In light of concerns raised about the position of the signicant number of teachers already at the top of the main grade pay scale, the Scottish Government is prepared to improve its offer around main grade restructuring and revaluation of all other SNCT pay scales.“The Scottish Government will provide the extra funding, which is in addition to the local government settlement.“Under this scenario, teachers would receive a minimum % increase between January  and April  and a further % rise in April .“This is a clear indication of our commitment to recruit and retain teachers, and I urge the teaching unions to consider this favourably so that parties can bring discussions to a conclusion.“I made this proposal to the EIS on Thursday. It is an enhanced offer and I will ask Cosla to agree this and to formally offer it to unions after January . I believe this must be put to teachers for their consideration.“I welcome the agreement by EIS to allow further time to reach an agreement. Industrial action is in no-one’s interests, not least our children and young people. That has been my focus and will continue to be until this is resolved.”Scottish Greens education spokesman Ross Greer MSP said: “Teachers are overworked, under-resourced and have suffered a % real terms pay cut.“They will continue to have Green support in their campaign for fair pay.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855733.1547319502!/image/image.jpg","title":"grand return for flying scotsman to inverness","story":"The world#s most famous locomotive is ing to Scotland # but passengers will have to pay up to # for the experience.Flying Scotsman will visit Inverness from Edinburgh in May for only the second time in its -year history.The cost of the excursion for those in first class includes champagne and cakes and three nights in a four-star hotel in the Highland capital.However, excursions during the trip will cost extra and thejourney will be hauled by a diesel-powered engine rather than steam.Premium standard passengers, paying £ each, will receive free tea and coffee and be put up at a Holiday Inn Express.Last year, Flying Scotsman ran trips from Edinburgh over the Forth Bridge and round Fe for £ for first-class passengers and £ in premium standard.The locomotive previously visited Inverness in  as part its last visit to Scotland.May’s tour will see the engine jointly haul the train with Mayflower, a B class steam locomotive built in . Mayflower will also run separate trips from Inverness during the tour to Wick and Thurso, and Kyle of Lochalsh, at extra cost.A spokeswoman for organisers The Steam Dreams Rail Co, said: “This time, instead of the short trips around the Fe Circle, we are offering a four-day tour to Inverness, with Flying Scotsman and sister locomotive Mayflower double-heading on the first day from Edinburgh to Inverness, via the Forth Bridge and the Highland main line.”She said the price of the tickets reflected the extra cost of having two locomotives, with the trip part of a nine-day tour from London.Steam Dreams owner David Buck said: “Flying Scotsman has not been to Inverness in recent history, and to experience the two locomotives performing at full power over this steeply-graded railway will be a great prospect for all lovers of steam. “It is the first time we have given passengers from Scotland an opportunity to join part of one of our nine-day tours.”The visit will be Flying Scotsman’s fourth consecutive annual foray north of the border. Other previous excursions have been on the Borders Railway.The locomotive made a special trip from London King’s Cross to York on Friday as a memorial to Sir William McAlpine, who was credited with rescuing the engine and paying for its restoration when he bought it in .Flying Scotsman was designed by Edinburgh-born Sir Nigel Gresley to haul the same-named Edinburgh-London express on the east coast main line.It was the first steam locomotive to reach mph, in , and set a record for the longest non-stop run, of  miles, in Australia in . The engine was restored at a cost of more than £ million by the National Railway Museum.Further Flying Scotsman trips are expected to be announced shortly by the museum.Steam will also come to Aberdeen this summer with Tornado, which featured in Paddington  and on Top Gear, hauling a new service called The Aberdonian.The locomotive, built in , will run the service in March, August and September, withfares costing between £ and £.Graeme Bunker-James, operations director of The A Steam Locomotive Trust, which runs Tornado, said: “We are extremely proud to be launching ‘The Aberdonian’ series of new special steam-hauled trains.”The Jacobite steam train between Fort William and Mallaig will also , with daily trips between April and October. Sir Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, which runs tracks and signals, said: “Tornado is a shining example of British engineering, reflecting the country that invented railways, and giving pleasure on every trip to thousands of Scots as it traverses Scotland.“I hope this series of trips becomes a permanent feature of the Scottish railway scene.” The Bo’ness-based Scottish Railway Preservation Society has yet to announce whether it will repeat last year’s steam-hauled trips over the Forth Bridge and round Fe.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855706.1547316841!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli lost leader gives corbyn cause to cringe","story":"Shortly after MPs voted against the government to limit the Treasury#s powers in the event of no deal, Steve Anglesey, journalist for the pro-Remain newspaper The New European, tweeted a photograph of Yvette Cooper with the caption: #The leader of the Opposition has turned up.#Like all good political sideswipes, this one took its power from its pinpoint accuracy. With her amendment to the finance bill, the backbench MP had done more to try to safeguard the country from the worst-case scenario than Jeremy Corbyn has done in months .Cooper’s move means that, should the government want to use some of the specic powers in the finance bill to implement no deal, it would have to first give parliament a vote or apply to extend article . It does not prevent no deal but it does make it more dficult to navigate and so, arguably, reduces the likelihood of it taking place.With typical churlishness, Corbyn failed to acknowledge Cooper’s achievement in a statement he said Labour was taking every opportunity to prevent no deal, without ever mentioning her name.Other people, however, were more appreciative. And not for the first time, the words “ only” were repeated as a lament to past leadership elections and missed opportunities. Corbyn’s simmering resentment of his former rival is only to be expected. Cooper may have come a poor third when she stood against him in the  she may have been pushed to the backbenches by those who despise her as a Blairite, but her quiet strengths still serve to accentuate Corbyn’s blustering weaknesses.The Tory government could not have done more to sabotage itself and its citizensit had assembled the finest minds in the country and asked them to draw up a step-by-step plan. Any political leader worth a damn would be annihilating Theresa May at PMQs every week and charting a clear route out of the current crisis.Instead, Corbyn has dithered and delayed. Every trap that has been set for him, he has fallen into every internal problemhe has exacerbated. If an opportunity to land a blow has presented itself to him, he has squandered it. Thus the Tory party staggers on critically wounded, but with no-one willing or able to put it out of its misery.At no point has Corbyn come up with a coherent strategy on Brexit. His own MPs and MSPs have been in a constant state of confusion over the party’s position on everything from whether or not to stay in the Customs Union to whether or not to support a second referendum.Now Corbyn has called for a general election to break the deadlock yet such is the internal disarray that, on Thursday, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard was unable to say whether the party intended to campaign for or against leaving the EU.As Corbyn and his shadow cabinet have been failing to bring down a government already on its knees, Cooper has been distinguishing herself in the Home Affairs Select Committee and on the back benches. When May announced the snap general election in April , Cooper won plaudits for her caustic put-down. “The Prime Minister said yesterday that she was calling a General Election because parliament was blocking Brexit, but three-quarters of this parliament voted for article  and two-thirds of the Lords voted for article , so that’s not true, is it ” she said.“A month ago she told her official spokesman to rule out an election and that wasn’t true either, was it  She wants us to believe that she is a woman of her word but isn’t the truth that we cannot believe a single word she says ” She attacked the government on its decision to end a scheme to take lone child refugees and single-handedly forced the resignation of Amber Rudd during the Windrush scandal with one quietly delivered, but dynamite question: “Targets for removals [deportations] – when were they set ” she asked. Rudd denied any such targets existed – a statement quickly established as  – and so she had to go.Admittedly, Cooper comes with baggage. As her critics never tire of pointing out, she previously backed a stricter asylum regime and did not oppose the government’s Immigration Bill. She also voted in favour of the Iraq War and lobbied to restrict benefits for new EU migrants.Having said that, were Brexit to happen, without or without a deal, the situation for EU migrants would be considerably worse. In a Westminster and Labour Party with a superfluity of egos and a dearth of semi-competent operators, at least Cooper comes across as serious, able and committed.Corbyn posits himself as the voice of the working classes, yet he has done little to try to stop the economic havoc that is about to be unleashed upon themCooper is a dreaded centrist, but understands voters were sold a lie, and that the most vulnerable will be the hardest hit.Accused of being unpatriotic for trying to make it more dficult for the Prime Minister, she insisted it would \u2028be unpatriotic to do anything , given the damage a no-deal Brexit would inflict.For this, former Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts derided her as earnest and compared her to a kindergarten teacher talking down to her pupils. She saw herself, he said, as more in tune with morality than others. Looking round Westminster at the moment that seems a reasonable assumption. After all, the bar isn’t set very high. Amidst the preening and braying of the Brexiteer donkeys, and the student politics posturing of the Corbyn camp, her sober,slightly sanctimonious, manner is a breath of fresh air.After Cooper’s performance in the wake of the snap general election announcement, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell was seen mouthing the words “leadership pitch”. In the end there was no third leadership contest it is impossible to know whether Labour would have won had she been at the helm.But Cooper’s achievement in forcing the first of two humiliating government defeats means she is once again a contender, with some admirers suggesting she should be asked to head up a Government of National UnityGiven there is less unity in Westminster than there is at the average wedding scramble, this seems unlikely. But she does now feel like a leader-in-waiting.Last weekend, one poll suggested Labour would lose by a landslideit backed Brexit in any forthcoming general election and yet even this does not appear to be focusing minds.On the evidence of the past few days, Cooper is exactly what the party needs: a woman capable of taking on the Tories with a grit, determination and charm that Corbyn lacks a woman who understands that the point of being in Opposition is to try to get yourself back into power.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a","story":"SOME lucky folk had an amazing view of a pod of killer whales off west Unst last Friday. A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"help for families feeling the pinch after christmas ","story":"The Scottish government plea is being made as it was revealed that about half a million people across the country are not claiming all the support they are entitled to.Impartial advice is available through the government-funded Financial Health Check scheme provided by Citizens Advice.The health checks were launched in November and cabinet secretary for communities Aileen Campbell said: “Too many people are not accessing everything they could be, and we want to ensure the right support is there to help people make the most of their financial situation.#The service will cover issues such as access to free school meals, benefit uptake, council tax reduction and cheaper deals on energy and other utilities to reduce household costs.“If you’re a parent struggling to make ends meet, you’re not alone.

been an incredible year and were really excited to be celebrating Hamishs first birthday today.\"Were hoping Hamish enjoys the day as much as us, and weve made him a special birthday cake made from

still has some way to go until he reaches his full adult size, as male polar bears can weigh up to  kilogrammes.\"In the wild, polar bear cubs will stay with their mothers for two to three years, learning key survival skills before leaving to start their own families.When Hamish is ready to leave Victoria, it is hoped he will play a role in the European endangered species breeding programme.Barbara Smith, chief executive of park owners the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: \"Hamishs arrival has helped us to highlight the threats that many wild animals are facing and the small changes we can make to really make a big dference.\"As a wildle conservation charity, we believe we have a duty to help protect this magnicent species which is predicted to signicantly reduce in numbers over the next  years as the reduction in sea ice, the polar bears primary seal hunting , continues.\"Our polar bears are part of the European Endangered Species Programme and we hope

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Former client Helen Boyd shared her journey highlighting the very positive impact the Family Nurse Partnership programme had on her le.She described the challenges and hurdles encountered from discovering she was pregnant, to adjusting to motherhood and ultimately moving into full time employment. She described how instrumental the supportive relationship she shared with her family nurse was in enabling her to manage these challenges.Congratulating the new graduates, Roberta Brownlee, Chair of the Southern Trust said: “Being a parent is of course so rewarding but as all of us mums and dads know it isn’t always easy.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good. It was hard getting used to the TV cameras and being involved in the whole makeup thing, but it’s good craic. I was getting slegged about the makeup the whole day, but it was good craic. It’s all part and parcel of the show. “The whole experience has been phenomenal.

However, he admits that it“would be a big bonus” and is asking the people of Belfast to give him their support.“For me it’s about networking and the doors it could open,” he said. “There was a girl on last year called Chantelle Patton, she didn’t win it but she ended up in Nashville this year – that’s the kind doors it could open.“If local people support me it would be great. Even winning Best of the West three years in a row was crazy, it really takes you aback when people are voting for you. I would love a wee push on this one. It would be really much appreciated.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast city hall turns red in campaign by irish language speakers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order. Just over half of UUP members would transfer to the DUP in elections. A third said they would give a lower preference to the SDLP and % to Sinn Fein. Once an integrationist party, the UUP is now very pro-devolution which has % membership support compared to % for direct rule."},{"url":null,"title":"civil servants planning northern ireland emergency fuel operations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But this did not extend to reopening the deal signed off at a special summit on November .\"No-deal would be a catastrophe both for our British friends and for continental Europeans. So every effort must be made between now and Tuesday to bring this important issue to a good conclusion,\" Mr Juncker told reporters.He refused to speculate on what form the EUs \"help for Mrs May\" would take.Observers in London said they expect the Prime Minister cannot recruit enough pro-EU Labour MPs to offset the loss of the  DUP MPs and dozens of her own party members, and Northern Ireland remained a crucial issue.Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionists have accused the Secretary of State of destabilising Northern Ireland and emboldening Sinn Fein by her reported remarks that a no-deal Brexit will lead to a border poll. MEP Jim Nicholson said Karen Bradley had made a \"series of ill-judged and irresponsible comments\".The DUP and the TUV accused her of scaremongering.Mr Nicholson said: \"Recent reported comments by the Secretary of State on a border poll simply help to embolden Sinn Fein and create further destabilisation in Northern Ireland.\"I am appalled by the Secretary of States behaviour - she is doing enormous damage to Northern Ireland.\"However, Mrs Bradley insisted that the withdrawal agreement was the \"best thing\" for the future of the Union.She declined to be drawn on reports that she had warned Cabinet colleagues that a border poll would be much more likely in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But she said she was aware of her obligation to call such a referendumthere were evidence of a change in public opinion here in favour of reunication.On a visit to Belfast yesterday, she was asked whether a no-deal would make a border poll more likely.She responded: \"Ive said that I believe the best thing for the United Kingdom, the whole United Kingdom and the Union of the United Kingdom, is leaving the EU together as one UK with a deal. That is the best thing for the UK and that is what I am focused on delivering.\"Asked about her reported warning at Cabinet on Tuesday, Mrs Bradley said: \"I am not commenting on what may or may not have been said at a private meeting.\"But I am well aware of my statutory obligations under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and I am well aware the constitutional status of Northern Ireland is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.\"My job as Secretary of State is to deliver a deal that gets us out of the EU as one United Kingdom and is good for everybody in the United Kingdom, and that means everybody in Northern Ireland.\"Thats what I am working to deliver.\"TUV leader Jim Allister claimed little heed was paid to what Mrs Bradley said in Northern Ireland, although \"republicans are probably drawing comfort from her support for the backstop betrayal and foolish talk about a border poll\".DUP MP Gavin Robinson insisted that Theresa Mays deal undermined the Union.\"If Karen Bradley was really sincere she would support calls to bin the backstop,\" Mr Robinson said.Sinn Fein MLA Jemma Dolan said: \"The people of the North have already rejected Brexit and they should be given the opportunity to decide which union they want to belong to.\""},{"url":null,"title":"full rollout of universal credit benefit delayed in northern ireland until","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The British people have already waited for almost three years – they should not have to wait any longer.”His intervention came in a report published by Economists for Free Trade, in which fellow Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg also said there was “nothing to fear” from leaving the EU without a deal.Mr Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group of Conservative MPs, claimed that while it would be better to leave with a deal, the advantages of Brexit would come through sooner without an agreement.He said: “In addition to goods continuing to flow, under a No-Deal departure, the British taxpayer would save £ billion, money which could be used to cut taxes, to help our domestic economy and leave plenty to help any exporters who face particularly high tarfs.“The advantages of Brexit would come through sooner with trade barriers going down in  instead of  which could see the cost of food, clothing and footwear fall sharplythe Government followed sensible policies. This particularly helps the least well off in society.”Tory former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, in the same report, suggested the “real reason” for the “Establishment hysteria” surrounding a no-deal exit “is that we actually would be leaving”.“The other options now being floated – extending Article , a second referendum, or the subjugation demanded by the Withdrawal Agreement – are designed to hold the UK in the EU’s orbit in the hope that it may be sucked back in,” he said.“These options would completely fail to honour the biggest democratic verdict ever delivered in British history,” he said.“The optimal Brexit outcome remains a wide-ranging, zero-tarf free trade agreement as offered repeatedly by President Tusk. Such a deal can still be negotiated, but not by the end of March.“Having wasted so much time on the Withdrawal Agreement, leaving on WTO terms is now the only way to break free fully and build a more prosperous, independent future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say january","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with. People should not have to constantly watch their step while out walking and while many dog owners are careful to clean up after their pets, there are those who donrsquot care.Cllr Walker said improving the districtrsquos cleanliness was at the heart of the new campaign.He said that while reminding dog owners to clean up after their dogs was important, one way of dealing with the problem was hitting them in the pocket with a fine.He added: ldquoI have always said dog owners who break the law should be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and still hold this view.

Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas.

Next stop is Armagh before the production arrives at the Down Arts Centre.After each performance, there will be a professionally facilitated audience discussion, dealing with issues raised by the play: cultural and religious identity, enforced deportation, reconciliation and coming to terms with the past, the immigrant experience, mutual respect for others, the restorative power of art in conflict situations.Tickets for the Downpatrick production can be booked by contacting the Arts Centre on   , or email downartscentre@downdc.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Joint effort to address Strangford ferry issues  ","story":"POLITICIANS on both sides of Strangford Lough are to join forces to help improve the busy waterwayrsquos ferry crossing and address local concerns.As part of a two-pronged initiative, they are to meet with the arearsquos most senior roads official who is responsible for the service at the end of the month.A meeting with the Department for Infrastructurersquos Permanent Secretary is also being sought.Two key issues will dominate the agenda at both meetings mdash the need to address traffic congestion in the heart of Strangford and agreement for an earlier morning crossing from the Portaferry side of the lough.There was unanimous support at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to raise timetabling and operational issues with senior civil servants to address increasing concern on both sides of the waterway.Local politicians will be joined by their North Down and Ards counterparts for a meeting with roads official Simon Richardson on January , with the councillors and MPs and MLAs from the South Down and Strangford constituencies hoping to meet soon after with Department for Infrastructure Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey.Congestion at peak periods, especially during bank holidays and over the summer are common place in Strangford, frustrating residents and business owners in particular.Politicians want civil servants to ensure drivers wishing to board the ferry use a dedicated lane which runs alongside the ferry terminal.The lane is rarely used and politicians are calling for additional finance to be provided so staff can ensure the lane is more fully utilised to combat the congestion problem.In Portaferry, many people use the ferry crossing to make their way to work on this side of Strangford Lough but the first morning sailing is always busy.As a result, some passengers are forced to leave their car in Strangford all week, travelling as foot passengers on the ferry to make sure they get the early crossing.Councillors say that given the number of people who use the ferry in the morning, there is a need for an earlier sailing than the first scheduled crossing at .am.The concerns of commuters, residents and business owners were highlighted on Monday night by a number of politicians following a motion tabled by Cllr Cadogan Enright.He said: ldquoOn the Strangford side, those responsible for the ferry service maintain they can save on personnel costs by not using the dedicated queuing area as part of their normal operations.ldquoThis results in in regular blockages and there are letters from Translink and local businesses complaining about regular shutdowns in the village due to congestion, with the line of vehicles extending back along the Downpatrick Road. The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers. We need to ensure there is enough resource to accommodate ferry traffic flow and demand to minimise the impact on Strangford residents.Cllr Billy Walker suggested the provision of a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry should perhaps be considered.Cllr Enrightrsquos motion was also supported by Cllrs Willie Clarke, Jill Macauley and John Trainor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Mahon Cup success for disciplined St Michael’s  ","story":"THE final of the long-standing Mahon Cup was played out before an appreciative crowd in the Drumaness clubrooms just before Christmas.In the final were holders St Michaelrsquos from Downpatrick and Queenrsquos Hall from Newtownards.League sponsor Gary Rodgers conducted the draw for the match pairings, which saw Gareth McKeever up first against Alastair McDonald and Bobby Douglas taking on Keith Lemon.McDonald got into his stride the quicker and soon built up a good lead over Gareth at  points to .

There was no school reputation, no building, no funding, no resources. They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it. But I did apply as it was a teaching principalship and it was working with both sides of the community as all the work I had done with cross-community work just kept saying to me, lsquoThis is really important work, this needs to be done to break down barriersrsquo.The road to establishing Millennium was far from smooth, however, as the grandmother of three can testy.ldquoYou just wouldnrsquot believe the terrible trouble we had and itrsquos hard to believe now what happened, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoDays before we were due to open, I had  primary ones and no funding and no site as there was a lot of opposition to establishing the school where we had originally planned to in the Carryduff area.ldquoWe ended up down at Breda Park, close to Forestside in Belfast in an old heath trust building. We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

It will be his second stint as president.However, there was an opposition boycott of the vote, and international bodies severely criticised the running of the election, with the EU’s High Representative saying the process went ahead “without complying with the minimum international standards for a credible process, [and] not respecting political pluralism, democracy, transparency and rule of law”.Mr Shannon, who has raised the issue of Venezuela in the Commons in the past, said the country is in a “dire situation” and “as a result of his election will get even worse again”.He added: “[Sinn Fein] should be questioning whether the election was fair and did it give people the opportunity to vote in a fully democratic method like we have in this country, for instance. I’d suggest to them that it didn’t.“I think they’ve a question to ask themselves.“I think it’d be beholden better of Sinn Feinthey were highlighting the total autocratic power the president has and the way he carries out policing in his country, to the detriment of people who do not have any human rights.“I’d be saying to Sinn Fein that they should be looking at their support for Maduro on the grounds of his legacy so far of devaluing human rights, his actions against protestors, the claims and allegations of torture and so on that have taken place, and of a country whose economy is falling apart.“It’s a country ruled by a despot who has no regard whatsoever for his citizens.”Last year’s vote happened amid a massive economic crisis, with Human Rights Watch reporting Venezuelans face “severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies, and food”.There is a also intense hostility to dissent Amnesty International recently condemned “excessive and undue force to disperse protests”.And a report by the UN commissioner last year documented abuses which included killings carried out by the security forces during protests, “high levels of impunity” for those security forces, the use of “arbitrary detention”, and the use of torture Venezuela’s attorney-general has given a tally of  people killed in security operations over a  month period in -, and it is estimated by the UN that over . million people left Venezuela between  and  under Maduro.Among the international observers of the  election process was Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard, who said in a statement at the time that it was “an honour” to have been invited by Venezuela’s National Electoral Council to take part, adding: “Sinn Fein have consistently supported the highest standards of human rights for all people.”And in a Sinn Fein statement this week annoucing attendance at the inauguration, Conor Murphy said: “Nicolas Maduro Moros was democratically elected by the Venezuelan people to serve as their President during the term -. We’ll use our presence in Venezuela to express our continuing solidarity to the people supporting their legitimate demands to build a just and equal society free from foreign intervention.”In response to Mr Shannon’s criticism, Sinn Fein said it “will take no lectures from the DUP on human rights when they are propping up the Tories who plan to repeal the Human Rights Act and are committed to a disgraceful denial of rights to large sections of society in the north”.try catch            ..

HELEN MCGURK reports on the dwindling appeal of smokingMany readers will remember theold days, when smoking in enclosed, fug-filled spaces, like aeroplanes, buses and offices, was perfectly fine. Ex smoker Jason ShankeyTime was, everyone smoked my parents did, my primary schoolteacher didso did my -year-old friend, who pilfered Woodbines from the pockets of hergranny’s housecoat. On television we watched snooker players, like belligerent Belfast boy Alex Higgins, puffing away between potting, as a thick pea-souper of smoke hung over the auditorium, whilst darts’ players like Eric Bristow and pudgy Scot, Jockey Wilson, both smoked like trains. Cars were equipped with fiddly ashtrays and cigarette lightersit was a rite of passage for all children to burn themselves on a car cigarette lighter at least once before the age of .I remember going to visit relatives and a cake stand of cigarettes would be passed around along with the tea and butterfly buns. Perfectly normal hospitality. I also recall puffing on sweetie cigarettes as my friends and I played the popular game of the day, ‘-a-Day Habit’. The candy cigarettes were banned in the UK in the s, and we were forced to find our kicks where. From black and white movies, with iconic smokers like James Dean, Lauren Bacall and Marlene Dietrich, to teen rebellion, smoking has lit up our culture and had a certain cachet until we realised it could kill us. Further back, smoking was once such an esteemed activity that it was awarded its own jacket: waist-, with a shawl collar and fashioned out of velvet or silk, it was designed to protect gentlemen’s normal attire from the scent of smoke, which was an offence to the ladies. Most forms of cigarette advertising are now banned in the UK. However, in their prime, they were influential works of art. Remember the one where the cuddly St Bernard would toddle over a mountain with some St Bruno tobacco in a pouch around his big, fluffy neck for a man stuck in a snow-bound hut, or the slogan ‘happiness is a cigar called Hamlet’.During my university days I decided to take up smoking. All the witheringly cool students smoked so I thought it would be hip to follow suit. What a mistake. Smoking is not big and it’s not clever. Never mind the expense, it makes you stink like a pub carpetand can give you cancer. Sinn Fein urged to re-think support for Venezuelan ‘despot’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Eventually I wised up, and with the help of nicotine patches stopped the awful habit. As the graphshows cigarette smoking is declining. In Northern Ireland, with . per centof the population classied as smokers. That figure is down from  per cent just two years ago. Another person who decided to kick the habit and believes the start of a new year is a good time to start, is businessman Jason Shankey, who runs a group of hair and skincare salons in Belfast.‘‘I started smoking at  years of age. I suppose at the time it was because my mates were all smoking and we used to buy singles at the petrol station. By the time I was in first year I was buying a packet of , spending my money on cigarettes instead of lunch. The habit gradually crept up on me then. I couldn’t imagine myself going through the day without smoking. It was an addiction but I didn’t see it like that. I enjoyed smoking. I liked the flavour and the sociable aspect of it, as it was a lot more sociable years ago. ‘‘By the time I reached fth year I was smoking  a day, though at weekends, that probably went up to  a dayI was having a drink. I never really thought about the detrimental effects it could be having on my health. Of course I’d seen the anti-smoking ads and the warnings on the packets but I was addicted, so I turned a blind eye.‘‘Then in  I just got fed up with smoking and decided to quit. I managed to stop for a year. But I wasn’t in the right mind-set to stop. I put on five stone because my appetite increased and I was eating more food in place of the cigarettes. I remember being on a skiing holiday and we were in an Austrian hotel. People were smoking around me and I could smell it, so I went out and bought myself a packet of cigarettes. I also remember leaning over to tie my ski boots and not being able to reach down because I’d put on so much weight. That also influenced my decision to go out and buy the cigarettes. Within six months I was back to my normal size again. ‘‘I know now that it was all down to the way I approached giving up smoking. The second time I quit, my thought process was completely dferent and I had the help of a great book, The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. It sets you up psychologically for success by telling you it’s not dficult to stop smoking. The marketing around smoking may not be visual now but there’s still a lot of hype around stopping and smokers are led to believe that it’s really tough to quit. One you realise this isn’t the case, it becomes easier. He also compares smoking to putting your lips on an exhaust pipe and inhaling, which is basically what you’re doing, just a dferent context. ‘‘The toughest part of quitting is up until day three but by day  you’re no longer addicted. That’s only three weeks out of your le. When you think about it like that, it makes it a lot easier. I’d quit smoking by the time I’d finished the book. People fear giving up but it’s all down to you having the right mind-set. I haven’t smoked since, not even one.The other thing that really helped me was the Android app QuitNow! Pro, which tells you the date you stopped, the money you’ve saved and the health benefits. I’ve saved £, from stopping smoking! And when it comes to health benefits, I’m now % on all of them, bar lung cancer but I’m % of the way to being the same as a non-smoker when it comes to the risk of developing lung cancer.Of course, Jason says when it comes to giving up cigarettes, everyone is dferent. ‘‘What works for some may not work for others, but anyone looking for advice on how to quit should look up Cancer Focus NI’s website cancerfocusni.org cancer-prevention smoking .’’try catch            ..

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join. There are no auditions and no previous choir experience is needed.The concert saw many people turn up to enjoy the music alongside a iety of refreshments.Dafydd Jones, administrator of the Parish of All Saints Church and organiser of the Music at Lunchtime programme of concerts, said the concert was a great way to start the season.He said: \"An enjoyable time was had by all - audience and performers who have, by the way, expressed a willingness, nay an enthusiasm, to come back for amatch next year.\"After welcoming the audience and thanking them for their attendance, I introduced the Town Mayor, Cllr Jon Luxton who spoke briefly about Music at Lunchtime, the Barry Community Choir and All Saints Church also expressed a desire to come back for other concerts in the future.\"The choir performed a most enjoyable pot-pourri of songs from the shows amongst many others and ended up with a foot-tapping medley of World War One favourites. All in all, a heart-warming programme of music, appreciated by everyone.\"This yearrsquos autumn programme of recitals at All Saints Church continues throughout October and November with an exciting mix of vocal and instrumental soloists and ensembles.All Saints Church is accessible to the disabled and the elderly and also boasts creche facilities.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Though he had asthma from birth, Tiernan didn’t appear to suffer any attacks until he was aged . While he used the blue Ventolin inhaler, he never used the brown one, which is a steroid, according to his dad Stephen. When Tiernan came to his mum and dad’s room for help that morning, they tried everything to help him but he was gone within  minutes.Tiernan GreenHis tragic passing plunged Lurgan into shock and grief as many of his friends and school mates struggled to come to terms with the death of such a young and energeticman.However, his parents and brother and sister felt the unimaginable pain of his loss most deeply.Mum Donna admits to struggling to deal with the loss of her ’” handsome young son.Donna said: “As the second anniversary approaches of the death of my darling son Tiernan, it really just seems like yesterday.The Green family Tiernan with Mum Donna with youngest son Ryan Dad Stephen , Mise and Stefan“No mother or father should have to lay their child to rest.It should be the other way about.“Over these two years I have seen my family change and, when I say this, I mean we all have changed as people.I can honestly say our lives will never be the same again! “It’s weird how grief works on the mind.

My husband attends a meeting called Anam Cara and he finds it helps! “I find with me doing all my own asthma awareness and speaking out at dferent events- this, for me, ismy therapy this is what helps me -a mother who has lost her child.“We, as a family, lean off each other through the grief.“When I see my daughter is having a bad day I will speak to her and say THIS is ok. You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to have your quiet days when you don’t talk that much.“I know this is grief because I see it myself. I am the one who witnesses it. I am here for my family and they are here for me so we are all in this together.“I will still continue to raise as much awareness as possible and try and save as many lives as I can. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.“As long as I am living my son’s name will always live on through others,” said Donna.The familyhas raised around £, for ious charitiessince Tiernan passed away.The first year the family raised funds for Craigavon area hospital buying a special machine for respiratory help costing more than £k.They also raised cash to renovate the Family Room at the hospital with Tiernan’s plaque and new furniture and a TV.Last year they raised money for Anam Cara - a counselling service for families suffering from grief.Stephen attends Anam Cara regularly and it has helped him deal with the intense grief he felt at the loss of his son. Indeed he has become so close to the group that the organisation has asked him to become a spokesperson for them.Donna has dealt with her grief by raising the profile of asthma and campaigning for greater awareness on how to treat the illness so other families don’t have to go through a similar dreadful tragedy.“I have been getting messages from people across the country, thanking me for helping to save their son’s le or even thank you for saving my own le.It’s unreal.“It has brought me great comfort knowing that I have helped,” she said.The family also have organised a truck run over the past two years and are planning another this May. It has raised thousands of pounds.However, on this second anniversary, the Green family will remain close to each other, helping each other deal with the loss of such a beloved son and brother.If you would like more support and information on Asthma, please check out the websitewww.asthma.org.uk get-involved campaigns government northern-ireland If you need help with grief you can contact Anam Cara via their website www.anamcara.ietry catch            ..

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.

The A will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.” Gil West, Delta’s chief operating officer, said: “These additional A aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade. “We look forward to taking our first A- in  at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"outlook  uncertain times may lead to a business downturn","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Its already the New Year and economist John Simpson examines whats facing the Northern Ireland business community in the next  months The early weeks and months of  pose more dficult prospects for managing the economy and maintaining and boosting business continuity than key decision makers would either wish for or normally expect. In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
