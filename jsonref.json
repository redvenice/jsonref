Liz and I have been friends for a couple of years. A few months ago the stars seemed to align. We were both out of relationships, both believing that we were destined to be alone for the rest of our lives,’ he writes.‘But Liz has had strong feelings for me for years and kept those under wraps. A few weeks ago she revealed them to me and we’ve found an incredible love here ... We’re madly in love and planning our future together so, watch this space. We’re in the throes of introducing all our friends to each other.’         The object of Elizabeth Gilbert\u0027s affections is British photographer Simon MacArthur, 60, who was for years one of Rayya’s closest friends and a former flatmateBorn in Claverham, Bristol, New York-based documentary photographer and ‘environmental portraitist’ Mr MacArthur describes himself on his website as ‘a globetrotter, intensely curious about the way the world works and how best to pass on that curiosity to others — always looking for what’s around the next corner’.He continues: ‘A friend told me my photos have all the hallmarks of a humanist. I think it fits. I am an ardent animal rights advocate and avid scuba er, campaigning for the end of the use of plastics that are devastating oceanic life.’A graduate of Gwent College of Art and Design in Newport, South Wales, he has travelled the world capturing arresting images of people and nature in black and white. His subjects range from Welsh dry dock welders to fishermen in Mombasa.‘Why do I shoot solely in monochrome? The answer is because I want my work stripped bare of everything but cause and emotion,’ he writes. ‘As an emotive human being, I need to feel what I’m shooting, to feel as though I’m almost an integral part of everything I shoot ... ideally, interacting with my subject, in their skin.’As for Miss Gilbert, in her Instagram post presenting her new sweetheart, she offers the following advice to others mourning a loved one — it’s OK to fall in love and feel like a ‘dumb and crazy and excited and insecure’ 16-year-old again in middle age.‘Do not let your gorgeous loyalty to the deceased stop you from experiencing the marvels and terrors of your short, mortal, precious life. It’s OK to live, and to love.’         Born in Claverham, Bristol, New York-based documentary photographer and ‘environmental portraitist’ Mr MacArthur (left) describes himself on his website as ‘a globetrotter, intensely curious about the way the world works in how best to pass on that curiosity to others — always looking for what’s around the next corner\u0027Certainly the intertwined lives of these three New Yorkers — who for years were nothing more than just good friends — would make a remarkable third memoir for Gilbert, whose follow-up to Eat Pray Love was called Committed and explored her ambivalence towards marriage.You could argue it has all the hallmarks of another Hollywood blockbuster, sequel perhaps to the 2010 film adaptation of Gilbert’s bestseller (it’s been translated into 30 languages) starring Julia Roberts as Gilbert and Spanish actor Javier Bardem as ‘Felipe’.But will this new romance give Elizabeth Gilbert’s fans the neat happy ending they thought she’d found with Brazilian gem trader Jose Nunes, settling down to married life in a $1 million dollar Italianate Victorian mini-estate in the artsy, rural village of Frenchtown, New Jersey? For Gilbert’s voyage of self-discovery captured the zeitgeist. Described as ‘a Shirley Valentine for the yoga and quinoa generation’ and compared to Sex And The City’s Carrie Bradshaw ‘cut loose from New York’, Gilbert’s story struck a chord with women dreaming of escape.Some followed in her exotic footsteps, enjoying pizza in Italy (Eat), finding spiritual enlightenment in Indian ashrams (Pray) before travelling on to Indonesia hopefully to fall into the arms of their own sexy ‘Felipe’ under the Banyan trees of Bali (Love).Raised on a Christmas tree farm in Connecticut, Gilbert was a moderately successful writer when, aged 34 and reeling from a painful orce, she set off on her solo odyssey across three continents to try to make sense of her life.         Gilbert and Elias held a non-legally binding commitment ceremony in New York prior to her death. Gilbert and Elias had been best friends for years but their relationship turned romantic after the cancer diagnosisWriting on the tenth anniversary of the bestseller which turned her into a multi-millionaire, Miss Gilbert wrote: ‘The woman who went on this trip was exceedingly lucky …Who has 12 free months to spare, just to kick around the globe? Who has the freedom or the money?’She continued: ‘One of the reasons I was so free that year was because I was such a mess. It was easy for me to leave everything behind because I didn’t have much to leave behind.‘I had no property because I’d lost it all in my orce. I had no romantic relationships, because I’d exploded them. I had no job because I’d quit. Everything was in turmoil, everything was in flux and I was so bloody sad.’Reflecting on the tangled love life which triggered the odyssey, Gilbert wrote in 2015 with disarming honesty about her past romantic failings, under the heading Confessions Of A Seduction Addict.‘Seduction was never a casual sport for me it was more like a heist, adrenalising and urgent. I would plan the heist for months, scouting out the target, looking for unguarded entries,’ she wrote.‘Then I would break into his deepest vault, steal all the emotional currency and spend it on myself. If the man was already involved in a committed relationship, I knew that I didn’t need to be prettier or better than his existing girlfriend I just needed to be different.         Gilbert announced in September 2016 that her marriage was over and that she’d found love with her best friend of 17 years —Rayya Elias — a musician, writer, film maker, recovered drug addict, ex-punk rocker and former hairdresser whom she’d first met when Elias staged an ‘intervention’ on Gilbert’s hair (Above: the pair pictured together in 2014)‘The trick was to study the other woman and to become her opposite, thereby positioning myself to this man as a sparkling alternative to his regular life.’Although Miss Gilbert set off on her voyage, swearing she will ‘never, ever, under any circumstance, marry again’, in 2007 she did marry her exotic, older lover ‘Felipe’, Jose Nunes.Together they set up an Asian imports emporium in New York called Two Buttons, and for ten years the glamorous couple seemed blissfully happy, living in Frenchtown’s most expensive house — built for New Jersey’s first native-born governor. ‘My marriage has been pretty f****** nice. Pretty steady,’ she said shortly before their shock break-up.‘I always think about how, at the very beginning, he said: “Can you please be gentle with me?”, and I remember thinking: “You, sir, have come to the right place.” ’In a long Facebook message to her fans, Gilbert announced in September 2016 that her marriage was over and that she’d found love with her best friend of 17 years —Rayya Elias — a musician, writer, film maker, recovered drug addict, ex-punk rocker and former hairdresser whom she’d first met when Elias staged an ‘intervention’ on Gilbert’s hair.‘Rayya and I are together. I love her and she loves me,’ wrote Gilbert, adding that she realised the depth of her feeling for Rayya only when her best friend was diagnosed with pancreatic and liver cancer.‘Something happened to my heart and mind in the days and weeks following Rayya’s diagnosis,’ she continued. ‘Death — or the prospect of death — has a way of clearing away everything that is not real and, in that stark and utter realness, I was faced with this truth: I do not merely love Rayya I am in love with Rayya. And I have no more time for denying that truth.’Jose Nunes has never spoken of his orce from Gilbert. Their Frenchtown mansion was listed for sale for $999,000 dollars, the New York shop sold and last October the couple’s two-bedroom apartment on a Wellness resort in Miami, Florida was listed for sale for $2.3 million dollars.In an interview with a lesbian magazine about inspiring same-sex couples, Rayya Elias revealed she and Gilbert were ‘very happily not married’ but had gone through a non-legally-binding ceremony of their commitment to one another.Describing their ‘slow burn of passion’ after ‘almost two decades of the deepest foundational friendship you could ever imagine’, Rayya said: ‘It took a long time. Then I was diagnosed with cancer, and that did it. There was no more time to waste. The truth had to be spoken.’After Rayya’s death in January 2018, Elizabeth Gilbert posted this tribute: ‘She was my love, my heart, my best friend, my teacher, my rebel, my angel, my protector, my challenger, my partner, my muse, my wizard, my surprise, my gift, my comet, my liberator, my rock star … and my baby.‘I loved you so much, Rayya. Thank you for letting me walk with you right to the edge of the river. It has been the greatest honour of my life. I would tell you to rest in peace, but I know you always found peace boring. May you rest in excitement. I will always love you.’Today, a happy new chapter now appears to be opening for Elizabeth Gilbert — with the friend of the late best friend whom they both loved.No doubt, her fans will be eagerly awaiting her next surprise.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Who Tory defector Nick Boles","story":"Share this article During the referendum he backed Remain, saying last year he \u0027didn\u0027t believe that leaving the EU was worth the hassle\u0027. Nonetheless he voted to trigger Article 50, having to be wheeled from his hospital bed to cast the vote despite undergoing chemotherapy treatment.  He is gay and married to Israeli-born husband Shay Meshulam, who is 20 years younger than him. As a minister he said he had \u0027played a part in persuading David Cameron\u0027 to back the introduction of same-sex marriage. \u0027I have wanted my party to be guided by liberal instincts, and inspired by progressive goals while also drawing on a deep well of conservative pragmatism and common sense,\u0027 he said recently.               Nick Boles is wheeled from his hospital bed to vote for Article 50 in 2017 (left) and poses outside Downing Street in 2015 (right) when he was a minister under David Cameron However he has found himself at odds with the Tory Government in recent months. In January he broke with the Tory front bench to champion a Labour-backed amendment, calling for Brexit to be delayed until 2020. He also spearheaded initial backbench efforts to seize control of Commons business in order to stop a No Deal departure. Two weeks ago he said he would not stand for re-election after efforts by local activists in the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association to dump him as the party’s candidate. His allies have included fellow Remainer Amber Rudd, who called him a \u0027typically thoughtful\u0027 MP after he quit his local party.  Monday night\u0027s votes were the final straw as Mr Boles declared his party had become \u0027incapable of compromise\u0027. He will now sit on the opposition benches alongside other parties including Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and The Independent Group.          "},{"url":null,"title":"Royal Marines kitted 340 000 Iron Man style jet suits","story":"Share this article          Mr Williamson was briefed on several products that could be bought by the military at QinetiQ’s Portsdown Technology Park         Royal Navy personel demonstrating their underwater drone during a visit to the Portsdown Technology Park in Portsmouth         Mr Williamson announced the service would be handed £75million for mine-hunting robots and for a new unit called NavyX that will draw in experts to identify cutting-edge drone equipmentWhile not as slick as the suits worn by Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr in the superhero movies, the effect was the similar.Mr Wilson said the product, built by start-up firm Gravity, was ‘like riding a bike’.

If MPs have backed a customs union, Mrs May will have to decide whether to accept a policy opposed by the vast majority of Tory MPs. If she agrees, the issue could tear the party apart. If she refuses, it would result in a constitutional stand-off that could spark an election. Downing Street fears that she could face a Cabinet walkout regardless of what she decides.           Theresa May faces a battle to keep control of Brexit as MPs vote on alternatives to her deal toniWednesday: Sir Oliver Letwin has indicated he will try to seize control of the Commons agenda again to pursue his soft Brexit plan. If Monday\u0027s votes were inconclusive, they could be held again, possibly using preferential voting to reduce the options to one. If Monday night\u0027s vote produced a solution, but Mrs May refused to adopt it, Parliament could legislate in a bid to force her hand.Thursday: Allies of the PM have the day pencilled in for a possible fourth attempt to get her deal through the Commons. They believe that, with the majority against her coming down from 230 to 149 then to 58 last week, they have momentum on their side. Ministers are considering an unprecedented parliamentary \u0027run off\u0027 pitting Mrs May\u0027s deal against the soft Brexit option chosen by MPs in the hope of focusing the minds of Tory eurosceptics.What happens next? What will the EU do next?  An emergency summit will be held on April 10. Britain can use this to ask for a longer delay to Brexit - perhaps to the end of the year or even longer.Mrs May has told MPs a long delay will mean holding European Parliament elections on May 22.  What is No 10\u0027s plan? Mrs May is ploughing on for now. Downing Street is insistent the deal remains the best way of securing an orderly Brexit and appears set on another vote at some point.  No 10 may now consider whether to call a snap general election if MPs try to pass laws to force May to pursue their option next week. Will May go for a long extension or No Deal? Nobody knows for certain. The Prime Minister has publicly ruled out personally going for a long extension but also admitted Parliament will rule out No Deal.Will May resign now her deal has failed again? Again, nobody knows for sure. Her announcement on Wednesday night that she would stand down was contingent on the deal passing.In practice, it drained Mrs May of all remaining political capital. Most in Westminster think her Premiership is over within weeks at the latest. As her deal folded for a third time on Friday, she faced immediate calls from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn so stand down with instant effect. What is clear is there is already a fight underway for the Tory leadership.  Does is all mean there will be an election?Probably, at some point. The Commons is deadlocked and the Government has no functional majority. While the Fixed Term Parliaments Act means the Government can stumble on, it will become increasingly powerless.Mrs May could try to call one herself or, assuming she stands down, her successor could do so.  Would May lead the Tories into an early election? Unlikely. Having admitted to her party she would go if the deal passes, Mrs May\u0027s political career is doomed.While there is no procedural way to remove her, a withdrawal of political support from the Cabinet or Tory HQ would probably finish her even if she wanted to stay.    How is an election called? When would it be? Because of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act passed by the coalition, the Prime Minister can no longer simply ask the Queen to dissolve the Commons and call an election. There are two procedures instead.First - and this is what happened in 2017 - the Government can table a motion in the Commons calling for an early election. Crucially, this can only pass with a two-thirds majority of MPs - meaning either of the main parties can block it.Second an election is called if the Government loses a vote of no confidence and no new administration can be built within 14 days.In practice, this is can only happen if Tory rebels vote with Mr Corbyn - a move that would end the career of any Conservative MP who took the step. An election takes a bare minimum of five weeks from start to finish and it would take a week or two to get to the shut down of Parliament, known as dissolution - putting the earliest possible polling day around mid to late May. If the Tories hold a leadership election first it probably pushes any election out to late June at the earliest.  Why do people say there has to be an election? The question of whether to call an election finally reached the Cabinet last week.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay warned the rejection of Mrs May\u0027s deal would set in train a series of events that will lead to a softer Brexit - meaning an election because so many MPs will have to break manifesto promises. MPs voting to seize control of Brexit from ministers has only fuelldd the demands.   Labour has been calling for a new vote for months, insisting the Government has failed to deliver Brexit.Mr Corbyn called a vote of no confidence in the Government in January insisting the failure of the first meaningful vote showed Mrs May\u0027s administration was doomed. He lost but the calls did not go away. Brexiteers have joined the demands in recent days as Parliament wrestles with Brexit and amid fears among hardliners promises made by both main parties at the last election will be broken - specifically on leaving the Customs Union and Single Market. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen wants Mrs May replaced with a Brexiteer. He believes it would push Remain Tories out of the party and then allow a snap election with more Eurosceptic candidates wearing blue rosettes.What might happen? Both main parties will have to write a manifesto - including a position on Brexit. Both parties are deeply split - in many cases between inidual MPs and their local activists.Under Mrs May, the Tories presumably try to start with the deal. But it is loathed by dozens of current Tory MPs who want a harder Brexit and hated even more by grassroots Tory members. Shifting Tory policy on Brexit to the right would alienate the majority of current MPs who voted to Remain.Labour has similar splits. Many of Labour\u0027s MPs and activists want Mr Corbyn to commit to putting Brexit to a second referendum - most with a view to cancelling it. Mr Corbyn is a veteran Eurosceptic and millions of people who voted Leave in 2016 backed Labour in 2017. The splits set the stage for a bitter and chaotic election. The outcome is highly unpredictable - the Tories start in front but are probably more ided on the main question facing the country.Labour is behind but knows it made dramatic gains in the polls in the last election with its promises of vastly higher public spending. Neither side can forecast what impact new political forces might wield over the election or how any public anger over the Brexit stalemate could play out.It could swing the result in favour of one of the main parties or a new force. Or an election campaign that takes months, costs millions of pounds could still end up in a hung Parliament and continued stalemate.

Photograph: iStockThe medical files of more than 7,500 children are being reviewed in an unprecedented official audit prompted by allegations that children were “damaged” by orthodontic services in the greater Dublin area.Some of the patients affected by the review may have to be recalled well over a decade after their orthodontic work was performed, the Health Service Executive has indicated.It is alleged some children had braces left in for longer than intended – in some cases over a year – leading to damage to the surface of their teeth. Other children allegedly suffered wires protruding into their gums while some had to get false teeth because excessive spaces were created when specialist appliances were left in place too long.News of the review comes as the Department of Health prepares a long-delayed oral health policy this week. The plan is expected to propose rolling out free dental care to children from 2020, to include dental exams, fillings, emergency work, extractions and orthodontics.However, dentists say there was no meaningful consultation with the profession in the drawing up of the plans and no talks have taken place about the provision of the proposed new services.Critical reportThe audit of orthodontic services was begun in 2015 after the HSE received a highly critical report commissioned from two UK experts into the allegations that children’s teeth were damaged by HSE orthodontic services more than a decade previously.“Due to the scale of the audit and the requirements for specialist staff and resources, the timeline has been protracted, however this work is now nearing its completion,” the HSE said this week.“While it is regrettable that this work has taken so long to progress, the priority of the HSE at all times has been for a robust audit on which to base any further action required.”The UK review, carried out between 2012 and 2015, has never been published. Three years ago, The  sought a copy under freedom of information but this request was refused. The HSE said it was “not yet finalised for publication” and was with its lawyers.Last week, a spokeswoman said it was “in effect” a scoping report commissioned to advise the HSE on what actions to take if there was a risk of harm to patients.“The HSE cannot, as a matter of course, commit to the publication or otherwise of such reports prior to their completion, as the benefits of publication must be balanced with the requirement for patient confidentiality, and our obligation to afford natural justice to all other parties concerned.”Patient recallWhen the audit was complete, a serious incident management team would consider the results to determine if a recall of any patient was required and to co-ordinate open disclosure as necessary, she said.The allegations relate to the period 1999-2002, meaning all the children affected would now be adults.Retired consultant orthodontist Ted McNamara, who made the original complaint, said it was disappointing the HSE had still not published the review completed in 2015.“I was complaining for up to 14 years about damage to children’s teeth. It was obvious there was a problem, but no one did anything about it for years.”In 2007, a Department of Health official told the Oireachtas health committee no complaints had been made about orthodontic services to the Minister for Health, the HSE or the Dental Council."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Chase lasted almost an hour before man was detained by garda\u0026iacute just outside PortlaoiseMinister says calls for his resignation after policing comments are matter for the TaoiseachOne in four people know of an autistic person among their friends, research revealsMediterranean rescue mission tested training and boosted payExplainer: Persistence of common external tariffs may run counter to reason for leavingTaoiseach to discuss EU single market and open Border with Macron and MerkelParents and sons accepted under family reunification but daughter refused due to ageAudit acts on allegations that children\u0026rsquos teeth were damaged by HSE orthodontic servicesCost of corrective action poses challenges for owners\u0026rsquo management firmsCalls for McGrath to resign after claiming drink-driving checks were \u0026lsquoover the top\u0026rsquoDrivers crossing into Northern Ireland without correct documentation risk finesMany rural areas could lose local access to cash because of such attacks, warns Retail NIActivist calls for UK to clarify changes to law, says it creates \u0026lsquotwo tiers of Irish citizens\u0026rsquoLocal authority advocating \u0026lsquoVienna model\u0026rsquo, which is a move away from home ownershipResponding to NGO survey, spokesman says airline Europe\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquogreenest and cleanest\u0026rsquoUS aircraft lessor CAF claims Peel Aviation has not repaid loan for purchase of luxury jetCrews battled blaze in the Killarney National Park for more than 13 hours"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846729.1554199092!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"finian mcgrath apologises again for major mistake","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath has apologised to gardaí and families of drink-driving road crash victims.  Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsMinister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath has reiterated his apology for comments he withdrew about ‘political policing’ just hours after he defended them and called for the Garda Commissioner to address the issue.In his first public appearance since his original remarks were quoted in the Sunday Independent, in which he said the implementation of controversial drink-driving laws by gardaí had been “really over the top” and suggested there was an “agenda” within the force to damage the Government.He claimed to have received complaints about gardaí breathalysing parents picking up their children from school and on the way to Mass on Sunday mornings.Speaking on Tuesday morning at an event to mark World Autism Day, Mr McGrath said: “It was a major mistake by me. I apologise to the drink-driving road crash victims. I have issued an apology. Of course I have apologised to the gardaí as well. It was an error in a very broad ranging interview. I fully accept responsibility.“I apologise wholeheartedly and I also want to reassure the families that I supported the legislation and I defended the minister responsible at the time against a lot of critics.”Asked whether he should heed calls for his resignation, Mr McGrath said: “The only people I listen to and I listen to very very carefully, I listen to the people I caused hurt to. “And I accept responsibility, I made a mistake and I apologise. The question of resignation, that’s a matter for the Taoiseach. From my point of view, I’ve apologised, I’ve been up front, I made a mistake in the interview, and that’s exactly it, that’s the end of it.”Asked if he still believed the people who brought the allegations to his intention in the first place, Mr McGrath said: “People are entitled to make their views known and that’s their views but I’m not going to make any more comment. thanks very much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"number of drink drivers caught the morning after is on the rise","story":"Just 69 motorists were caught over the drink-driving limit “the morning after” since the beginning of the year, latest Garda figures show.Last month, the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau said 695 people were caught drink-driving in January this year, up 16 per cent on the 597 caught during the same month last year.And a newly released breakdown of the figures shows 10 per cent of those over the limit were detected between the hours of 6am and midday.This is up from the 9 per cent found to be still intoxicated during the morning for the same period in 2018.The data comes as Minister of State Finian McGrath faced calls to resign after claiming gardaí are carrying out “over-the-top” drink-driving checks because they oppose new road safety laws.Mr McGrath, a so-called super junior minister who sits at the Cabinet, last night issued another apology for his comments, made in an interview with the Sunday Independent.“I am aware that my comments regarding the gardaí and drink-driving have caused hurt to families and victims who continue to suffer the consequences of drink-driving,” the latest statement said.“It was never my intention to cause pain and I wish to unreservedly apologise to them and also to our gardaí.“Families and victims suffering the aftermath of drink-driving have always been my priority. I voted for and fully support the legislation which automatically disqualifies any motorist found to have consumed alcohol. I also supported the Government Minister who brought this vital legislation forward even though he was criticised from some quarters. I will continue to support all road safety initiatives and measures.”The Minister who brought forward the reforms was Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Mr McGrath’s colleague in the Independent Alliance.Public scepticismFormer Garda chief superintendent John O’Brien said he could understand public scepticism about Garda checkpoints for drink-driving because of past issues with inflated figures, but he said checkpoints were important.He said enforcement needed to be done with a degree of sensitivity and that everything had to be done to improve road safety.Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton defended Mr McGrath.“He is a very passionate person. I do have full confidence in him. He has a particular way of working.“He was man enough to admit that he was wrong and to express confidence in the Garda and that he was wrong to say this.“What he said requires an apology. All of us in our game could make a slip, then have to come along and withdraw.”The Garda Representative Association (GRA) welcomed Mr McGrath’s withdrawal of his comments.“Our members take their political independence very seriously and regard it as a key reason gardaí command such a high level of public support,” it said in a statement.“The GRA welcomes Minister McGrath’s acknowledgement that his charges have no basis and will not be commenting further on this matter at this time.”* This text has been amended. An earlier version reported that 69 drivers were over the limit in January.

File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe The UK government is under pressure to clarify immigration rules that human rights activists say undermine the rights of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, said changes in UK immigration laws treating people in Northern Ireland automatically as British citizens (or British subjects) “goes against the grain” of the 1998 agreement underpinning the Northern Irish peace process.He was referring to the changes to immigration rules published on March 7th but highlighted this week by citizens’ rights campaigner Emma DeSouza, a Northern Ireland-born Irish citizen embroiled in a lengthy appeals process after her US-born husband’s application for residence was rejected.The UK changed the definition of a European Economic Area national in the rules last month stipulating that dual British nationals who are British by birth will not be considered an EEA national in the UK.Ms DeSouza said the change reaffirmed “a worrying trend” of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens are going to be “among the only EU citizens within the UK unable to access their EU rights and entitlements”.She argues that this is significant because the UK government has taken the position that all people of Northern Ireland are British by birth under the British Nationality Act 1981, a presupposition that, she says, “goes against the Good Friday Agreement right to be Irish or British or both as you so choose”.The Co Derry woman says that Irish citizens or dual Irish-British citizens in Northern Ireland cannot apply for “settled status” as EU nationals in the UK after Brexit. If they could, this would, under the UK’s proposed orce deal, provide them with “a legal security blanket” to protect their rights.“So what is happening is the government is imposing blanket British citizenship on the people of Northern Ireland and removing our access to EU rights through this process,” she said.“This creates in essence two tiers of Irish citizens: those that can retain their EU rights and those that can’t.”‘Hiding contradictions’The Department of Foreign Affairs said the Government was continuing to engage with the UK Government “to ensure that the important citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are upheld in all relevant policy areas and in all scenarios.”Ms DeSouza’s husband applied to live in Northern Ireland in 2015 as the family member of an EEA national living in the UK.The UK Home Office initially refused the application on the basis that his Co Derry-based wife applied for the visa as an Irish national, which as a dual citizen disqualified her.Her husband challenged the decision, arguing that his wife had the right to be treated as an Irish citizen under the 1998 agreement and was exercising her freedom-of-movement right as an EU citizen.The couple won but the Home Office is appealing the decision and a hearing has been delayed until the UK is due to leave the EU. Ms DeSouza fears further changes with Brexit, particularly in light of the trend reflected in the new immigration rules that she noticed in recent days.Mr Allamby called on the UK government to outline further details of the review British prime minister Theresa May promised on the identity rights of citizens when she visited Belfast in February.“We would call on the government to issue the terms of reference and a timetable for the review as quickly as possible in order to resolve questions of family reunion in Emma DeSouza and other cases,” he said.Brian Gormally, director of Northern Irish human rights group Committee on the Administration of Justice, said that Brexit has opened up “a legal reality” that the UK has not legislated to protect the rights of Northern Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.“Brexit has peeled away some things that have been hiding contradictions in British law relating to the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.Daniel McCrossan MLA, the SDLP’s Brexit spokesman, called on the UK government to address the immigration rules and “commit to conforming with the spirit and letter of the Good Friday Agreement”.“These rules, which redefine EEA citizenship as contradictory to British citizenship, and further define those born in the North as automatically British, fly in the face of the guarantee that all those born here can identify as Irish, British or both,” he said.Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846123.1554146179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar set to argue for long extension of brexit negotiating period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘No one should under-estimate the difficulties that a no-deal will present, for all of us.’  Photograph: Brian Lawless PA Wire Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to make the case for a long extension of the Brexit negotiating period when he meets French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday and German chancellor Angela Merkel in Dublin on Thursday.Mr Varadkar will meet Mr Macron in the Elysee Palace, and is expected to argue for a long extension of the Article 50 negotiating period if one is needed. However, Government sources rejected claims that the Taoiseach is under pressure from Europe’s two most powerful leaders to outline how Ireland will deal with the Border if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.It was acknowledged the meetings in the coming days will, among other issues, see Mr Varadkar discuss how to protect the EU single market and keep the Border open in a no-deal Brexit scenario. EU sources said this could include checks, in customs for example, away from the Border – such as in places of origin or destination, or at locations such as Dublin Port. Tánaiste Simon Coveney also repeated that the Government would seek to hold the UK to its commitment of December 2017 to maintain regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic to keep the Border open. Mr Varadkar last week said the EU should be open to a long extension “should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit and put back on the table options previously ruled out”.Brexit day EU leaders have set Friday week as Brexit day if the UK does not ratify the Withdrawal Agreement. However, they also left the door open to a longer extension of Article 50, delaying the UK’s exit, if the UK proposes another way forward.In advance of his meeting with Mr Macron, Mr Varadkar said in a statement that he was “keen to discuss the possible scenarios arising from this week, particularly how the European Council should respond to a request for another extension, should there be one, and ongoing efforts to secure ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement”.“As I have indicated, it is now up to the UK to show how it plans to proceed and avoid a no-deal scenario. We are preparing for all outcomes, and have prepared intensively for a no-deal. But no one should under-estimate the difficulties that a no-deal will present, for all of us.”Sources said Mr Macron had concerns about the potential damaging effect that the UK taking part in European Parliament elections, a prerequisite for an extension past May 22nd, could have on the EU.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier said it ‘would be the responsibility’ of the UK government to choose between leaving without an agreement or seeking an extension. Photograph: Slawomir KaminskiAgencja GazetaReuters Elaborate and extensive checks on goods and animals crossing the Irish Border will be necessary in a no-deal scenario, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated on Tuesday. But where such checks will be remains unclear.Speaking at a Brussels think-tank, he said, “we need to find the way somewhere to implement the checks. We’re working with Irish Government to know where we can apply these checks.”“We have to implement everywhere, at each and every external border of the EU three types of controls to protect consumers, food security, animal disease, to protect the budgets of the EU and national budgets, so the fiscal controls for VAT and customs controls, and serve to protect businesses against counterfeiting and ensure the goods entering the EU are meeting standards.“This is the pre-condition to avoid any kind of controls inside the single market. That’s why we need to find the way somewhere to implement the checks. We’re working with the Irish Government to know where we can apply these checks but I will not elaborate on this point today.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will have talks with French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday, and with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Dublin on Thursday, with plans to protect the single market up for discussion.Mr Barnier echoed comments on Monday by the European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt warning that British MPs were facing a last chance to break the deadlock.Three optionsHe warned that any demand from London for a long extension would have to be justified to EU leaders before they would agree to it. “Such an extension would carry significant risks for the EU, therefore a strong justification would be needed,” he said, specifying that would have to mean a commitment to a new approach.There might be three options: “A new political process, I don’t know what kind of process we’ll see, that gets a majority. The second one would be organising a new referendum and the third one would be national elections. It could be a justification for a long extension of the negotiation to give the UK time for one of these three options.”He reiterated that the withdrawal agreement remains the only deal on the table. “If the UK still wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner, this agreement is and will be the only one. The only way to avoid a no-deal Brexit is and will be through a positive majority.“There is a possibility of a successful meaningful vote in the coming days. Still the House of Commons did not manage to find a majority again last night in its second round of indicative votes. We will continue to follow how the process unfolds in the UK.”“We always said we can accept a customs union or our relationship along the style of the Norway model. The political declaration can accommodate this today. It leaves the door open for a variety of outcomes. We’re prepared to rework the political declaration as long as the fundamental principles of the EU are accepted,” he said.“If UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour in the coming days only two options remain. Leaving without an agreement or requesting a longer extension of the article 50 period. It would be the responsibility of the UK government to choose between these two options.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His customs union proposal was rejected by 276 votes to 273. Photograph:  Jessica TaylorUK Parliament via ReutersWhat were the results?The motion on a customs union, put forward by the Tory veteran Ken Clarke, lost by 273 votes in favour to 276 against. This was a slight improvement: the majority against the plan last week was six. A cross-party motion for a “common market 2.0” fell by 21 votes (261 to 282) a call for any final deal to be put to a referendum lost by 280 to 292 and a plan to give MPs the power to extend Brexit, or at least choose between no deal or revoking article 50, lost by 191 to 292.Were there any surprises?Yes and no. There had been no definitive expectations of any measure reaching a majority, but proponents of the customs union and common market 2.0 plans had been hopeful – the former because the margin of defeat had been so small last time, the latter because Labour changed its stance to whip in favour of the idea.What sunk the two close-run plans?In the customs union vote, joining the vast majority of Conservatives in the no lobby were a mix of people for whom the plan was not Brexity enough (the DUP, some Labour leavers) and those for whom it was too hard a departure (the Lib Dems, the Independent Group). Some remain-minded MPs abstained.The common market 2.0 plan suffered from a similar mix of opponents, and worries about the idea of not ending freedom of movement led 25 Labour MPs to defy the whip, mainly those in leave-voting areas. Another 33 Labour MPs abstained.Are MPs ever going to agree on anything?Who knows? The expectation had been that a looming no-deal departure – now due in 11 days’ time – would focus minds, build bonds and prompt compromises. But that has yet to happen. Focus will now turn to a possible third round of indicative votes, perhaps on Wednesday. Jeremy Corbyn, responding to the results in the Commons, called for this course of action, saying that if it was “good enough for the PM to have three chance at her deal”, then the same should go for MPs.Does this mean Theresa May’s plan is back on?It never went away, at least not as far as the government is concerned. Despite having put the deal (or in the last case, half the deal) to the Commons three times and losing by 230, 149 and 58 votes respectively, it seems likely MPs will get a fourth go later this week. Responding to the results, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said May’s plan was the only viable option left, given that the Commons had rejected leaving without a deal and cancelling Brexit. But with the DUP and Tory hardline Brexiters still adamant that they cannot back the plan, it still appears unlikely that it will pass.Who’s going to be most pleased by this?The MPs pushing the alternative plans are certainly not so chipper – the Tory Nick Boles resigned the party whip after his common market 2.0 plan was defeated, saying the government had refused to compromise.Theresa May could take grim pleasure from MPs trying to “seize control” of the Brexit process amid much criticism of her supposed incompetence and then proving just as unable to find a way through the weeds. She also now does not face the immediate choice that would have come from a positive vote for a softer Brexit: embrace this and lose half her cabinet or reject it and go for no deal, thus losing the other half. A couple of Brexit-minded MPs had even indicated that if May pushed for a customs union, they might vote with Labour on a no-confidence motion to bring down the government.But she still faces an intractable decision, a ticking clock, a mutinous party, an aghast British public and a frankly baffled EU. So what happens next?No timetable has yet been agreed. The cabinet is meeting on Tuesday morning for what will be a hugely important gathering, even by the standards of recent weeks and months. It seems we can then expect a new vote on May’s deal later in the week, and perhaps more indicative votes.Will this mean a long delay to Brexit, and UK participation in EU elections?Given parliament’s strong opposition to no deal, this is looking more likely. According to officials close to the Brexit negotiations in Brussels earlier in the day, the UK could still leave by May 22nd – the set departure date if May’s deal is passed – if the Commons orders Downing Street to negotiate a customs union. However, the Commons has not done this. – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Western lowland gorilla Kera, opens presents intended for her daughter Afia, in celebration of  her third birthday at Bristol Zoo GardensThe client relationship, and the conflicts of interest which abound, undermine the professional scepticism needed to deliver reliable, high-quality audits. Splitting audit from non-audit business would be a big step to boosting the culture of challenge needed to deliver high-quality audits.We must not wait for the next corporate collapse. Government and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension-holders and the public expect.Auditors have come in for criticism after a number of large companies have gone bust without the accountants who checked their books highlighting problems.The business committee also raised questions about the dominance of the big four which check the books of 97 per cent of Britain’s largest listed firms. The Business Committee recommends using joint audits for the most complicated cases. This would mean multiple accountants sharing work on a single company’s accounts.In addition, it wants to reduce the number of consecutive years a company can stay with the same auditor from 20 years to seven. After this there would be a cooling-off period of three years during which the auditor cannot offer consultancy services to the client. Some auditors have been accused of developing “cosy” relationships with certain clients that hampered their ability to properly scrutinise the management’s accounts. The committee also took aim at Britain’s fifth-largest accountancy firm Grant Thornton which audited cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Chief executive David Dunckley informed the Business Committee that it was not part of Grant Thornton’s role to look for fraud during its audit of the company.A £40m hole in Patisserie Valerie’s accounts was subsequently uncovered by forensic accountancy work carried out by a different firm.Ms Reeves said that “change in the audit market is long overdue”. The \u0027Big Four\u0027s\u0027 dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on.Our report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearCryptocurrency markets are\u0026nbspnotoriously volatile and it is difficult to pinpoint price swings to a specific incident.Some\u0026nbspmarket analysts suggest such a jump could help kick start more gains for bitcoin in the year leading up to its next ‘halvening’ – an event taking place every four years where the rewards for mining the digital currency are reduced by 50 per cent.Twitter boss Jack Dorsey buying $10,000 in bitcoin each week“Although there are no clear cut reasons for the sudden movement, it is reasonable to suggest that bitcoin has hit its bottom as we are almost 400 days away from the next halvening,” Danny Scott, chief executive of Isle of Man cryptocurrency exchange CoinCorner, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“This is price behaviour we have seen before previous halvenings and is something we believe to be an emerging pattern for bitcoin.”Breaking above the $4,200 price is also seen as significant by some cryptocurrency experts, who believe it could precede a positive price trend for bitcoin.Earlier this week, bitcoin analyst Simon Peters, who works for the online trading platform eToro, said that investors were “eagerly awaiting” to see if it broke above this price point.“Bitcoin has failed to break this ceiling so far in 2019, and therefore this price movement would be significant,” he said.“However, investors should hold their horses, as only once we’ve seen a break and, importantly, the price stays above $4,200, can people perhaps start to turn bullish for the long-term.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Humanity might be about to see a black hole for the first ever time.The announcement relates to the Event Horizon Telescope, the European Southern Observatory announced, which is said to have found its first result. That telescope has been capturing data for more than a decade in an attempt to take a photo of the edge of a black hole, the first time one would ever have been seen by human eyes.Scientists have been attempting to take images of\u0026nbspSagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole that lurks in the middle of our galaxy.Black holes are by their very nature impossible to see, since they swallow up all light and so make it impossible for any to reach us on Earth. While we can understand them because of the way they affect the space that surrounds them, they cannot actually be directly seen.Created with Sketch.Nasa finds flowing water on Mars - in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.But the telescope hopes to snap an image of the event horizon, or the point at their edge where light cannot escape. That has proved incredibly difficult, because of the dust and disruption that lurks on the far reaches of a black hole.Now astronomers are teasing the groundbreaking and incredibly important new breakthrough in that project, suggesting the work might be complete.Black hole discovered hiding behind gas cloud near centre of galaxyThe main press conference will take place on 10 April, in Brussels, at 3pm local central European time.

Britain’s continuing descent into a deep pit was all over his morning’s business and economic news.\u0026nbspTake the MarkitCIPS survey of manufacturing as your starter for ten. It was up at 55.1, against 52.1 the previous month, with anything above 50 constituting an expansion. That ought to be good news. Trouble is, it was driven by manufacturers racing to complete orders and stockpiling like it’s going out of fashion. You can expect it to fall back to earth with a hard bump as the process unwinds, even if MPs somehow manage to find a way out of the crisis.\u0026nbspCabinet minsters jockey for position ahead of key Brexit votes- liveEasyJet warns Brexit will mean weak summer salesJean-Claude Juncker warns EU\u0027s \u0027patience coming to an end\u0027 over BrexitThen there was EasyJet’s warning about “weaker demand” and “softer ticket prices” while reiterating that it should still more or less meet City expectations for the first half of the year. The shares slumped, losing more than 8 per cent of their value as the market took fright. \u0026nbspIt’s worth considering a point made by Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon in response. “The group isn’t doing a great deal wrong,” he opined, and he’s right. It isn’t.\u0026nbspIts struggles are partly down to higher fuel costs. That counts as more or less expected turbulence. Brexit, however, has left it flying into the middle of a violent hurricane.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just airlines that are faced with doing that as a result of the fools sitting around the cabinet table, whose sole current focus is in courting the ageing bigots in the Conservative\u0026nbspParty’s membership now that a leadership contest is looming.A case in point could be found in the form of Liz Truss, who is supposed to know a thing or two about the economy in her role as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\u0026nbspIf she does there was scant sign of it in her appearance on BBC Radio Four’s Brexit show, formerly known at the Today Programme, on which she declared she had “no fear” of no deal.\u0026nbspThe British Chambers of Commerce, the Institute of Directors, the CBI, the vast majority of their respective members, they all view that like a triple dose of the Exorcist in 3D.\u0026nbspBut Truss isn’t interest in interested in what people who understand economics, and how economies actually work, think or say. Nor are a depressingly large number of her colleagues who also like to burble on about their love for free trade. As for real people with real jobs and real mortgages? Who cares about them. The cabinet certainly doesn’t.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

There aren’t very many thoroughly good things about Britain at the moment but it is one of them.\u0026nbspThere’s a present today for those on it too, in the form of an inflation busting 4.9 per cent rise to £8.21 an hour.The celebrations will be somewhat muted, however. Bills are rising, and what the government now refers to as the National Living Wage is still a long way off from being a real living wage.\u0026nbspHermes couriers entitled to holiday pay and minimum wageIceland faces £21m HMRC bill for allegedly breaking minimum wage rulesOne in five young workers illegally paid less than minimum wageThe Living Wage Foundation, which operates a voluntary accreditation scheme for progressive minded employers, says you need to earn £9 an hour outside London to afford a decent basic standard of living.\u0026nbspMoreover, as I’ve written before Britain has a poor record when it comes to sustainably getting people out of low paid work\u0026nbspand into the sort of jobs which provide something better.\u0026nbspStill, it’s important that a floor has been created, and that it has been rising at a good clip (of late).\u0026nbspRemember how the critics, mostly on the right, wailed about how it would cost jobs and should be kept low. Erm…\u0026nbspThe battle between Labour and the Tories now is on who can increase it at the fastest rate. You could call it\u0026nbspa welcome war.\u0026nbspAnother positive to have emerged recently is the more aggressive approach to enforcement.\u0026nbspIt has helped that HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs has been given the funding to do the job. It’s said that where there’s a will there’s a way, but cash helps a lot more.\u0026nbspThere are still far too many people receiving less than they are entitled to, so it is to be hoped that this continues.\u0026nbspPerhaps the most important job as the wage enters its third decade is for the Government to properly get to grips with the problem of employers that seek to evade it not so much by breaking the rules but\u0026nbspby getting around them. I\u0027m talking here about the companies at the forefront of the so called ‘gig economy’.Back in 2017, Matthew Taylor, a former advisor to Tony Blair, made a series of recommendations for reform as part of a government sponsored review into modern working practices. They weren’t exactly radical, but they spent a long time in the Whitehall long grass nonetheless.\u0026nbspLegislation has lately promised, but it seems to have been sucked into the Brexit swamp along with everything else.\u0026nbspUnions have, meanwhile, taken the battle to the courts, through backing cases against firms like Deliveroo and Uber, whose workers frequently miss out on the protections offered by the minimum wage rules, and other employment legislation. Cases are\u0026nbspmostly working their way through appeals processes, but the early battles were won by the workers.\u0026nbspFor its part, the TUC is worried that gig firms may simply try to adapt their models in response to whatever\u0026nbspnew rules the government eventually comes up with, and whatever the courts finally say.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It’s initial assessment recommended a functional split between accountants’ auditing and consultancy arms but the MPs recommendations go further.Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves said: For the big firms, audits seem too often to be the route to milking the cash-cow of consultancy business.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Fire fighters attend to two police cars that were destroyed after being set on fire outside Goldthorpe police station in South Yorkshire in a suspected arson attackForensics teams work at the scene of a stabbing in Edmonton in London.

Western lowland gorilla Kera, opens presents intended for her daughter Afia, in celebration of  her third birthday at Bristol Zoo GardensThe client relationship, and the conflicts of interest which abound, undermine the professional scepticism needed to deliver reliable, high-quality audits. Splitting audit from non-audit business would be a big step to boosting the culture of challenge needed to deliver high-quality audits.We must not wait for the next corporate collapse. Government and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension-holders and the public expect.Auditors have come in for criticism after a number of large companies have gone bust without the accountants who checked their books highlighting problems.The business committee also raised questions about the dominance of the big four which check the books of 97 per cent of Britain’s largest listed firms. The Business Committee recommends using joint audits for the most complicated cases. This would mean multiple accountants sharing work on a single company’s accounts.In addition, it wants to reduce the number of consecutive years a company can stay with the same auditor from 20 years to seven. After this there would be a cooling-off period of three years during which the auditor cannot offer consultancy services to the client. Some auditors have been accused of developing “cosy” relationships with certain clients that hampered their ability to properly scrutinise the management’s accounts. The committee also took aim at Britain’s fifth-largest accountancy firm Grant Thornton which audited cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Chief executive David Dunckley informed the Business Committee that it was not part of Grant Thornton’s role to look for fraud during its audit of the company.A £40m hole in Patisserie Valerie’s accounts was subsequently uncovered by forensic accountancy work carried out by a different firm.Ms Reeves said that “change in the audit market is long overdue”. The \u0027Big Four\u0027s\u0027 dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on.Our report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But increasingly self-driving cars are just one of many innovations we are likely to see on our roads. The Government\u0027s new Future of Mobility: Urban Strategy sets out how it will plan for their introduction.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, it is important not to tarnish all home educators with the same brush.Created with Sketch.Thousands skip school to attend climate protest Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A girl wears a face mask and has a message written on her forehead that reads \u0027no planet B\u0027 during a demonstration against climate change in Brussels on Thursday 17 January 2019.

Indeed, many families are seeking to home educate because of mental health issues or bullying. These parents argue that their children feel less safe in mainstream education.Still, local authorities in England have been repeatedly calling for more powers to ensure that the rising number of children taught at home\u0026nbspreceive a good quality of education away from school.I introduced GCSEs in the 1980s – but now it’s time to scrap themThe latest call comes amid reports that some parents are being pressured by schools to home educate just before their children’s GCSE exams, leaving families without education provision during a vital period.In cases like this, the argument for more regulation is strong since it should\u0026nbspensure that pupils who are “off-rolled” – the process of moving pupils off a school register informally – do not miss out on education altogether.However, there is plainly a difference between parents who feel pressure to home educate in these circumstances, and families who have voluntarily opted out of the mainstream system with a plan in place.Many home educators argue that there is simply not enough quality provision in place for children with special educational needs at a time when schools and local authorities have faced cuts.The large rise in home schooling is a concern – but not because thousands of children are at risk or radicalisation or other dangers. The growth in home education is a worry because it reflects a significant dissatisfaction with the state school system.A register is a sticking plaster to a much bigger problem. Greater funding and reduced pressure over\u0026nbspexam results is needed to stem the flow\u0026nbspof children out of state school education. \u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped.

In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide1044 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugar1144 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active1344 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.1444 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.1544 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.1644 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.1744 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.1844 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1944 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues2044 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2144 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2244 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2844 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3444 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3544 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3644 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3744 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3844 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3944 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4044 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4144 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. How sugar might be inhaled is not made clear in the study, published in the journal Nature Immunology.Theoretically sugar could be “snorted” as a powder, but not “vaped”. When a sugar solution is heated the water evaporates while the sugar crystallises.The study in mice looked at specialised white blood cells called macrophages. These act as immune system “vacuum cleaners”, removing harmful organisms and debris.The Manchester team found that macrophages in the lungs need the right level of glucose “fuel” in order to function properly.Exposure to chemicals in the womb may reduce lung function in childrenToo much sugar stimulation led to inflammation of the type often associated with chronic conditions such as asthma.Lung inflammation is also linked to the potentially deadly effects of parasitic worm infections, a huge problem in Africa and Asia.The research suggests that blocking sugar receptors on lung macrophages could help suppress such diseases.On the other hand, stimulating the cells with more sugar might help the immune system fight off bronchial infections responsible for coughing fits and pneumonia.Prof MacDonald added: “Respiratory illnesses cause terrible suffering in both the developing and developed world.\u0026nbspHundreds of people are admitted to hospital every day in the UK with asthma attacks, while potentially deadly parasitic infections in the lungs are endemic across much of Africa and Asia.\u0026nbspThe idea that modifying glucose levels in the lungs could one day be a critical factor in treatment of these conditions is tremendously exciting.“Clearly we now need to study the impact of glucose on human lung macrophages.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But in respect to the rest of the country, Aasis are exiled: separated and subordinated.\u0026nbspMoved by the Aasis’ plight, I began to direct an exciting art project that would open the Aasis’ culture and build an awareness of their ancient traditions and self-resilience. I wanted to stimulate and record Aasi art, performance and story-making. The aim was to share their narratives around the world, with audiences who did not even know they existed.\u0026nbspThis is the story of my utopian idea, and its sheer catastrophe in practice.​Gandhi’s influence in India diminishesI leave home gladly, excited to be on my intrepid voyage to the wilderness in India, my favourite country. It is snowing so hard as I make my way to the airport. England has ground to a complete standstill, while\u0026nbspeveryone complains about the weather. The roads are slushy but the taxi\u0026nbspeventually arrives. At the airport I I think, ‘Here I am –\u0026nbspat the start of my adventure!’The plane, of course, is delayed for hours\u0026nbspbut eventually makes it to\u0026nbspBombay\u0026nbspwhere I am to catch a flight the next day.\u0026nbspI step out of the terminal and into\u0026nbspthe hot wave of blurred air as smog hits me. Knocked for six, I try to breathe. I sniff. I cough, and blink. Quite a change from the bitter “Beast from the East”\u0026nbspblizzard paralysing Blighty.\u0026nbspI’m so late the driver sent by my hotel is nowhere to be seen.Can’t be that hard to find a taxi, I think.\u0026nbspI follow signs and, a disorientated while later, I find myself in a multistory car park trying to book an Uber. Eventually I find my taxi and show him the address of my hotel, which is supposed to be very near to the airport (according to TripAdvisor), and easy to find (hence my booking). The driver does not seem very confident, or much more clued in than me – though that may be because the language gap. Down the back streets of Bombay, he gets lost and can’t find the hotel. He drops me off at a hotel that isn’t the one I had booked. Unknowing, I get out, pay him, and he drives off. I go to this hotel\u0026nbspbut it isn’t mine. They direct me. Lost, unsettled, confused, eventually, I find the hotel I booked.When I arrive, the manager (who speaks Pidgin English, thank goodness) tells me that they already cancelled my booking, since I had not appeared at 12pm. I’m late. And there will be no refund. What to do.\u0026nbspI tell him that I did not cancel my booking, my flight was delayed. There was no way to inform him that I would be late, since I was on a plane. He just says I have no booking. Goodbye.What are the options… I have no idea where I am, I could go back to that other hotel, but I can’t remember how to get there. I ask the manager if I can book another room. He says I can, but for a price three times the price of the original booking I had made (which he had cancelled). Plus, the price of the previous room of\u0026nbspwhich they had cancelled the booking. SCAM! Welcome to India. I argue with him for a bit, and try to barter the price, without much success. There is very little I can do. I’m too tired. I book the room, go there and fall asleep (completely exhausted).I awake at 3.30am the following morning, after an unsettled night, and have a cold shower (no hot water), make myself a coffee with my travel kettle. Refreshed, I go downstairs. The hotel taxi costs 5 times what the Uber cost yesterday. I try to argue, but no one speaks English. It’s like arguing with a brick wall. I leave, cross, in a hurry.But I get to the airport in one piece, and in plenty of time for my flight. I try to get money out of the ATM. It does not accept my card. The second machine is broken. The third refuses to give me any money. Buzz. A text message from my bank. Apparently, a considerable amount of money has been withdrawn from my bank account. Not me! Fraud. My account is blocked.\u0026nbspI have no access to money.The bank puts me on hold (expensive minutes)\u0026nbspbut there isn’t time to wait. It is about 1am in the UK anyway. Bank closed. What to do?I need to concentrate on the next stage of my imminent adventure. Waiting for the next flight, I meet one of my collaborators, Krishna, an art therapy student, who has come from Singapore to join me on this trip. We have an Indian breakfast (a version of the Indian staple,\u0026nbspcurry), plus coffee, and board the flight to Raipur.​There we meet\u0026nbspJaya, also an art therapist. We also meet our\u0026nbsplocal guru\u0026nbspwho is to\u0026nbsptake us around the Aasi villages. Almost ready, I’ll just get my bag.\u0026nbspI realise that my baggage is lost. Oh dear! I ask my friends to talk to the Jet Airways team and raise this problem. What am I going to do without all my stuff?Onwards. Either I’ll never see any of it again, or else they might somehow find it, in which case it will have to wait here until I return to Raipur. Anyway, I have my medication, my phone, my bank card (which isn’t working). I’ll survive.We leave the airport and begin a five-hour cab journey\u0026nbspto Kondagaon, the town where we will base ourselves during our visits to five Aasi villages in this area. In Kondagaon, we stay in a hotel. I share a room with Jaya, who very kindly lends me some of her clothes. No matter that I resemble a mountain of lead beneath a corpuscular tent, these clothes are very pretty. Indian chic (if pasty, unkempt, above my white-cum-blue pallor).Practical difficulties arise: who pays the bills, when my card is blocked? What to do… I ring my bank\u0026nbspbut the problem of sourcing money persists.For dinner, us comrades go to the local restaurant (which we visit three times a day, every day, during our odyssey around Kondagaon). We always have the same thing: for dinner and lunch there is roti, or countless chapatis, with spicy sauce (how hot can you take it?) and vegetables, pulses, or meat, followed by a large dollop of rice to mop it all up. For breakfast there is dosa\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsplarge, thin, crispy (slightly greasy at the edges) curved pancake, dunked in a selection of spicy sauces and unknown concoctions. Some involve coconut, or chickpeas. Most are definitively hot. Curry for brekkie. Quite a wake-up call. This comes with short, very sweet, cups of coffee.I have a cold shower and potter about the area near the hotel. Lots of stray dogs and cows. Everyone stares at me. I stick out like a (sore) thumb. So white I’m china blue, remember, complete with permanent, haggard bags beneath my eyes. Namaste, I bow to every stranger.Five hours after I usually eat, I’m famished, and guzzle whatever there is. How unusual. I have a history of, to put it mildly, being fussy (or severely disordered eating). In India I eat whenever and whatever food is given. We discuss the plans for today.The guru will lead us to villages\u0026nbspwhere we will meet members of the Aasi people\u0026nbspand talk to them about the role that art and craft plays in their daily lives and traditions. We will ask if they would like to make art with us, and take part in creative workshops about storytelling, to hear and share their stories, about their lives, homes, culture and their spiritual beliefs.The first village we go to is laden with sense stimuli. I watch the ritualistic sacrifice of a cock and a boar. They squirm and twitch. Blood flows. Still, they convulse. Where is life? I think. Surely they’re dead? Why are they moving? The spirit doesn’t leave these bodies immediately. It is applauded, hallowed to the Aasis. Engrossing, revolting, captivating: a powerful ceremony.This is set within the deep, earthy chthonia (or the underworld) of the landscape around the village. A meeting is called, dominated by the men. They do all the talking. The women (who do all the work in the fields, and seem to run the economy and sub-structure of the working village) are silent. We decide that we would like to work with the women and the children, so we ask for permission to talk with them about our project. They are silent. The village meeting becomes “one for the lads”, and we make no headway with discussions or plans about the project.There is apparently a school teacher who speaks English. I long to find him, so that I can have some kind of input, or understand the conversation, so far in Hindi. My inability to follow or make any sense whatsoever of the discussion (being left outside of all discussion) continues to be a huge problem.We find the teacher. He invites us into the shady classroom – a cool, airy, open space with mud walls and a roof. Relieved, I open a spiel about the aims and intentions of the project. The teacher interrupts me:“Yes, but what’s in it for us?”“We have you westerners come here often,” he continues. “I understand why you are here. The Aasis are very interesting to the west, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need you. What have you to give us that we don’t already have or want? No one will participate in August. We’re all busy in the fields. It’s impossible, then. Other times are difficult. You haven’t made it clear exactly what benefits you’re offering us, in any case.”The\u0026nbspAasis\u0026nbspare very interesting to the West, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need youThis is pertinent, practical and ontological criticism. It points towards serious flaws in the project, which need addressing. Urgently. What are we offering to or for the Aasis? Why would they need this project? Or is it just about me, my ideas, my project, my hopes? Except, by now the project is far larger than my own investment in it. It’s a global collaboration.The guru says this man is a case of “intellectual arrogance”, and we must continue, despite his claims. But we need to pause and reflect. The man was saying that I am arrogant the colonial coming over to instal her views – which suit my purposes\u0026nbspbut not the Aasis’. I do nothing for the Aasis.Downcast, I leave the village in sheer dismay. It seems the “untouchables”\u0026nbsp(rightly) don’t want to be touched and we have no right to do so.Bumpy journey on the way to the second village. We have lunch. There are eight of us, including our guru’s conglomeration of friends. I’m silent, exhausted, and thoughtful. A thousand and one (hundred) rupees later, I’m running out of money fast. Very bad mood. Off to village two, and I hope it’s more successful. But, doubtful, the whole plan’s in ruins.Eight of us journey, squeezed into the car, to the second village, which is a much more positive experience. When we arrive, we meet lots of children at the school and they seem subdued, reserved, silent, restrained. We later find out that their parents dope them with the local wine (made in each village) until they’re quiet and fall asleep, so the parents aren’t bothered by them.This village is much smaller and more remote. A different culture, a different dialect. We speak with the women, the schoolteacher, the chief. By the end of our visit, the women and children are following us around and invite us to have a drink of water and a private meeting (for and with the women), while\u0026nbspthe men are doing the same thing nearby.Then we are invited for sweet tea and some weird marzipan snack thing at the chief’s big house (outside the village). I am a sheer outsider because of the language barrier. I have no idea what anyone is saying.Fast-forward:\u0026nbspthe trip is now ON. After such a positive meeting with different members of the second village, we are formally invited to stay with them for a few days in August, and to collaborate artistically with the women and children.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumptionAfter the second village we go back to Kondagaon and I have a cold shower to refresh. Exhausted, yet again, always. Shortly, myself and my two colleagues go to the one restaurant in the region we’ve been going to, three times a day, every day. At last we can debrief and discuss what we’ve seen and learned in the villages. Our conversation restores (if momentarily) my hopes in the project. I go to bed full of hot, spicy stimuli, and fall straight to sleep (gratefully).In the morning, I awake promptly. I go for another walk in the streets, to talk to the lurking cows I have by now befriended. Pensive, I consider how the project is challenging all of my resources: ethically, linguistically, financially, corporeally, emotionally. I do not know if I could afford all these differing, demanding expenses.Soon it’s time for dosa, a shot of coffee, and onwards to village number three. We arrive. There is a Gond\u0026nbspreligious festival, which involves the selection of men to embody God. In the distance, I can see a man shaking and screaming, in a trance, as the spirit ascends into his body. His visionary ecstasy is pure, so powerful. He enters a trance, apparently to relieve suffering in the village.All the men are involved in this crucial meeting at the local temple. We watch from afar, and then go back to the village to talk to the women.This village is very spread out – quite a distance between houses. All the women are busy in the fields. Lots of buildings being erected, lots of development, brand new houses with\u0026nbsptelevision aerials. Government funding is marked by logo on each home. This is pure propaganda. They take the old tradition of building houses from mud and natural materials, with natural lighting, and replace it with cheap asbestos and electricity, branded with a political logo.Meanwhile, no one has turned up for our meeting. Eventually they arrive, but they are not interested in the project.Onwards with village four, which has a population of about 1,000. I can’t follow the conversation that evolves during our meeting with these people, due to the language barrier. They understand Hindi (partially)\u0026nbspbut can’t speak it. A long way off, I gain the impression that these people already have a powerful tradition of living artistically. Their main mediums are dancing and singing. They spend most days in the forests gathering flowers for wine, and wood. They are non-committal about whether our project will be useful to them, or not. Will you teach us a craft? They ask. Sure, we reply. Can we then learn a livelihood, to earn money?This is not our intention. The Aasis have no distinction between art and life. Art is intrinsic to and part of their daily living habits, their ontology, their traditions and ancient culture. They don’t really understand the way we determine or distinguish works of art. It’s fascinating to learn about the role art plays for Aasis.It may seem weird to them that we come over and talk about inventing a project to “do” art together, when they may not “do” art as such.\u0026nbspIn any case, they surely\u0026nbspdon’t want any white westerner to come and pollute this pure, beautiful world. I feel out of place, selfish, unneeded.So where is the project? At best, severely challenged. Where am I? Exhausted. Worried.Village five. This seems a very positive space. The people are generous with their innate creativity. As soon as we arrive, one of the women (clutching her baby on one hip) marks our foreheads with red pigment, to celebrate the religious festival “Holi”. I encourage her to put a little in my book, then I spit on the powder and we both shape and seal it onto the paper. Art!We go for a long walk around the village, meeting lots of children. We are invited to return, to fulfil our project and make art with them, in August. Excellent.How a charity uses photography to give Kenyan children a chanceWhat it’s like to walk through Kenya’s Maasai Mara with lionsProtests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWhen is Holi, what is its significance and how is it celebrated?This is a very challenging trip, on many levels. It’s hard work. I love it here. But in India I feel like an outcast, never worthy of value, a sore thumb. Because of the colour of my skin. Because I can’t speak Hindi. Because I’m English. Because I haven’t trained as an art therapist (like my colleagues, who take over). Because I apparently don’t have anything to offer. Which simply isn’t true. If the Aasis are outsiders, I am outside their outside, as the white, mute, colonial invader. This is a distinctly uncomfortable, disorientating\u0026nbspscenario. I sit, like a (large, squatting) lemon, trying to follow what sounds like gibberish, with no success. I get distracted by all the wonderful animals (everywhere) and become besotted by the beautiful children. I gaze around me, taking in the earth, the jungle, the fields, the blue houses. It’s compelling. I can’t follow what’s being said, except for occasional translations so, in a selfish way, I feel left out. A waste of space.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumption. I can’t provide meaning or content (other than monetary) since I can’t speak Hindi. They waffle on and on and on and I just can’t understand a thing. An outsider. Pointless.Heated discussion in the car on the five-hour journey back to Raipur. I raise my dissatisfaction with how things are going, and tried to simplify matters: either this happens in August, when I can come (as planned), or you two take the project away and do it another time, when I cannot come. Then it’s your project and I play no part. We argue. My colleagues have very grave concerns about the direction the project is leading, which in their eyes, is unethical. It is fundamentally wrong to go in August, and impose ourselves on the Aasis at their busiest time, harvest. I say that we asked the Aasis about this, and whereas most villages said we must not come in August, two villages said that they would welcome us. The guru adds that there would always be a time available for an activity such as art-making – for example, between 5pm-9pm\u0026nbsp– even during harvest.My colleagues say that it is still intrinsically unethical to impose ourselves upon them. In addition, it’s wrong and scientifically unclinical to live with the Aasis during the project. “They eat cats!”I want to inhabit the project, and stay with the people, eat, sleep, make art, work with the people. This is crucial. Our guru concurs, you can’t do this without living with them, he says. It will only work if you stay with the Aasis.Krishna and Jaya are very unhappy with this idea, from a clinical perspective, which relies on having critical distance between oneself and one’s client.All my suggestions and all the project are unethical and complicated.F***\u0026nbspthat. It’s a simple decision: either it happens. And it happens in August, if it happens with me. Or it either doesn’t happen at all, or they take it away and do something very different.Jaya says that if there has to be a decision now, she and Krishna (with art therapy hats) will have to pull out. I retort: fine. I’ll do it with our guru. It’s on!My proposal: I will come out for two weeks in August and deliver the project, showing and sharing art with the intention of retaining social history. We want to open and share ancient cultures, storytelling, narratives, crystallised, composed, distributed, retained, made history. I will stay in the villages and our guru will collaborate and contribute as translator. Krishna and Jaya may decide to join me if they eventually deem what’s happening sufficiently “ethical”, whatever that means.In Raipur. A horrible situation last night. After a very difficult, tense journey here from Kondagaon, after the disintegration of the project, there is a heavy silence. We stop for fuel. I have to pay. My card won’t work. Blocked again. I have no idea how I’m going to pay for everything during the rest of this trip.We arrive at the hotel our guru had booked. Krishna and Jaya decide to share a room so they can discuss the project, and their reservations, without me. I have a room to myself. I get very excited because there is a kettle and a teacoffee-making facility. I accidentally turn on the kettle and it catches fire! Suddenly there is a fire in the room! F***! I hastily pick up the burning kettle, with flames everywhere, and I chuck it in the sink. Sheesh. Fire!\u0026nbspI turn on the tap and luckily it soon goes out. Smoke everywhere! Choke! Even worse than the polluted smog outside. I go downstairs and ask for another room. Drama.At 8pm two people whom I met and worked with on my last trip here, in Raigarh, turn up. These are genuine and committed political activists, well known for their dedicated work on human rights and the Aasi people. They showed me round villages during my previous visit to Korba, when I made a documentary film. I remember going to a Neo-Marxist (Naxalite) meeting with them. Though I had no idea what was being said, I sensed the fervour and passion, always uprising in their voices, in their lives, in their need. Something must be done! This had been one reason why I’d returned to India, to make art with the Aasis. But this time I’m in a different area, with different tribes, who have different problems. No mines here.The couple made a five-hour train journey to see me in Raipur. Wow! How nice, I think to myself. We can have dinner and chat. But they don’t speak English and expect me to put them up for the night here at this hotel. The white colonialist should pay for everything. They also think I have a serious political proposition and want to collaborate with their staunchly activist agenda.\u0026nbspInnocent, rather confused, I did not realise they were coming at all, let alone under these conditions.We go out for dinner to clear the air. More roti at a nearby restaurant. The couple ask pertinent questions for the project as a whole. They are coming from the perspective of the Aasis’ around Raigarh, who face the annihilation of their landscape, homes and livelihoods by mining. They say to us: we need political solutions, we need our homeland restored, we need jobs not art! What can art actually do\u0026nbspin times of severe turmoil and trouble? In practical terms, an artwork won’t save someone’s life, it won’t bring social, political or economic solutions.By now my project is in tatters. I can’t begin to retaliate to these crucial challenges. The couple say that my project, or any project with art, or art per se, cannot help the Aasi population anywhere in India. There are other, pressing, urgent demands that should take precedence over anything that wants to engage with art, craft, culture or cultural heritage. Art is a luxury, not a basic need.These ideas and criticisms are essential to face and focus on. I retreat and rethink everything. The couple return to Raigarh and I spend one last night in Raipur. In the morning, I go to the airport and they have found my luggage! It went from Bombay to Delhi back to Bombay, then to Raipur. Anyway, I have it now. Jam-packed full of creased clothes and melted cheese (my present for the Aasis, now a pile of smudged fat and grease, leaking through the molten rubber casing). The situation between us three “collaborators”\u0026nbspis very difficult. I’m the Rich Old Stupid Mute(d) Colonial Imposter. Good enough to pay. Nothing else. Silence. Then, at the airport, we separate (even on the same flight).The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumbNow on my own, I have time to reflect. This trip went from awful – luggage lost, fraud, card blocked – to worse than extreme,\u0026nbspbecoming the Outsider, a crisis of identity.Back in Bombay, I go for a frank meeting with the people who had offered to fund the whole project (that is, invest and pay for the major undertaking proposed in August, and also for the global travelling exhibition, book, and other intended happenings). As a result of this meeting, the project is officially OFF. For a practical reason, the funders said it would be madness to try and do it during the monsoon season, and simply would not be possible.Off for another reason: there are already numerous NGOs that work with the Aasis and their art. The funders suggest that if I still want to do this project, I must collaborate and work under one of them. There’s apparently an awful lot of AasiGond art out at the moment, so nothing new or valuable about my proposition. It already exists. It’s very popular. This points to yet another flaw:\u0026nbspinadequate research. It seems that there is no need for my project, and it must not happen at the only time I can do it. Shall I wait, rethink, gain new collaborators, work under another organisation (not from my own ideas), and then in two years’ time, after I’ve qualified as an art therapist, try again? But I’ll have a career – I hope – by then? The passion will have withered. It’s inconceivable. So it’s off. Officially.I’m distraught. I have spent the past four years organising this project. And now, it’s been a waste of time, energy, money. So much money.I leave the meeting with the funders with a premise from contemporary Indian neurology. A neuroscientist friend of the couple is at the meeting. We talk for a while, and I tell her about the damage to my left temporal lobe, which still affects me. Do you have any ideas for how to retain memory? I ask her. Yes, she says. In my research, I have found a solution to brain damage: to regenerate brain cell growth you must starve yourself, and take up running. I suggest you eat a low-calorie diet and go for a run at least twice daily. That should restore your memory and make your brain work better. Touché. I do not tell her that my previous experience of extreme starvation had been almost deadly. Is this advice what I should take from my time in India?By now, I’m in my hotel room in Bombay. Last night I slept well, because of my medication. I awoke at around 4:45am\u0026nbspand had a coffee. I will have something to eat at 7.30am – free breakfast, included in the expensive package of staying here. I was very upset yesterday. I’m still upset now, due to the collapse of the project. I don’t feel very well, mentally or physically. I’m exhausted, distraught, I feel dizzy, my head aches, I’m so disappointed.I mean, nothing’s wrong: by now I have my luggage, I’m in a room at a hotel. There’s hot water, wifi and a kettle. My bank card is now working, and I have enough cash left to get me to the airport. But I am defeated. My spirit, my passion for this project, for the Aasis, has died. How pathetic. A waste. Hopeless. Now. In fact.Created with Sketch.The blind elephants of India\u0027s popular Amber Fort tourist attraction Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amber Fort is one of India’s biggest tourist attractions, where elephants, many of whom are blind and lame, are forced to haul tourists up and down the steep fortMore than 100 elephants are kept at Amber FortOf the 103 elephants, 10 had tuberculosis, 19 were blind in one eye or both, and all suffered foot problems, according to a 2018 health report by the Animal Welfare Board of India When the animals are not forced to give rides to tourists they are often kept alone at night, heavily chained in “concrete boxes”.

Many visitors do not realise the animals are blind or lame.Tourist elephant rides are a steady business at Amber FortWhen I came to India, I was relieved and thrilled to be going to a warmer climate, to be releasing my darling project, to be collaborating with friends and useful people, to be fulfilling hopes and dreams. I was seriously considering emigrating to live in India. I changed my mind, when so disheartened – completely losing heart – by reactions and assumptions to me as a person and my project. For the Aasis, the guru, his friends, my collaborators, everyone I encountered in India, I am – and can only be – the colonial invader. I hold history on my back. It cripples me.The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumb. This happened because I can’t speak either Hindi or any of the Aasi dialects, I had to rely on my colleagues’ translation, I was separated and removed from proceedings and decisions. I felt separated and judged as the only white person.Crushed, I felt an outcast. This was very interesting, since perhaps I could then empathise with the Aasis’ situation on the margins of Indian society, and the caste system. I was an outsider, the Aasis are outsiders, but I was unable to connect with them. I felt cast out of their being cast out.The Aasis are not interested in my art project. They say they are happy, self-contained, self-sufficient people, they don’t need a western intervention from a white person.Protests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWorld only thinks of Kashmir when it’s close to war, say politiciansThe girls hoping to fire India to Street Child Cricket World Cup gloryIndia bans imports of waste plastic to tackle environmental crisisIndia close to creating ‘green fireworks’ in effort to curb pollutionHaving been planning this project for over four years now, this is extremely disappointing. What can I learn from it? Perhaps the idea that there is never such a thing as “post”-colonial is an important observation to take from this episode. On the one hand, my proposed intervention seemed to rely on dominance and hierarchy (despite my best intentions). I approached the Aasi people with ideas and propositions about engaging with art as a form of sense-making. Some of these ideas were based around a form of art psychotherapy (with my colleagues, who were trained, and arguably blinkered around this field).Maybe this seemed an imposition of unwanted material. Who says the Aasis want or need art therapy? In the area we visited, there seemed little social unrest or disturbance. Any intervention from a westerner seemed unnecessary, unwanted. That is not to say the Aasis did not welcome usme. They listened, and two villages invited us to come into their community and make art with them, to do our project. But it is important to learn that the project being offered to the Aasis seemed to reconfirm a colonial dynamic. The contrary was my intention.I am left wondering if or how it is ever possible to be truly “post”-colonial. Are the remnants of history, the battle scars of the British Empire, impossible to eradicate or move on from? Now, I must consider how to facilitate a project which has a more elastic, symbiotic rapport with people on the margins, without reconfirming the barrier between the inside and outside of those margins.I had hoped my project would engage the Aasis’ ancient heritage and culture, to celebrate their innate capacity to regenerate. I began as the utopian wishing to destroy the empirical patriarchy I emerge feeling ever restrained, and crushed, by that very history and identity I’d wanted to challenge and disrupt.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The mysterious, so-called \u0027Lausanne\u0027 Sunflowers – the first Arles Sunflowers painting – with turquoise background. It was created in the summer of 1886 at Van Gogh\u0027s studio at Arles, north of Marseille in Provence. It has not been show to the public since 1948. 1889, oil on canvas. This painting depicts the view from the window of Van Gogh\u0027s asylum room of Saint-Remy-de-Provence. It is one of the most recognised paintings in the history of Western culture.1889, oil on canvas. The most recognised of several iris paintings made by Van Gogh at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum, in the last year before his death in 1890. 1889, oil on canvas. Van Gogh painted over 43 self-portraits, paintings and drawings over a period of 10 years. He wrote to his sister: \u0027I am looking for a deeper likeness than that obtained by a photographer\u0027 and to his brother: \u0027People say, and I am willing to believe it, that it is hard to know yourself. But it is not easy to paint yourself either. The portraits painted by Rembrandt are more like a revelation.\u0027Oil on canvas, 1890. This painting was completed in early May, when Van Gogh was suffering a severe relapse of poor health – two months before his death. It is based on a pencil drawing, \u0027Worn Out\u0027, from a series of studies he made of a war veteran in 1882.620 Cafe Terrace at NightOil on canvas, 1888. This work was the first in a trilogy of paintings that featured starlit skies, completed over two years. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the painting and wrote to his sister: \u0027Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot... I find satisfaction in painting things immediately.\u00271888, oil on canvas. The five customers in the scene have described as \u0027three drunks and derelicts in a large public room... huddled down in sleep or stupor.\u0027 Van Gogh told his brother that the cafe owner, Ginoux, had taken so much money it was time to take his revenge by painting the place.820 Bedroom in ArlesOil on canvas, 1888. Three authentic versions of this painting were made, easily discernible from the different paintings on the right wall. Oil on canvas, 1888. This painting is currently at the National Gallery in London. It was completed after Van Gogh moved from the Hotel Carrel to the Cafe de la Gare at Arles, south France. 1885, oil on canvas. Van Gogh chose this deliberately tricky composition to prove himself as a figure painter, wanting to show the way \u0027they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish... that they have thus honestly earned their food\u0027. 1120 Road with Cypress and Star1890, oil on canvas. Also known as Country Road, this was the last painting Van Gogh made in Saint Remy, It is part of the large Van Gogh collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo in the Netherlands.1220 Starry Night Over the Rhone1888, oil on canvas. Another of Van Gogh\u0027s paintings of Arles at nighttime – painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhone a few minutes walk from the Yellow House, which he was renting at the time. 1888, oil on canvas. In a short space of time during his first weeks at Arles, Van Gogh painted some fifteen orchards, hoping they would sell well because his subject, the glorious blossoms of the flowering trees, had the power to \u0027cheer everyone up\u0027. 1420 Self Portrait with a Grey Felt Hat1887, oil on canvas. This self portrait is slightly unusual because Van Gogh\u0027s face is angled to face straight towards the observer. Most of them depicted the face as it appeared in the mirror he used, so the right side seen in the image was actually the left side of his face. 1888 - 1890, oil on canvas. Van Gogh loved flowering trees, which to him symbolised hope and new life. This painting was created to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, the son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.This was part of Van Gogh\u0027s preparation for The Potato Eaters, where he attempted to paint a figure against the light. He struggled, telling his brother Theo: \u0027It\u0027s a difficult effect\u0027, yet he succeeded in a strong contrast with the almost-black head of the woman and the use of white for the window, which focuses the gaze mainly on the woman\u0027s hands. 1720 Peasant Woman Against a Background of WheatOil on canvas, 1890. This painting, one of several versions by Van Gogh, has exchanged hands several times and was bought by Stephen Wynn in 1997 for $47.5 million. Seven years later, it was sold to American investor Steven A Cohen for more than $100 million. Oil on canvas, 1889. In the cypress trees of Saint Remy, Van Gogh found beauty as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. He was enraptured but also challenged: \u0027It\u0027s the dark patch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it\u0027s one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine\u0027. 1888, oil on canvas. Art historians believe this is the only Van Gogh painting he managed to sell during his lifetime, and has been listed among his major works. It was sold in Brussels for 400 francs (about £3,000) to Anna Boch, an impressionist painter and art collector from Belgium, who was the sister of Van Gogh\u0027s friend Eugene Boch. 2020 Wheatfield with Crows1890, oil on canvas.Commonly regarded as Van Gogh\u0027s final painting (with some doubt from art historians due to lack of historical records). Around 10 July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo and wife Jo Bonger to say he had painted another three large canvases since visiting them in Paris the week before. Two of them, he said, expressed sadness and what he called \u0027extreme loneliness\u0027, but he also believed them to show the healthy and fortifying nature of the countryside. 1886, oil on canvas.

However, a volunteer told The Huffington Post that the work wasn’t created to be immediately destroyed by the public, and it has faced some criticism from the public.\u0026nbspJournalist\u0026nbspKevin Lheritier\u0026nbspcalled the work an “ecological disaster” on Twitter. He added: “On the screens, the result is beautiful but on the ground: a catastrophe, papers flying around. The visitors respect nothing.”JR, whose real name is Jean Rene, also tweeted that he was dedicating the work to his\u0026nbspfriend and collaborator Agnès Varda, who he worked with on the 2017 documentary Faces Places.\u0026nbsp“I finished this one for you Agnès Varda, you loved people, pasting and illusion ... I am sure you can see it. I did something that can be seen from the sky.

But debate has raged about whether the detection was legitimate, as well as about where it could have come from if it is.Now it has been independently confirmed for the first time, marking a major step forward in the hunt for the mysterious source of the gas.On Earth, methane is a key sign of life, and is emitted from biological organisms. Even if the Martian gas is coming from another process, it is still likely to be an indication that the red planet\u0027s surface is far more active than previously thought.In June 2013, the Curiosity rover spotted methane on the Martian surface, near the Gale Crater.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nasa celebrated Black Friday by looking into space instead — sharing pictures of black holes230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

That should prove useful to scientists looking to investigate further where the methane could be coming from.Ever since methane was first detected, more than 10 years ago, debate has raged about whether it is coming from microorganisms or from geochemical reactions underground.If it is coming from microorganisms then scientists could be able to follow the trace of gas in an attempt to discover whatever life could be hiding beneath the Martian surface. But the researchers in the new paper, titled \u0027Independent confirmation of a methane spike on Mars and a source region east of Gale Crater\u0027 and published in Nature Geoscience, note that will not be possible until its source can be found.Scientists sent the ExoMars orbiter to the planet in 2016, in the hope that it can better understand the operation of methane on its surface and possible understand better where it is emerging from.As well as confirming the previous detection, and helping locate a possible location to search for further emissions, the new paper suggests that the methane on Mars might not be emerging in the way some expect. Rather than coming from large emissions and being present around the whole of Mars, it might instead come out in small, short emissions from whatever process is producing it, the researchers write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others, who come from the most severely deprived families, simply do not eat during the day, the research found.It comes\u0026nbspafter government figures last week revealed that the number of children living in absolute poverty across the UK – a figure that had been gradually falling since 2012 – had increased by 200,000 in a year to a total of 3.7 million.The new research, published in a new book called Living Hand to Mouth? Children and food in low-income families, written by UCL’s Institute of Education, tells the stories of 51 UK children from low-income households and their experiences of food at home, at school and in social settings.It reveals how some schools restrict the food options they can select, causing embarrassment for children.The government’s defence has gone – it is time to act on child povertyGovernment condemned over ‘shocking’ rise in child povertyThe government must act on child poverty warnings“And it’s like you’re really restricted to what you can eat with free school meals ...\u0026nbspSo now I just get what I know I’m safe with, so a small baguette and carton of juice.”The findings also reveal how children whose families have no recourse to public funds\u0026nbsp– usually because of unresolved immigration status –\u0026nbspare not entitled to free school meals, and that while some schools fund lunches for these children, others do not, meaning some youngsters go hungry during the day.Emmanuel, 14, from inner London, said: “Sometimes you don’t have enough energy, you cannot cope in the classroom so you have to like try and rest a bit. You just put your head on the table and you end up falling asleep in the classroom and you get in trouble for it.”Just over half (26 of 48) of the children who completed the question in the self-completion questionnaire reported eating vegetables at least five or six times a week, and just over a third (17 of 47) reported eating fruit at least five or six times a week.Separate\u0026nbspresearch carried out for Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG)\u0026nbsplast week\u0026nbspfound that the four-year freeze on children’s benefits alone would lead to average loses of £240 per year for families with children.Number of UK children in absolute poverty hits 3.7m after huge riseAlison Garnham, chief executive of CPAG,\u0026nbspwhich published the book,\u0026nbspsaid: “The young people in this study make the case for universal free school meals more powerfully than anyone else could.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Their hunger, their shame, their sense of being cut off from learning and social opportunities – all because parents can’t afford enough food – are appalling in a society that believes every child matters.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“Universal free school meals should be part of the solution but wider government action is needed – urgently – to eradicate the poverty that underlies children’s hunger. As a minimum, free school meals should be restored for all families on universal credit.”Thirty per cent of children are living in relative poverty in the UK, with the number having risen by 500,000 in six years, from 3.6 million in 2010-2012, to 4.1 million in 2016-17.\u0026nbspMs Garnham said the priority should be to “rebalance family budgets” by lifting the freeze on working and non-working benefits – which has been in place since 2015 – so that they rise again with inflation.Co-author of the research, Rebecca O’Connell, warned that ahead of Brexit, the implementation of further cuts to welfare benefits and rising inflation – and the plight of families who are struggling to feed themselves –\u0026nbspwas “unlikely to improve”, and urged that “radical change” was needed.“In the face of piecemeal responses and government neglect, the outlook is set to remain bleak,” she said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Fire fighters attend to two police cars that were destroyed after being set on fire outside Goldthorpe police station in South Yorkshire in a suspected arson attackForensics teams work at the scene of a stabbing in Edmonton in London.

A plan for a final say referendum was rejected by another narrow 12 vote margin.But if the UK does not pass any Brexit option by 12 April it would need to revoke Article 50 or get approval from an extension for the EU to avoid crashing out with a no-deal.EU will delay Brexit to allow another referendum“If the UK Parliament does not vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement in the coming days only two options would remain,” Mr Barnier told an audience at a think-tank.“Leaving without an agreement or requesting a longer extension of the Article 50 period.”Some Brexiteer Tory MPs actively want a no-deal Brexit, despite the near certainty of serious economic damage to the UK. A maximum of 37 backed any of the soft Brexit options in the Commons last night, with hundreds voting against them. Last week 157 Tory MPs\u0026nbspexplicitly voted for a\u0026nbspno-deal motion.But Mr Barnier\u0026nbsppoured cold water on Brexiteer assumptions about a no-deal and said the EU would require the UK to ratify Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement before it would begin trade negotiations with a Britain that had crashed out.We have always said that we can accept a customs union, or relationship along the style of the Norway model.He said he was sure that in the event of a no-deal “a few months after I’m sure UK will ask EU to begin negotiations” on trade but that “in that case the withdrawal agreement we put on the table at the beginning of this negotiation will be still here”. The negotiator said the UK would still have to settle the issues of citizens rights, Ireland, and the orce bill included in the controversial treaty.On Sunday The Independent reported that EU officials were behind the scenes saying that\u0026nbspanother extension would only be possible with a general election, second referendum, or compromise political process to find a majority for Theresa May’s deal. Mr Barnier confirmed the story on Tuesday morning.He added: “The UK may ask for another extension. Such an extension would carry significant risks for the EU. Therefore a strong justification would be needed.”Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of Parliament“During any long extension there will be no renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, no, never,” Mr Barnier confirmed.On whether the EU would accept the various soft Brexit options being considered by the Commons, he said: “We have always said that we can accept a customs union, or relationship along the style of the Norway model.“In fact, however, the Political Declaration today can accommodate all of these options already. It leaves the door open for a variety of outcomes. But if the UK so wishes we are ready to rework the Political Declaration.”In a statement issued after\u0026nbspHouse of Commons votes last night European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt warned that a hard Brexit was becoming “nearly inevitable”. He added: “On Wednesday, the UK\u0026nbsphas a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.”EU leaders will gather for a summit in Brussels on 10 April next Wednesday, 48 hours before the UK is due to crash out of the EU. They will decide a way forward – including whether to grant the UK a long extension, if one is requested.We’ll tell you what’s true.

how strongly I feel about the union.”Mr Dodds warned his party could not support the prime minister’s deal because the isive backstop – designed to prevent a hard border on the island of\u0026nbspIreland\u0026nbsp– could see Northern Ireland being left behind.He added: “We want to see Brexit delivered, we believe the referendum result should be respected and delivered on, but it can’t be at the risk of separating Northern Ireland out from the rest of the United Kingdom.”The DUP, whose 10 MPs\u0026nbspprop up Ms May’s minority government, joined a hard core of Tory Brexiteers

It\u0027s more important than the Tory party.Asked about standing for the Tory leadership, Mr Davis said: People have been coming to me for months on this... and I say I\u0027m not going to think about it.Why? Because this issue is more important than the leadership.Mr Davis added that the next leader would need to be strongly pro-Leave, stating: I think it probably has to be a Brexiteer, but that doesn\u0027t mean it has to be a right winger.Former Conservative leader William Hague\u0026nbsphas warned that an early election could leave the Tories in a far worse condition than after Tony Blair\u0027s landslide victory in 1997 - where the party was left with only 165 MPs.Writing in the Daily , the Tory peer said: The internal situation in the Conservative Party is much worse than it was in 1997.The ruin I moved in to as the new leader was, at least, intact.We had many differences, but we resolved them without talk of leaving altogether, opposing our own party on a vote of confidence, or deselecting tranches of MPs. We all joined together in the long task of rebuilding.By contrast, some of today\u0027s leadership candidates may find themselves sitting in a small ruin on their own.MPs have begun a fresh push to agree an alternative\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspplan that would be put to a\u0026nbspreferendum\u0026nbspin the autumn, despite\u0026nbspthrowing out all options last night.Talks will begin to settle on a “composite motion”, combining soft Brexit proposals with a commitment to putting them to the people to confirm – with the alternative of staying in the EU.Anna Soubry, who defected to\u0026nbspThe Independent Group\u0026nbspfrom the Conservatives, insisted a compromise was still achievable and that supporters of a\u0026nbspFinal Say\u0026nbspreferendum were making “huge progress”.Read the full piece here.The UK would have to hold a referendum, general election, or some kind of other “political process” if it wants to delay\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspagain, the EU’s chief negotiator has said.Speaking in Brussels the morning after MPs yet again rejected a slate of compromise Brexit options\u0026nbspMichel Barnier\u0026nbspsaid a no-deal “becomes day after day more likely”.Mr Barnier confirmed that the EU would accommodate any move by MPs to try and soften\u0026nbspBrexit, stating that deals like the so-called “Norway option” or a customs union had always been on the table.\u0026nbspRead our breaking story here.James Brokenshire, Chris Grayling, Penny Mordaunt and Sajid Javid have arrived\u0026nbspat Downing Street for political cabinet.In a sign of how febrile things are, Conservative MP Nick Boles resigned from his party\u0027s\u0026nbspwhip on the\u0026nbspCommons last night, seconds after MPs\u0026nbsprejected\u0026nbspalternatives to Theresa May\u0027s deal.\u0026nbspMy party refuses to compromise, he said.\u0026nbspI regret therefore that I can no longer sit for this party.He later tweeted that he would sit as an Independent Progressive Conservative.Read our piece here.After last night\u0027s marathon votes, what\u0027s going on today?Theresa May has scheduled a five-hour Cabinet meeting instead of the usual 90 minutes. Starting from 9am, the first three hours will be political cabinet, which is held in the absence of civil servants.Such a long session has sent hares running, with Westminster already abuzz with rumours over the prospect of a snap election. It could also be a chance to discuss the PM\u0027s departure, after she told MPs she would quit before the next phase of the Brexit talks.Then there is due to be an ordinary cabinet from 1-3pm, with civil servants present again.MPs have failed again to agree on an alternative\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspplan, increasing the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal next week.\u0026nbspIn a second series of “indicative votes”, two options were only narrowly rejected: to keep the UK in the EU\u0026nbspcustoms union\u0026nbsp– or in both the\u0026nbspsingle market\u0026nbspand a customs arrangement.The Commons also turned down putting any agreed deal to a\u0026nbspFinal Say referendum – and rejected revoking\u0026nbspArticle 50\u0026nbspif the UK is close to the no-deal Brexit cliff-edge.Read our overnight piece here.Ahead of today\u0027s cabinet meetings, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has reminded politicians the deal presented by Theresa May is the only one currently on the table.\u0026nbspIf the UK “still wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner this agreement is and will be the only one”, he said.Speaking in Brussels, he said: If the UK parliament does not vote in favour of the withdrawal agreement in the coming days only two options would remain.Leaving without an agreement or requesting a longer extension of the Article 50 period.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s Brexit live blog.After MPs rejected the four alternatives to Theresa May\u0027s deal in indicative votes in the Commons yesterday,\u0026nbspthe prime minister is to hold lengthy cabinet meetings in a bid to find a solution.Things are due to kick off with a five-hour cabinet meeting starting at 9am.Despite Ms May’s departure plan having been rejected by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspthree times in the House of Commons, it is believed she may try to put it to the house for a fourth time.The meetings come amid growing speculation the prime minister could call a snap general election if a fourth attempt to pass her deal fails.We’ll tell you what’s true.

That’s what we’ll be working on this morning,” she said.Ms Soubry pointed out that the number of Tories backing a referendum was rising – from 7 to 15 on Monday night – and that, with 280 votes, a confirmatory ballot was the most popular option.“We made more progress in a days’ worth of debate than in two years of this government,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Created with Sketch.Put It To The People march: Best of The Independent’s pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And she urged Theresa May to take the escape route from the Brexit crisis being offered, even by putting her own much-defeated deal back to the public.“If she wanted to, she could bring it back with a confirmatory vote. She would win a majority and this entire Brexit nightmare would be over by the autumn,” Ms Soubry added.On Monday night, MPs rejected all four possible Brexit alternatives, which were:* A “permanent and comprehensive” customs union – defeated by 276-273 votes* “Common market 2.0”, to keep the UK in the single market and a “customs arrangement – defeated by 282-261.* A confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal – defeated by 292-280.* Revoking of Article 50 if a crash-out Brexit looms and a no-deal has been rejected – defeated by 292-191.But Ms Soubry said the first two options failed only because their supporters would not agree to them being put to a public vote, which was the obvious area for a successful compromise.Brexit can be delayed if UK calls referendum or general electionEU negotiator warns no-deal \u0027getting more likely by day\u0027I’m a student who campaigned for Brexit – this is why I got it wrongPoliticians are obsessing over Brexit while our planet burnsPerhaps crucially, Nick Boles, the instigator of “Common market 2.0”, dramatically quit the Tory whip moments after its defeat, with a furious blast at his party’s refusal to compromise.Mr Boles also voted for the referendum option, along with one minister – Margot James – and three other former ministers, Steve Brine, Mark Garnier and Ed Vaizey.MPs will take control of the Commons agenda again on Wednesday, perhaps to pass the compromise motion, or even to try to force the prime minister to seek a long Article 50 extension.Ms May is holding a marathon Cabinet session to try and break the Brexit deadlock, as EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a no-deal withdrawal was becoming more likely by the day.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Tom Watson, the deputy leader, agreeing\u0026nbsp“if needs must, we have to then do what’s right”, when asked at the weekend about the warring parties agreeing a truce.So, what is the history of governments of national unity in this country and is the Brexit fiasco driving us towards another one?Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThe key point is that they are rare, because – as you may have noticed since the Leave vote – the parties prefer shouting across the Commons\u0026nbspto cooperating across it.The last national government was led by Winston Churchill during the Second World War, following similar coalitions during the First World War and during the Great Depression of the 1930s.The obvious similarity is that all were times of huge crisis – but, just as significantly, there was an acceptance in all the parties that only cross-party working could provide a solution. Fast-forward to 2019 and there is no such recognition.We’re heading for a long Brexit delay – even the ERG is resigned to itBrexit causes record rise in stockpiling as businesses prepare for worMPs to debate revoking Article 50 before critical Commons Brexit votesBrexit batters businesses and the economy as cliff edge looms The prime minister would rather chew off her own arm than take up solutions from Labour or other parties, despite seeing her deal repeatedly rejected by huge numbers.Similarly, Jeremy Corbyn wants to use the crisis to trigger a general election that would put him in No 10 on a mission to end austerity, showing by and large a remarkable lack of interest in the details of Brexit.Meanwhile, the Commons is holding “indicative votes“\u0026nbspto try to find a common purpose, but has been unable to narrow down the options because MPs cannot agree on how to combine their favoured ones.The lesson is that it requires a consensus to form a government of national unity – and in the absence of such\u0026nbspa consensus, the idea is a non-starter.Which is why there will be not be one to solve Brexit.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

again – as MPs\u0026nbspthrow out all rivals to Theresa May\u0027s defeated Brexit agreementClick to followIndy PoliticsMPs have failed again to agree on an alternative Brexit plan, increasing the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal next week.\u0026nbspIn a second series of “indicative votes”, two options were only narrowly rejected: to keep the UK in the EU customs union – or in both the single market and a customs arrangement.The Commons also turned down putting any agreed deal to a Final Say referendum – and rejected revoking Article 50 if the UK is close to the no-deal Brexit cliff-edge.The results were followed by Nick Boles, the Conservative MP behind the “Common market 2.0” plan for the single market and customs arrangement, dramatically quitting the Tory whip on the Commons floor.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said the cabinet would discuss the impasse tomorrow – but pointed out the UK was due to leave the EU in just 11 days’ time, with no deal in sight.May calls cabinet talks as UK heads towards election \u0027nobody wants\u0027However, Final Say supporters were cheered that their option won more votes than a week ago, securing 280 and losing by just 12 – the narrowest defeat.Peter Kyle, one of the Labour sponsors of the motion, urged colleagues to “see how minorities can be brought together” to still achieve a Commons consensus.Created

them – because their movers refused to agree these paths should then be put to a public voteThere was applause for Mr Boles when he made his shock resignation, telling MPs: “I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret, therefore, to announce that I can no longer sit for this party.”MPs voted on the four options, whittled down from the eight potential alternatives to the prime minister’s thrice-defeated plan, none of which secured a majority a week ago.Nude protesters storm Commons public gallery as MPs debate Brexit2,000 people complain about Jon Snow \u0027white people\u0027 remark on C4 NewsIs this really the most ill-disciplined cabinet in British history?Will the Brexit crisis push us towards a government of national unity?Tory MP says he could vote against government in no confidence motion* A “permanent and comprehensive” customs union, put forward by Ken Clarke, the former Conservative chancellor with Labour support – defeated by 276-273 votes.* “Common market 2.0”, a cross-party bid to keep the UK in the single market and a “customs arrangement”, with support from both Labour and the Scottish Nationalists – defeated by 282-261.* A confirmatory public vote, requiring a Final Say referendum on any Brexit deal before its ratification – defeated by 292-280.* Parliamentary supremacy, put forward by the SNP’s Joanna Cherry and calling for Article 50 to be revoked if a crash-out Brexit looms and a no-deal has been rejected – defeated by 292-191.Conservative MPs were given a free vote on all the options, although cabinet ministers had again been told to abstain.In a letter to Labour MPs, Jeremy Corbyn acknowledged “vastly different and passionately held views”, but had urged support for common market 2.0 “to break the deadlock”.He stressed that Labour was still pushing its plan for alignment with the single market and would “keep all options on the table, including campaigning for a public vote”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Government took a conscious decision and the Chancellor was very explicit that he was not prepared to spend money in making those preparations.That was a disastrous decision. I think,we had done that, then the position today would look very dferent.My preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy — to leave without a deal but to take six months or so to complete the preparations.Then we would be in a much stronger position.If we were to leave without making adequate preparations there would be some short-run dislocation cost. It is hard to know how serious that would be but I think the view that somehow we will have queues of lorries on the M for five years or more is absurd.The important thing is, that, with adequate preparations, I do not believe the long-term economic costs of leaving would be very dferent from staying in the European Union.But the issue should not be just about economics.One of the sad things about this whole debate is that the country has become deeply ided.People on both sides are passionate about it but they are not passionate because they have views about the economic effects.I have not met anyone who said, “I’d be in favour of BrexitI thought the impact on GDP will be less than two per cent but I’ll be in favour of RemainI thought it would be more than five per cent”.It is the issues of identity and culture and politics that are motivating people, which is why I think MPs have somehow lost the plot.When people say the consequence of leaving without a deal is national suicide, I despair.

Is that really less damaging than a clean break, as we’re so often told Inside the single market, our laws stay under European Court of Justice jurisdiction.We still make big annual payments to Brussels and retain “freedom of movement rules. Calling that “Brexit” makes a mockery of the  referendum result.The economic benefits of the single market are, anyway, wildly overstated. All UK firms, including the  per cent that don’t export to the EU, must comply with the expensive EU rules.The single market in services barely exists — severely penalizing the UK, the world’s second-largest services exporter.We don’t need to be in the single market to trade with Europe. The US conducts hundreds of billions of dollars of EU trade every year. We can do the same.If the single market is so great, why is the UK’s trade with the EU shrinking and our non-EU trade expanding  Why do we trade more with the rest of the world The EU’s customs union is also wrongly presented as economic heaven. But it means the UK charges tarfs on imports from outside the EU. So British shoppers pay more for a range of imports, including food and clothing, to shield uncompetitive producers in other EU states.Some  per cent of these tarfs are then sent to Brussels — billions of pounds each year.The customs union also stops Britain striking trade deals with nations outside the EU — four-fths of the global economy.As the centre of economy gravity shts decisively east, it is vital that Britain engages more with the world’s fastest-growing and most populous markets.Nations acting alone have secured far more important trade deals, covering a much bigger share of the global economy. In , Switzerland struck a trade deal with China — so can we.The narrative that Soft Brexit — or no Brexit at all — makes economic sense has been shaped by the same establishment voices who told us, back in , that simply voting to leave the EU would spark “an immediate and profound economic shock”. They were wrong then and wrong now.A Clean Brexit, in contrast, outside the EU’s main legal constructs means Britain would thrive — precisely why Brussels doesn’t want it to happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are currently almost , empty nurse jobs in England.And a new report by think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation and The King’s Fund predicts this could rise to , within five years.In the meantime, it is unsurprising to hear that nine out of ten NHS nurses say staff shortages are affecting the quality of care they can give their patients.One major problem is that we take our nurses for granted. Many AE nurses in particular are subject to unacceptable levels of rudeness, abuse and even violence.Hospitals are increasingly being run by non-medical staff who are mostly driven by targets and not quality of care. And more nurses are having to sit filling out paperwork rather than actually nursing.We also don’t pay nurses enough. You can probably work in Tesco stacking shelves for the same money as some nurses are paid — and live a much less stressful le.All too often, it’s not until we find ourselves dependent on nurses doing a good job that we truly appreciate them and what they do for us.When my grandmother was very ill in hospital, pretty much the only good thing about her hospital experience was the nurses.They were kind, chatty, cared for her, spoke to her and treated her with dignity in a very grim situation.We need to start appreciating nurses before it’s too late. Then we need to put our money where our mouths are.Sure, nursing is a vocational job. But money still matters, especiallyyou are living in a big city.It costs £, a year to train as a nurse. Nurses who have served ten years with the NHS should be given that money back in what I would call a “legacy payment”.If that payment is given in their pension, it would cost the Government very little, but I am sure nurses would love it.Since , the Government has axed the bursaries for people who are studying nursing or midwery at university.The budget for helping staff to develop their skills in the workplace has also been cut to a third of its value of five years ago.We need to give more support to people who want to train and bring back the bursaries.The current pay structure means that some fantastic nurses are underpaid — and that some terrible nurses are overpaid.We need to smash the pay structure and let hospitals pay what they want to their nurses and not be confined by pay brackets, so that really good nurses are rewarded and bad nurses are not.That would make a big dference, because we all know how demoralising it is to work really hard and yet be paid the same as someone who doesn’t.Nursing involves long and unsociable hours. All too often it involves having dinner at breakfast time. Nurses need to be offered more financial reward for working night shts.How will this money be raised  For a start, the NHS needs to make efficiencies, such as central buying and not give out vanity boob jobs and other medically unnecessary procedures.It needs to start charging peoplethey miss a GP appointment without good cause, and there should be means testing for patients over the age of  before they get free prescriptions.The country is run by unsung heroes — police, doctors, teachers and nurses. They are the foundation of this country and we can’t live without them.The repercussions of continuing to treat nurses with the lack of respect that we currently show them will be many, ied and severe.Let’s not find that out the hard way.RESEARCH showing that attractive women bosses are considered less truthful and trustworthy by both sexes is so depressing.As well as thinking that a pretty female boss is less likely to be honest, apparently both men and women also think they are more deserving of being fired than a less attractive counterpart.The implication is that any woman who shatters the glass ceiling is perceived to have used underhand methods to get there.How sad.And how far away from all of our hope that we are judged on our work, not our looks.I’M a big believer that it’s not what happens to you in le that matters so much as how you respond to it.But sometimes things happen that would make most of us want to crawl into a hole and hide.I have maximum respect for Londoner Zoe Parsons, , who has managed to turn her experience of domestic violence into something truly positive.When she told her husband, Edson Peart, that she didn’t want to have sex with him, his response was to rape her violently on a regular basis.He told her: “I own you.”After she plucked up the courage to leave him – a hugely brave act in itself – Peart broke into her house and attacked her, leaving Zoe needing stitches.Justice has now been served and Peart has been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison.Zoe has trained as a le coach, helping other survivors of domestic violence – which affects one in four women and leads to two women being killed each week.Astonishingly, marital rape was only recognised as a criminal offence in .This story is a necessary reminder that some men still misguidedly think they “own” women – and that marriage makes a woman their own personal property.For a start, private companies can pay their bosses whatever they like, as the pay comes out of the shareholders’ profits.And what MPs fail to realise is that these bosses give  per cent of whatever they earn back to the country in tax.So actually we should all be thanking God for them and the contribution they make to society, rather than making them feel bad about the money they take home.MPs might not like it but, frankly, as they seem incapable of doing their jobs at the moment, they are in no position to moan about people who get paid a large salary for doing a job well.What happened to the aspiration in this country MOSES ETTIENNE was jailed this week for claiming nearly £, from the taxpayer , in accommodation and living expenses, after saying he was living in Grenfell Tower when the fire broke out, despite giving the authorities who approved his payout a non-existent flat address.How on earth is this possible, surely an address is something simple to check Quite rightly he was jailed for five years after taking money that was set aside to help those who really needed it. Scum of the earth.But spare a thought for those for whom it’s not.I’ll be spending a quiet day with my kids and my mum.I don’t want any fancy chocolates, gts, cards or presents.Just a cup of tea in bed and a cuddle from my two kids... who can’t get their heads around the fact I have a mummy as well.VERY pleased to see that trend predictor Marian Salzman, , says the “age proud” movement is on the rise in .“Gone are the days when women lied about these things,” she says. “If you don’t say your age you look dated.”I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I make a point of never lying about my age. I am  next month – and proud.Andpeople ever say that I don’t look my age, I say: “But this is what  looks like!”WHY, when anything good happens in this country, do some people just want to whine Yet critics carp that it should be eligible only for Best International Programme, as the series first aired in the US.Shut up!It’s a British production and well worth celebrating.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Either way, it will transform the poll.Labour votes will be mopped up in Leave seats by Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, what’s left of Ukip, or, in Remain seats, by Labour deserters now known as Change UK.The picture is dferent for the Tories, depending upon when any poll is held and what happens in the next few weeks.A snap election, apparently to be announced on Wednesday, would be suicidal. Anything led by Theresa May would be a bloodbath.Under a new pro-Brexit leader, with breathing space to regroup, it could be an opportunity to clear the air once and for all. Meanwhile, we face further Commons chaos, showdowns with Brussels, the possibility of fighting European elections in May — and the outside chance of “crashing out”.No Deal is no big deal, as ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told The Sun last week — at least for Britain. We would swtly overcome a short, bumpy ride.Not so for Europe — and for all their bluster, EU states are beginning to fear it happening by accident.Germany is grimly aware it is about to lose the UK as a long-standing ally in the balance of European power with France and the EU’s hard-up southern states.Without our £billion-a-year contribution — one of the biggest by EU states — Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece will be queuing in Berlin for German cash.Unless a deal on frictionless trade is reached, German exporters will be hammered and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in their manufacturing industry.Support for “populist” parties — including in Germany — has mushroomed since the UK voted Leave.Which explains this week’s dash to Dublin by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She wants preening Irish PM Leo Varadkar to stop playing games and solve the Irish backstop question.Either he bows to technological solutions to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland or there will be a hard border at Calais with Ireland on the wrong side.Merkel knows a solution to the backstop problem would persuade the DUP to support Mrs May’s Withdrawal Bill, and even push it over the line at the fourth time of asking.That, in turn, would be enough to persuade all but the most stubborn Tories to sign up and, along with a few extra Labour votes, bring this edition of the long-running Brexit soap to a close.As always with these negotiations, nothing is settled until everything is settled, always at the th hour. It is now .pm and ticking.Let’s hope the Irish Taioseach put his clocks forward yesterday.He needs results fast. In yet another bloody incident, four innocent civilians were kned at random in North London, apparently by the same man. But kne murders are sometimes little more than initiation rites.Stop and search by itself is not enough.

Prosecutors believed Adnan had been jealous over his exs new relationship.The -year-old, who has always maintained his innocence, was jailed for le and his story was made famous around the world thanks to smash hit podcast, Serial.But a bombshell new HBO documentary, The Case Against Adnan Syed, could prove his innocence as it reveals new forensic tests found no traces of Adnans DNA on samples taken from Haes body.There were also no traces on samples obtained from the girls car during the investigation into the murder, according to the documentary, which will air on Sky Atlantic tonight.But in the four-part docu-series, questions are raised over two other men who were also investigated by police after Haes body was found on February , .One of these is Alonzo Sellers, the maintenance worker who told officers he discovered the students corpse after pulling over for a wee in Baltimore’s Leakin Park.The other is Don Clinedinst, who was Haes boyfriend at the time of her death and who failed to call police back for hours on the night she went missing.Referred to only as Mr S in the Serial podcast, Sellers reportedly had a criminal past, having been charged with indecent exposure more than once.In a new audio recording featured in the programme, he describes the grisly moment he came across Haes body weeks after she vanished on January  that year.He tells the authorities he was driving and drinking a Budweiser that he had grabbed from his fridge when he felt the need to urinate and pulled over.He says he went further into the woods so no-one could see him and was about to pee when he glanced down to see something that looked like hair.He looked down again. And that’s when I seen what looked like a foot, he says in the recording.Sellers briefly became a suspect in the case, as questions were raised over why he had walked nearly  feet to the area where he discovered Haes body.In the documentary, Detective Darryl Massey, who was secondary detective on the Syed case, is asked whether he believes Sellers found the body the way he did.Det Massey replies: Im not going to support that he didnt - dont think he wasnt looked at.I certainly understood some prior documented issues.He adds that that in itself doesnt make him a killer - it makes him an unusual person.The detective also comments on questions surrounding Clinedinst.Dont think he didnt go uninvestigated, Det Massey says in the new series.Clinedinst, who was dating Hae at the time, claimed to have been at work at a LensCrafters branch at the time of her murder - something which the manager confirmed.However, the documentary reveals the manager was also his mother.Rabia Chaudry, attorney and family friend of Syed, says: His alibi was really his mom.Speaking to Oxygen, Chaudry claimed that police quickly honed in on Adnan as a suspect, but didnt think, Maybe we should check the boyfriend.She alleged that officers didnt take any fingerprints or hair samples from Clinedinst, even though the hair found on Haes body didnt match Adnans DNA.She also notes in the documentary that on the night Hae vanished, Clinedinst couldnt be contacted via phone by police until .am - despite claiming he had got home at about pm.That’s like a big gap. Where was he  she questions.Clinedinst told filmmakers he wont spend time worrying about whether anybody believes his alibi.Meanwhile, Det Massey says of the alibi: Would a mother lie for him  Sure. He could have caught equal attention that the defendant did but he didnt have any phone calls come in about him.On February , several days after Hae was found dead, police received an anonymous call.They were told they should concentrate on the victims ex-boyfriend, Adnan.A sporty and well-liked young man, Adnans family hadnt let him hang out with or date girls, with female friends knowing that they couldnt call his home phone.Because of this, he would visit Hae at nighttime and speak to her through the window.Former schoolmate Debbie Warren describes their relationship as sweet and young love.However, despite once writing that she loved Adnan to death, Hae became desperate to have a normal relationship where she could spend time with her boyfriends family.She had been lying to her own family and felt like she had lost herself.She broke up with Adnan, now , in December  and later began dating Clinedinst.However, within a matter of weeks, she had vanished after leaving high school.The docu-series reveals the devastating impact of her disappearance on her mother.Family friend Sun Hee Lee says [Haes mum] was just lying in her room like a dead person when she heard her daughter was missing.The lasting impact on Adnans family is also explored in the programme who continue to support him.Speaking in the new documentary, his younger brother, Yusuf Syed, says: When Adnan went to prison it was like a big piece of all of us had died.Earlier this month, Adnan was denied a new trial by Marylands highest court - reversing a court decision from last year.And even as the latest evidence sheds new light on the high-profile case, police and prosecutors are standing by their conclusions.A spokeswoman for the Maryland Attorney General’s Office said the DNA results in no way exonerate Adnan.All four episodes of Sky Atlantic’s The Case Against Adnan Syed are now available to watch on NOW TVOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bodyguard came from the off-cuts of Line Of Duty and it should be eternally grateful for the association.Line Of Duty is a television masterpiece and the opening episode of the fth series was a genuine TV event that, despite a whf of plot familiarity, had me reeled in before the end of the opening credits.That was as long as it took the show to introduce Stephen Graham, who’s giving a mesmerising performance as Detective Sergeant John Corbett, the UCOwho appears to have gone rogue with an OCG .There are lots of other new faces as well, including: A gang of bikers, with no bikes, who appear to have been styled by Vyvyan from The Young Ones.Slippery police spokesman Sindwhani, played by Ace Bhatti. PC Jane Cafferty, whose le was spared in the opening hijack scene by “gangster” Lisa McQueen.And the slightly robotic Detective Superintendent Alison Powell, who’s in charge of Corbett’s “Operation Peartree” and is yet another of those department chiefs who seems strangely drawn to “Ted” .A hell of a trick for a TV show to pull off, introducing them all while still tying up the loose ends of series four and leaving viewers to guess which painkillers managed to get DS Arnott out of that wheelchair and whether Hastings’ faulty hotel toilet cistern is critical to the new plot. Or just a faulty hotel toilet cistern.The fact Line Of Duty did it, however, is entirely down to the constants that have driven this show ever since its first series.It starts, obviously, with a thrilling and complex script from Jed Mercurio, who clearly gives not a stuff for any of the lazy, modern, right-on conventions of TV writing.It’s all about the story that demands the total attention of the viewers and gets the performance of their lives from the actors.Not just the newcomers, like Stephen Graham, but regulars Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, as Arnott and Fleming, who have the hardest job in drama, unravelling the plot for the audience.Without them there would be no room for the show’s crowning glory, Super-intendent Ted Hastings, who is that rarest thing in contemporary TV drama, a strong male lead.There used to be lots of them, obviously. Now we’re generally reduced to murderers, rapists or, at best, jaw-flexing “Yes, ma’am” dogsbodies, like in Bodyguard.The joy of Hastings is that the part gets the performance it deserves from Adrian Dunbar, who’s from Northern Ireland, so he was born sardonic and can give a whole new edge to lines like: “Listen Alison. I didn’t float up the Lagan on a bubble.”Together, show and actor are a dream to watch and should be the agenda-free blueprint every new drama aims to emulate.So enjoy Hastings and Line Of Duty while you can.

It was like a horror movie.She was riding in circles on turtle mode on my brothers old go kart. It was going slow enough that we could walk right beside her.I was walking in front of her when I suddenly heard screaming.When Lani let her head fall back her hair became trapped in the motor belt behind her and it pulled her whole head back.The right side of her scalp was just hanging off. It was ripped from the front all the way to the nape of her neck.She was drting in and out of consciousness and her eyes were rolling into the back of her head.My mum was screaming at someone to get a kne or scissors.My stepdad physically cut her hair with a kne.The ambulance was taking so long that we bundled her into a car and brought her to the hospital which was a mile away.We had to hold her scalp to her head with a towel because you could see her skull and her brain.Her injuries were too serious for the hospital to handle and she was airlted to New Orleans almost immediately.Lani was booked into surgery the next morning and it was a really dficult night.She was in the ICU and her heart rate was dropping, as well as her oxygen levels.They were trying to keep her up because when she fell asleep her vitals went nuts. I thought I would lose her.The five-year-old pulled through the complex surgery but doctors were unable to determine the long term extent of her brain damage.Since the accident, Lani experiences small focal seizures up to three times a day which doctors are currently investigating.The kindergartener, who ed to school in December, struggles with weakness on her left side due to nerve damage and has trouble with her vision.Macie, a loan specialist, said: She has little seizures everyday which doctors are investigating.She just stares into space for a few minutes and feels very tired afterwards.We have an appointment in April about this but it is likely something she will cope with for le.Her EEG in January said her brain activity was abnormal which is worrying but we have to take each day as it comes and do the best we can for her.Macie said Lanis personality has changed since the accident and she is awaiting an appointment with a therapist to help her cope with post traumatic stress.Macie said: After the accident she was really depressed. She cried a lot and she didnt like how she looked. It was heartbreaking.Lani loved dancing and cheering before the accident. She has to be careful now with her brain injury. She cant tumble and loud noises scare her.She doesnt want to be too far away from us at any point.The couple warned parents to take safety precautions around go karts and make sure their children are wearing helmets with their hair safely tied up.Macie said: We live in Louisiana and riding go karts and four wheelers is just something we do here.After the accident I would not be comfortable with her riding one herself. I had tied her hair into a bun that day but it came loose.I would make sure childrens hair is tied up securely and they are wearing a helmet.

Most people around the table now buy that, because its where the public are.”Only International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt are on resignation watch over the customs union fallback, after the Cabinets other Brexiteers were said to have begrudgingly accepted.Ahead of the showdown Cabinet meeting, Mrs May was lobbied by delegations of worried ministers from both sides of the Tory party’s gaping Brexit ide yesterday.One Brexiteer Cabinet minister told The Sun: “We have to go back to Brussels and ask the EU to improve the backstop next week.“All we can do now is take this to the wire. Every other course will be a disaster.“The EU desperately want a deal. We just haven’t pushed them hard enough on this yet.“Andthey say no, then it will be the EU who are throwing us out.”EU leaders will hold an emergency Brexit summit on April  to hear any British plea for a long delay, just two days before the new exit date next Friday.The option to confront them was discussed by the ‘Pizza Club’ of Brexiteer ministers during conference call over the weekend, The Sun has also learned.But it would involve defying Parliamentrebel MPs manage to turn their soft Brexit bid for a customs union or Norway-style EEA membership into law.In separate trips to Downing Street yesterday, Leave-backing ministers lead by DexEU’s Chris Heaton-Harris urged Mrs May not to apply for any long extension to Article  and leave by the end of next month no matter what.A separate delegation of six Remain ministers, lead by Prisons Minister Rory Stewart, also saw Mrs May to plead with her to accept the softer Brexit outcome of the indicative vote process.One senior Cabinet Minister confirmed a new nationwide poll would be on the agenda for their discussion today.He said: When youve got a hung parliament an Election is an unavoidable part of the conversation.But there is believed to be widespread opposition to an election across the Cabinet from all groups within it, with one dubbing going to the country without delivering Brexit first as “very dangerous”.Another Cabinet minister said they expected Mrs May to end tomorrow with a bid to “play for more time”, but they added: “There isn’t any”.Also on another frantic day in Westminster:The plan favoured by No aides is to table her Brexit deal in a run off against the indicative vote process’s winning option, on Wednesday or Thursday.They hope the direct threat of a soft Brexit such as a custom union will finally force enough hardline Brexiteers to switch their votes and pass it.But the PM has been warned thatshe enters the run off, she would then be duty-bound to accept the outcome and implement whatever option wins it.ANOTHER farcical Commons stalemate. But at last ­Labour has picked a side: It chose Remainers — and threw its Leave voters under the Brexit bus.They wanted immigration control: Corbyn says No. They wanted freedom from EU courts: Corbyn says No.They wanted to stop paying Brussels billions: Corbyn says No. They wanted control over our economic future: Corbyn says No. They wanted MPs to respect the referendum: Corbyn says No.In fact, he now wants a second vote.Labour finally turned against Brexit by backing the deviously mistitled “Common Market .”. It is tempting to think some MPs supported it, and the permanent customs union, as an April Fool. But it was mainly cynical calculation, or in some cases rank stupidity.Labour just wants to wreck the Tories.Other dim MPs considered these positions “compromises”. More cunning Remainers suspect either is a route back to EU membership. In fact they would trigger a clamour to do Brexit properly.“Common Market .” effectively means staying in the EU without any say.Permanent customs union robs the world’s fth largest economy of an independent trading future. Take back control  We’d have permanently surrendered the control we have.The Tory ERG can threaten to collapse their own Government over Theresa May’s deal, sacricing their jobs, becoming Brexit martyrs.

On Wednesday, the UK has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.” But thereaposs another option - a long delay. And there are just  days left until an emergency EU summit to decide where to go next. The summit will come just two days before the new departure date of April  - when Theresa May faces  choices. Either crash out of the EU without a deal revoke Article  to cancel Brexit or agree a long delay with  leaders. Those options could trigger a national crisis, a new Prime Minister or a general election. Here are  fast facts you need to know this Tuesday morning.  Prime Minister Theresa May has four hours to decide Britainaposs future as she holds two back-to-back, marathon Cabinet meetings on how to process last nightaposs result. The crisis talks were due to start with a three hour political Cabinet meeting from am, and after lunch, a two-hour Cabinet meeting from pm to pm. The political Cabinet meeting was later shortened to .am to .am. Expect leaks galore after the formal session finally breaks up, with Cabinet members warring over the truly existential question of where to go next with Brexit. Sources have told todayaposs newspapers it will be the mother of all Cabinet meetings, a hell of a ding-dong, and a really big moment. According to ITV, ministers will be shown private polling on the Toriesapos prospects in any snap election. With things deadlocked, the Times reports that Chancellor Philip Hammond will use todayaposs Cabinet showdown to call for a second EU referendum. This is a big moment. . A long delay and EU elections look more likely  Last night MPs failed to agree any of four options for Brexit - a customs union Common Market . second referendum and revoking Article . That means a long delay to Brexit has become much more likely, with Education Secretary Damian Hinds branding it absolutely a risk and a big looming risk at the moment. Any delay will mean holding elections to the European Parliament at the end of May. Theresa May could of course choose No Deal. But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the Commons last night a delay is more possible than ever. He said approving Theresa Mayaposs deal in a FOURTH vote - expected later this week - it may still be possible to avoid holding European Parliamentary elections. Appearing to rule out no deal Brexit , he said: The only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal.  EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier today warned a long extensionwould carry signicant risks for the EU - and said he might not grant a delaythe UK hasnapost come up with a plan. The Brussels negotiator added: Therefore a strong justication would be needed. Many businesses in the EU warn us against the cost of extending uncertainty. There would also be a political cost. The UK should now indicate the way forward or indicate a plan, Barnier added. More today than ever.  Tory MP Nick Boles emotionally quit the Conservative Party over Brexit in a dramatic House of Commons walkout. The former minister was applauded by Labour and Lib Dem MPs as he strode out the door of the historic chamber - when his alternative Brexit plan was defeated for a second time. Close to tears, he told MPs: I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. Meanwhile Conservative backbencher Richard Drax announced heaposd switch BACK against the deal. In a brutal Commons statement, the South Dorset MP said Theresa May must resignshe cannot deliver Brexit. And Brexiteer Mark Francois went even more rogue than usual, bringing up Mr Bolesapos cancer fight and telling the Chancellor aposup yoursapos in a string of charged media interviews.  The UKaposs top civil servant has sent a bombshell letter to ministers warning No Deal would harm the police and security services and lead to theof direct rule in Northern Ireland. Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, sent the -page letter to ministers according to extracts leaked to the Daily Mail.

Guy Verhofstadt and Michel Barnier sounded the alarm as Theresa May held a four-hour Cabinet showdown to discuss delaying Brexit - or crashing out without an agreement. Britain is deadlocked just days before the April  date of leaving after MPs rejected four indicative vote options for the future last night.  EU leaders will now be summoned to an emergency summit in eight daysapos time to discuss delaying Brexit. But EU chiefs today warned such a long delay would not be approved without a clear new plan from the UK. And not only has the UK failed to draw up a new plan - it doesnapost even knowit wants to ask for a delay yet.    Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentaposs Brexit chief, warned last night: A hard Brexit becomes nearly inevitable. On Wednesday, the UK has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.” Theresa May is expected to put her three-times-defeated Brexit plan before MPs yet again in the coming days. But Friday is thought to be the last chance to pass it. So the Cabinet is poised for an almighty clash today over the binary choice of No Deal, or a delayed Brexit.  Mrs May previously said she would not approve a delay as PM. Yet a bombshell leaked letter to ministers today warns a No Deal Brexit would bring catastrophe to much of the country - with % price hikes, a recession and direct rule in Northern Ireland. Theresa May is likely to face a torrent of resignations whichever option she chooses.  European Commission Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK now had two options - quit the EU without a deal, or seek a long delay. He said no deal becomes day after day more likely. Mr Barnier said: The UK may ask for another extension. Such an extension would carry signicant risks for the EU. Therefore a strong justication would be needed. He added: As things stand no the option of no deal looks very likely. I have to be very sincere with you. We have prepared for no deal. Itaposs not the option I would have gone for.  You donapost need a negotiator for no deal, do you  You need a negotiator for a deal. And thataposs what weaposve done. But we are prepared. Weaposve done some serious preparation for this over a number of months now. Mr Barnier said the EU had always said it could accept a customs union, or a aposNorwayapos-style soft Brexit. MPs voted down both options but only by narrow margins last night. He added we are ready to rework the Political Declaration, part of the Brexit deal,the UK wanted to make soft Brexit happen. But he warned: If the UK wishes to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, thereaposs only one treaty available - this one.  The vice-president of the European Parliament has said it does look like a no-deal Brexit is nearly inevitable. Mairead McGuinness told BBC Breakfast: When you look at the timelines, there is concern here in the European Union that the failure of the House of Commons to rally around any particular option leaves us with that thought. That there is this lurching, perhaps by accident, towards a no-deal scenario. She added that, while a no-deal Brexit was not the desire of the EU, these things can happen by accident rather than design. Prime Minister Theresa May has four hours to decide Britainaposs future as she holds two back-to-back, marathon Cabinet meetings on how to process last nightaposs result.  The crisis talks were due to start with a three hour political Cabinet meeting from am, and after lunch, a two-hour Cabinet meeting from pm to pm. The political Cabinet meeting was later shortened to .am to .am. With things deadlocked, the Times reports that Chancellor Philip Hammond would use todayaposs Cabinet showdown to call for a second EU referendum.  But that would prompt a torrent of resignations from Tory Brexiteers. Former minister David Davis saidthe Cabinet chooses a long delay it would be seen as a route to stop Brexit, adding of the Conservative Party: It would tear it apart. He added: You would see some bleeding away of people. More signicantly in immediate terms you would almost certainly have a leadership election of one sort or another very very quickly. And a new leader. And I think then all bets are off. It starts again, this process.  It came after Tory MP Nick Boles emotionally quit the Conservative Party over Brexit in a dramatic House of Commons walkout. The former minister was applauded by Labour and Lib Dem MPs as he strode out the door of the historic chamber - when his alternative Brexit plan was defeated for a second time.

I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise.  Reports suggested overnight that Mrs May could bring back her Brexit deal for a fourth vote by MPs - but this time make it a confidence issue. This would mean any Tory MP voting against the deal would also be voting down the government. Mr Davis claimed up to  Tory MPs could vote down the government in this case. Mr Davis - who stood for the Tory leadership more than a decade ago and lost to David Cameron - did not rule himself out as a potential leadership candidate. He said: People have been coming up to me for months on this. Even last night. It came as the prospect of indicative votes to decide Brexitaposs future looked dead in the water as MPs failed to reach consensus.  Last night MPs failed to agree any of four options for Brexit - a customs union Common Market . second referendum and revoking Article . The customs union failed by just  votes while Common Market . failed by just . That led to bitter recriminations against some Remainer MPs, including the Independent Group, who refused to compromise by supporting soft Brexit.

Theresa Mayaposs Cabinet will now meet in the morning to digest the drama before MPs are once again expected to vote on her Brexit deal. Hereaposs where the deadlock sits after tonightaposs drama.  MPs seized control of Commons agenda after Theresa Mayaposs deal was voted down three times. And they used the time to hold indicative votes on four dferent alternative options for Brexit.Two of them were plans for a softer Brexit - either a Customs Union, or the aposCommon Market .apos plan, also known as Norway Plus.The third was for a second EU referendum to let the public confirm any deal MPs agree, or Remain in the EU instead. And the fourth was to revoke Article , the protocol that began the two-year countdown to leaving the EU, in order to hold a public inquiry on whether Brexit should continue. But Brexit was hurled into chaos as not a single one of the options won a Commons majority. Tonightaposs result doesnapost mean the plans are dead at all, but it means no clear way forward has emerged. Results in full Common Market .: FOR  AGAINST  Customs Union: FOR  AGAINST  Second referendum: FOR  AGAINST  Revoke Article : FOR  AGAINST  Tory former minister Nick Boles emotionally quit the party moments after the results were announced. The MP was applauded by Labour and Lib Dem MPs after he quit the Conservative Party after his Brexit alternative plan was defeated for a second time. The architect of the Common Market . plan told MPs: I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party.  Itaposs prompted new bitter isions in Parliament Bitter Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois gave Chancellor Philip Hammond the message up yours, before adding not so charitably: Iaposm not going to criticise Nick Boles because he fought off cancer.Meanwhile there were angry scenes as Independent Group MP Anna Soubry defended her decision to stick to the pure choice of a second referendum.If she and her  aposTIGapos colleagues had backed a softer Brexit, we would have got a majority for a softer Brexit. But they didnapost - a decision that will enrage other Remainers in the House of Commons. What happens next   The next few days will now be crucial.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May has five hours to save her career as she holds two back-to-back, marathon Cabinet meetings on how to process the result.On Wednesday or Thursday she could put her deal back to MPs in a farcical FOURTH vote. But unlike the first three, this could pitch her option against the one that comes out on top with MPs. Meanwhile, MPs could try and force the Prime Minister to accept the result by laying legislation in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Something has to be chosen by Wednesday  April - which is when  EU leaders will hold an emergency summit to decide what to do next. If Theresa Mayaposs deal hasnapost passed, she will have three choices - crash out of the EU with no deal revoke Article  and cancel Brexit or negotiate a long delay to leaving. What soft Brexit plans are on the table  Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke proposed a customs union which means the UK would be able to continue trading freely with the remaining  member states without any checks or duties on goods.It also means all the countries in the EU set the same tarfs on imports from non-EU countries. But its critics say that it would prevent the UK from striking independent trade deals. It lost by  votes.“Norway Plus” would allow close ties to the EU, not as full members but in the single market.It commits us to free movement of people but with an “emergency brake” and we would still have to make reduced contributions to the EU budget. It lost by  votes.  No. Eventhey had got a majority the indicative votes were not legally binding. But with her own deal voted down three times the PM would struggle to ignore Parliamentthey finally agreed on an alternative way forward. She has previously dismissed the prospect of a customs union, but Downing Street yesterday did not rule it out, simply suggesting it was not in the “national interest”. MPs could still try to force their preferred option into law on Wednesday. What does this mean for Theresa May’s deal   It is almost dead, but not quite.The PM still has a huge mountain to climb as she needs to win  more votes from a combination of hardline Brexiteers, the DUP and Labour backbenchers with Leave seats.None are looking like they will budge. MPs are expecting her to have a fourth go at getting her deal through this week.There are also suggestions of a potential run-off between the PM’s deal and a soft Brexit in a bid to focus the minds of rebellious Tory backbenchers.Can the Tory party survive   If Parliament seizes control on Wednesday, forcing the Government to go back to renegotiate the future relationship with Brussels, it would trigger a major crisis in the Tory party.The majority of Tory MPs -  including ten ministers - signed a letter at the weekend saying they would prefer a damaging No Deal Brexit to a softer one.Whichever way the PM turns she faces internal chaos - resignations, splits and even more calls for her to step down immediately. Does it increase the chances of a general election     Most Tory MPs are firmly against a poll to break the deadlock. But No  will keep the option on the table to encourage Brexiteer rebels to back the PM’s deal. However, Parliament would have to vote for it by a two thirds majority - currently looking like a big ask.Jeremy Corbyn could call another no confidence vote in the Government, which could mean another election anywaya handful of Tories back him.The EU will only grant another extension to Brexitthe UK has a firm plan - which could include a general election.

The week which saw a resident in Walthamstow, East London, so fed up at the lack of police in his area, that he stood outside what used to be his local cop shop and took a photo in front of it, smoking something he shouldn’t have.  “Police are useless,” said Courtney Barratt. “They wait for a crime to happen and solve it later.” Don’t forget too, the high street in Swansea where businesses are leaving because the pavements are unsafe after pm. “People are shutting up shop and no-one cares,” said one entrepreneur. “The criminals have won.” Enter Sajid Javid to launch his Tory leadership bid war on kne crime by targeting – instead of supporting – teachers, NHS and youth workers, warning they could be punishedthey fail to spot potential offenders.

Having demanded the right to take control of the process MPs have found it as dficult as Theresa May to break the deadlock. The indicative votes only indicated there is no majority for any form of Brexit. This is not quite the end of the process. They will seek to have another go on Wednesday in the vain attempt to reach a consensus.  There is still a possibility that Ken Clarkeaposs plan for a customs union, which lost by only three votes, could win the day. So far the exercise has only proved to underline how the toxin of Brexit has now entered the bloodstream of the two major parties, poisoning friendships and sapping traditional loyalties.    You could say MPs have finally proved they are in touch with the rest of the country – they are as ided on the issue as anyone . Mrs May will no doubt have greeted the results with a wry smile.  Her deal is not the only unpopular option on the table. But the Prime Minister still appears to have no plan for delivering a Brexit that can command the support of MPs. The chance of getting her deal through at a fourth attempt remains close to zero while the DUP refuses to budge and a diehard group of Tory Brexiteers refuse to take yes for an answer. Mrs May can neither tack towards a softer Brexit because it would split her party nor can she allow a no deal Brexit because it would provoke a Cabinet revolt. A general election could either see Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street oranother hung Parliament still unable to solve the Brexit riddle. There are no good choices facing the Prime Minister. Whichever one she chooses will come with a hefty political price.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UKaposs most senior civil servant, says leaving the EU without a deal would hamper the police and security services, threaten national security, force companies to accept bailouts and undermine the Irish peace process. Quitting the EU without any sort of trade deal and relying on WTO rules, a move backed by ERG hardliners and some members of the cabinet, would also see a % spike in food prices. The letter emerged as EU chiefs warned the UK is facing the abyss with a No Deal looking more likely by the day. Guy Verhofstadt and Michel Barnier sounded the alarm after MPs rejected four indicative vote options for the future last night - leaving Britain in Brexit deadlock. Theresa May is now holding a four-hour Cabinet showdown to discuss either delaying Brexit or crashing out without an agreement on the April  deadline.  The -page leaked letter, sent by Sir Mark ahead of a cabinet showdown, gives other stark warnings about the reality of crashing out on April ...A recession would hit the UK and the poundaposs depreciation will be aposmore harmfulapos than  Legal authorities and judicial system put under aposenormous pressureapos % spike in food prices and collapse of some businesses that trade with EU Government would come under pressure to bail out companies on the brink Hamper the ability of police and security services to keep people safe Reintroduction of direct rule in Northern Ireland for the first time since Theresa May originally summoned the cabinet for a five-hour meeting to try and thrash out an achievable Brexit plan that will carry the support of the House of Commons. This morning it was announced itsand ambition had been slashed.  Last night, for the second time, MPs failed to back any alternative arrangements for leaving the EU in an indicative vote which failed to give any strong indications for a way forward through the gridlock. MPs have also rejected Theresa Mayaposs Withdrawal Agreement three times and voted against No Deal Brexit and against revoking Article .  The cabinet session today will start with a meeting of the apospolitical cabinetapos where ministers could discuss the prospect of a General Election. The Daily Mail reports that Sir Markaposs doomsday letter was sent to every member of the Cabinet last week. It will now be kept in Government files and could be released should a public inquiry be held into the handling of Brexit, which most polls show the public think politicians have bungled. The newspaper quote the letter as saying: A No Deal exit would enormously increase pressure on our law and security authorities and on our judicial system. The UK would be less safe as a result of this.  The paper claims a source said that Sir Markaposs warning on Northern Ireland has convinced the Prime Minister she could not risk taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Despite the grave warnings  Tory MPs, including  members of the cabinet, have urged Theresa May to take the UK out of the EU next week - evenshe canapost pass a deal. The Daily Mail says those ministers were Andrea Leadsom, Steve Barclay, Penny Mordaunt, Geoffrey Cox, Gavin Williamson, Brandon Lewis, Sajid Javid, Liz Truss, Chris Grayling and Alun Cairns.    Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said he had previously seen some of the same warnings in private briefings as a privy counsellor. But the Tory MP told the BBC he thought the warnings were ridiculous and a complete Whitehall scare story. A No official said about Sir Markaposs leaked letter: We donapost comment on leaks.  EU leaders will now be summoned to an emergency summit in eight daysapos time to discuss delaying Brexit. But EU chiefs today warned such a long delay would not be approved without a clear new plan from the UK.  And not only has the UK failed to draw up a new plan - it doesnapost even knowit wants to ask for a delay yet. Theresa May is expected to put her three-times-defeated Brexit plan before MPs yet again in the coming days. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentaposs Brexit chief, warned last night: A hard Brexit becomes nearly inevitable. On Wednesday, the UK has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.” Long delay or No Deal, Theresa May is likely to face a torrent of resignations whichever option she chooses.  Former minister David Davis saidthe Cabinet chooses a long delay it would be seen as a route to stop Brexit, adding of the Conservative Party: It would tear it apart. He added: You would see some bleeding away of people. More signicantly in immediate terms you would almost certainly have a leadership election of one sort or another very very quickly. And a new leader. And I think then all bets are off. It starts again, this process.  With Brexit deadlocked, the Times reported Chancellor Philip Hammond would use todayaposs Cabinet meeting to call for a second EU referendum. European Commission Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK now had two options - quit the EU without a deal, or seek a long delay. He said no deal becomes day after day more likely. Mr Barnier said: The UK may ask for another extension. Such an extension would carry signicant risks for the EU. Therefore a strong justication would be needed. He added: As things stand no the option of no deal looks very likely. I have to be very sincere with you.  We have prepared for no deal. Itaposs not the option I would have gone for. You donapost need a negotiator for no deal, do you  You need a negotiator for a deal. And thataposs what weaposve done. But we are prepared. Weaposve done some serious preparation for this over a number of months now. Mr Barnier said the EU had always said it could accept a customs union, or a aposNorwayapos-style soft Brexit. MPs voted down both options but only by narrow margins last night. He added we are ready to rework the Political Declaration, part of the Brexit deal,the UK wanted to make soft Brexit happen. But he warned: If the UK wishes to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, thereaposs only one treaty available - this one.

There is no guarantee a general election would produce a radically dferent Parliament or a route forward but asking the people what they would like is better than any other option. In the meantime, we urge May in the days and weeks she has left in Downing Street to listen to MPs and stop offering herself as a hostage to hard-line Brexit no-dealers both in her own party and Northern Ireland’s DUP.     One of the tragedies of this ordeal is that votes like those tonightwere not called two years ago to try to find a consensus.

It is nothing more than rank hypocrisy The facts speak for themselves when May has issued marching orders to , police officers, punching holes in the thin blue line. Everybody has a role to play in ending this crisis, including educators and health workers.

The teenaposs ex-partner Simone McDermott and her new girlfriend - along with two other women - can be seen battering Aimee, who repeatedly pleads let me go in the disturbing footage. Aimee had been lured to the beating by McDermott, who also got new girlfriend Melissa Marriott to take part too, the Manchester Evening News reports.    After the four thugs avoided immediate jail sentences on Monday, Aimee released the footage of her ordeal to show the full horror of what had happened to her. The footage shows the violence dealt out by the thugs, including Marriott and McDermott, who had recruited her neighbour Siobhan Wait to join in. A fourth women, Victoria Houghton, filmed the violence on her phone. All the attackers were aged  at the time they punched and kicked Aimee, who lay curled up in the foetal position on the floor while they rained blows onto her head and body as they laughed and called her names.   Now aged  and a bartender, Aimee, from Denton, criticised the suspended sentences handed down by the judge and told the MEN: I wanted them to docustodial sentences. They were saying in court they are young and that they have been through stuff but Iaposve been through stuff. I donapost go around battering people or jumping on people or even being mean to people.Iaposm annoyed about . I just donapost think justice has been fully served. She described how she was visiting her mother in Spain when she learned that her partner McDermott had dumped her.    It was like,thataposs what you want then fair enough, said Aimee. McDermott, she said, then sent her pictures of her in bed with her new partner Marriott. Sheaposs not a nice person, Aimee added. Manchester Crown Court heard McDermott lured her target Aimee, who was hopeful of a reunion, into a trap with a text that said aposI miss youapos. But Marriott led a brutal gang assault on her victim at a house in Crumpsall . Aimee is seen curled up in a ball as Marriott rained kicks and punches onto her head together with McDermott as they tried to snatch her phone and other attackers laughed.    Support worker McDermott and college student Marriott, now both , said they believed their victim had intimate pictures of them on her phone. Handing the four defendants suspended sentences at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Timothy Smith said Marriott had orchestrated a pre-planned, vicious, cowardly ambush and assault. McDermott and Marriott sobbed in the dock when they learned they would not be given immediate custodial sentences.    Prosecutor Katherine Pierpoint told how Aimee was in care in January  when she met McDermott, then also , when they were living in supported accommodation. The pair began a turbulent on-again-off-again relationship. But while Aimee was on holiday in Spain her lover began a new relationship with Marriott, then also , the court heard. The victim and McDermott were horrible to each other and would call each other names, according to the prosecutor.  Aimee bumped into her ex and Houghton, , on a tram at pm on January , . McDermott called her former partner names during a five-minute volley of abuse, prompting the victim to get off the tram. But that night McDermott contacted Aimee on Snapchat and apologised, adding she was depressed. She also lied, claiming that she had just split from Marriott.    McDermott askedshe could meet Aimee. When the suspicious victim askedshe was being set up, McDermott replied aposI miss you and she met her ex at a house in Crumpsall at am. The court heard Marriott led the attack, launching a series of Thai-boxing style kicks and stamping on the face of her victim. McDermott also kicked and stamped on her.    Houghton, a cleaner at Wythenshawe Hospital, kicked her in the head once while Wait kicked her legs and punched her twice to the back of the head. After being thrown out of the house, the victim dialled . Police found her on the street in an extremely distressed state. She was taken to hospital where a CT scan revealed no fractures, although she had signicant swelling to her forehead. The shocking video was replayed in court.    In a personal statement read to the court, Aimee, who now has a new girlfriend, said the assault left her too scared to leave her room and go out for three months and when she did finally venture out she had to have a friend with her. She said she struggles to sleep and suffers nose bleeds because of the repeated punches to her head. The court heard the injuries may have been worse had the attackers been wearing regular shoes rather than Ugg boots, which are slipper style footwear. Erimnaz Mushtaq, defending McDermott, said her client always accepted wrong-doing. She accepted it had been a deeply, deeply nasty incident but her client had believed the victimaposs phone had contained images of her. McDermott was deeply remorseful, it was said.    Brigid Baillie, defending Marriott, said her client acted because she believed the victim had aposintimate photosapos of her client on her phone and this seemed to wind her up. Her client had been suffering from mental health dficulties, the court was told. David Taylor, defending Houghton, pointed out her client was not the instigator of the attack and her actions had been totally out of character. His client was responsible for one kick during the attack and she had shown genuine remorse, he said, adding she she was totally ashamed and disgusted with herself. Mr Taylor said his client had not been in a physical relationship with any of the other defendants as she was not of that persuasion.  Patrick Williamson, defending Siobhan Wait, said his client had played a subordinate role amounting to one kick to a leg and one punch to the back of the head. At a sentencing hearing on Monday morning, Judge Timothy Smith handed McDermott and Marriott, both now , two years in a young offendersapos institution, suspended for two years. They were each ordered to carry out  hoursapos unpaid work and complete up to  days of rehabilitation activity. They were also ordered to pay their victim £ compensation each. Houghton was given  months, suspended for two years, in a young offendersapos institution.    Wait was given  months, suspended for two years, in a young offendersapos institution. Each of the four is required to complete  hoursapos unpaid work and must pay their victim £ compensation. All four were handed five-year restraining orders stopping them from making contact with Aimee. Marriott and McDermott, both of Gorton, admitted assault with intent to rob.

Kiara’s mother, Natasha Kinlan, has complained to police and has now spoken out in a bid to help catch the sick inidual responsible. Natasha, , from Springburn, Glasgow, said the mystery troll’s hate-filled messages are destroying her and her family. She said: “It’s sickened us. We have enough to think about without the extra stress of this.”    Little Kiara was diagnosed with brain cancer in January last year and despite undergoing a brain operation to clear away most of the cancer, doctors recently told her family there is nothing more they can do. Natasha said: “Kiara was diagnosed aged six after going into hospital with a shaky hand. The doctors found a five-centimetre brain mass and removed  per cent of it during a -hour operation. “This year, unfortunately, despite her ringing the bell at the hospital to say she was in recovery, we were told it had ed and was now at stage four. Doctors have told us she has only months to live.” Natasha and her partner Aldo Buonomo started to receive sick messages from the mystery sender shortly after Kiara’s diagnosis last year and they have continued ever since. Natasha said: “A couple of weeks after Kiara was diagnosed in January last year, we began to receive pictures on Snapchat saying ‘hurry up and die’ and they told us we were wasting NHS money. “They were calling Kiara ugly when she is clearly beautul.” Messages sent included a picture of Kiara with the caption: “Am dying yasss hurry up this time f* sake yous will never have to hear ma mongo horrible voice again.”  Another upsetting message said: “Ugly c*** Kiara will be deed soon.” The messages have continued over the last  months and have now become more sexually explicit in nature. Natasha said: “The way they are talking now is vile, about rape and other things. It is horrible. “I want these people brought to justice.” One of the messages suggested running over her brother AJay, .  Natasha said: “Kiara’s big sister Kayla has overheard conversations about the messages and was really upset. It’s making us feel sick.” The last message was received on Wednesday night when Kiara was rushed to hospital for an emergency operation. Natasha said: “Kiara had fluid on the brain last week and we didn’t knowshe was going to make it. We received the message when she was in theatre. “The person sending it clearly has something wrong with them. “The police are looking into this now and they have said they will charge whoever is guilty and take them to court.” Police Scotland said: “Police are aware of this and inquiries are ongoing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what happens you eat wetherspoons","story":"NewsWhat happens when you eat at Wetherspoons every day for a weekReporter Robin Murray ate at the pub every day for a week - Heres what he foundShareCommentsByRobin Murray:,  APR NewsThe Bristol Post reporter committed to a weeks worth of Spoons meals \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis year marks the th anniversary of a British institution. In  a then unknown Tim Martin opened his first pub aposMartinaposs Free Houseapos, opting to change the name to J.D.Wetherpoon a few weeks after an advertising board fell through the front window during a scuffle. Fast forward to  and Spoons is ubiquitous across the UK, employing , people in  branches.  It is clear that behind the chainaposs remarkable rise to high street power is its cheap drinks and long opening hours.But reporter Robin Murray, from The Mirroraposs sister paper The Bristol Post, attempted to get to the bottom of what  makes the chain so popular. Every day for a week he ate a dferent Bristol Spoons. Here is what he found out:    I should kick off by saying Iaposm a big fan of Spoons. It probably stems from a close relative of mine, whose main aim in le is to visit every J.D. Wetherspoon-owned pub in the country. Considering thereaposs around  of them, Iaposd say itaposs unlikely sheaposll manage it, but thataposs another story for another day. Anyway, given my admiration of the chain, you can probably imagine how quickly my hand shot up when my editor asked all the reporters in the office who would like to do a week-long review of Bristolaposs ious Spoons branches. Add that to the prospect of not having to make sandwiches every evening for a week, and I was well and truly sold. So without further ado, at lunchtime on Monday I left the office and headed to Tim Martinaposs empire for my first of five back-to-back visits, all in the name of research. There was plenty to find out: which is the best of all the clubs  Which Spoons has the best carpet  And how will eating at Spoons five days on the bounce make me feel  This is how I got on. It was a journey... Monday – aposChips cooked to perfectionapos   Spoons of choice:  The Commercial Rooms, Corn Street Meal:  Hummus and roasted vegetable wrap with chips and an orange Sanpellegrino .Given its prime location, Corn Streetaposs Wetherspoon restaurant is the chainaposs flagship Bristol branch, so it felt right to start my week here. Like many Spoons out there itaposs a grandiose building steeped in history, which somewhat juxtaposes what Spoons offers, some might say. Since there are no clubs on Mondays I thought Iaposd get the ball rolling with a veggie option before the unavoidable onslaught of meat came my way. And with a giant mural of Isambard Kingdom Brunel looming over me, I felt like I should order something a little more on the classy side to impress the big man. A hummus and vegetable wrap washed down with a San Pellegrino it was, then. Perhaps naively I thought I was going for a fairly healthy option by swerving a burger or something of that ilk, but my first thought as I bit into the wrap was salt. So much salt. Still, aside from that it wasnapost bad and I couldnapost help but enjoy the overall meal, especially as it came with the luxury of a San Pellegrino - arguably the most premium of all the fizzy beverages. And the chips were cooked to perfection, too - something which I later discovered isnapost always the case. For under a fiver I couldnapost really fault it. The Commercial Rooms got things off to a good start. Tuesday: Steak Club – aposPretty tasty but slightly greasyapos   Spoons of choice:  The Knights Templar, Temple Quay. Meal:  oz sirloin steak with chips and a pint of Shipyard American Pale Ale .This Spoons dfers from most others in Bristol, and indeed across the country, in that it doesnapost quite boast the same impressive architecture and could instead be mistaken as an office by passers-by,it were not for the neon green Spoons sign. Its location means it is often packed with workers from the cluster of nearby offices and commuters. When I went on Tuesday lunchtime there was just a smattering of lonesome diners - myself included. I was pleasantly surprised when the waitress behind the counter asked how Iaposd like my steak cooked, having gone in with the assumption a Spoons steak is a Spoons steak is a Spoons steak. But no, my slab of meat arrived promptlyand cooked as I had asked, and while it obviously wasnapost to the same standard as the cuts you get at the likes of The Ox, Mugshot or Pasture it was pretty tasty,not slightly on the greasy side. The chips were once again very enjoyable, the mushroom and peas were decent too, but the tomato was not. The pint of Shipyard, something youaposd often pay around £ for alone, made the £. fee an absolute steal. I was fairly impressed with the first club of the week. Wednesday: Chicken Club – aposFull yet disappointedapos  Spoons of choice:  The Berkeley, Park Street Meal:  Pulled chicken burger with chips and a pint of diet Pepsi .As a big poultry fan, Chicken Club was the one I was most looking forward to before I embarked on my Wetherspoon journey. The cycle across town to Park Street ramped up my hunger levels a notch or two and I was ravenous when I ordered my pulled chicken burger. My excitement was slightly dampened when I was informed that they had run out of the Jack Daniels honey glaze sauce a colleague had recommended. That was only a minor setback, however, compared with the awful chips that came with my burger. Unlike the previous two days they were disastrously undercooked and some were even stone cold. I probably should have mentioned something to one of the members of staff buzzing about but, given my hunger, I forced them down. The chicken was okay but covered in far too much barbecue sauce, and the bun it was served in was poor - barely toasted and a little on the stale side. I cycled back to the office, full yet disappointed. Chicken club had let me down. Thursday: Curry Club – Curry with a side of plastic Spoons of choice: Knights Templar, Temple Quay Meal: Rogan Josh with naan bread and poppadoms, washed down with a ginger beer . There was one key dference between my visit to the Knights Templar on Tuesday and my Thursday jaunt - on Tuesday there wasnapost a piece of plastic in my food. Yes, thataposs right, there I was happily enjoying my curry when I discovered a piece of plastic packaging underneath my naan bread.The irony is that I was just saying to my girlfriend, who had kindly joined me for lunch, it was the best Spoons meal Iaposd had all week thanks to succulent pieces of lamb and a tasty, perfectly spiced sauce. A minute before unearthing the unwanted item. Undeterred, I cracked on with the meal - having put the plastic to one side - and didnapost bother the waitress with a complaint, despite Rachael advising otherwise. J.D.Wetherspoon has since issued an apology, which is nice, and explained the packaging wasnapost used to wrap any of the mealaposs contents but instead came from a container in the kitchen. Friday: Fish Friday – The best food all week, but the worst service Spoons of choice:  The WG Grace, Whiteladies Road Meal:  Fish and chips with mushy peas and a pint of Brewdog Punk IPA .Before I get stuck into Fridayaposs review, I thought Iaposd describe my Thursday evening jog. I felt incredibly sluggish, having to stop for a walk after only about  minutes. Who knows, maybe it had nothing to do with the Spoons food but usually I feel much fitter when going for a run towards the end of the week, so by my reckoning it was probably the change in diet that made me feel like I was running with lead in my trainers. So thereaposs your aposscientic proofapos,you wanted it, that eating at Spoons every day doesnapost do wonders for your fitness levels. Anyway, The WG Grace proved to be hot and cold. It produced the best food I ate all week by a country mile, but was also where I found the poorest service.    Shortly after taking my seat, a waiter strolled past and plonked a plate of chicken wings in front of me. He was pretty much halfway across the restaurant before I could tell him they werenapost mine. Then a few minutes later a waitress askedthe wrap she was holding was what I had ordered. It wasnapost, so she took it back to the kitchen having not been able to locate its owner. And then, to complete the hat-trick of mishaps, my plate arrived with peas instead of the mushy peas I had ordered. The waitress wasnapost too happy about having to go and get it changed. However once my dish arrived- which I ordered using the impressive Wetherspoon app for the first time - it was top notch. The batter on the fish was nice and flaky and the chips were the best Iaposd eaten all week - far better than the soggy abominations I was served on Wednesday. After finishing my meal I felt a little bit sick, to be honest, and truly stuffed to the brim. I think I was done with Spoons by this point and could tell my body was craving some fruit and veg. What did I learn  The chips DO have an off-day The under-cooked, soggy excuses I was served at The Berkely proved this. More restaurants should adopt Spoonsapos approach to condiments I absolutely HATE those pathetic little pots of Ketchup and other sauces you get served at some restaurants, but at Spoons there are bottles of sauce filled to the brim everywhere you look - and not the cheap stuff, either. Bravo, Tim Martin, bravo.  Spoons carpets are WILD The carpets at Spoons are pretty impressive, arenapost they  I would love to know where they source them from.  Fish club is the best of all the clubs The fish and chips at The WG Grace were pretty darn good, it was just a shame about the shambolic service. Combined with a pint of Brewdog Punk IPA, it was my favourite meal of the week. Plastic and rogan josh isnapost a good combo Fortunately I didnapost eat the bit of plastic that was in my curry on Thursday afternoon, but it was still a little off-putting and made me question the care taken by kitchen staff.  Five days of Spoons isnapost conducive to a healthy lestyle This is hardly surprising, but I did not feel great after eating five Spoons lunches. As I waddled back to the office after my fish and chips on Friday, I was ready for a break from Spoons, dreading my fitness levels for Saturday morningaposs football match. Spoons service is hit and miss Over the week I found the service to be a mixed bag. Some staff were friendly but others were downright rude. The best were at the Berkely worst at the WG Grace.

Most ordinary Brits who are trying to improve their lestyle and lose weight wonapost have personal cooks and trainers to help them miraculously shed those pounds in a matter weeks like Love Island celebs and social media influencers. And not so long ago, cheap and convenient pre-made supermarket meals that could be popped in the microwave were more a busy personaposs guilty secret than something youaposd serve up to impress a date. Whataposs more, pre-made food of old - like the TV dinners from the frozen meals aisle at supermarkets everywhere - were probably not going to help a dieter pressed for time lose weight.    Anyone brave enough to take a closer look at the ingredients found those processed aposmystery mealsapos tended to contain scary levels of salt, sugar and additives. Today with trends like plant-based diets gaining popularity and meals able to be ordered to your door with a tap of an app - food producers have sat up and taken notice of the eating habits of todayaposs switched-on consumers. But while many of us increasingly like to know whataposs in our food and where it came from - we still want to get it for a decent price. Luckily for todayaposs shoppers - healthier pre-made alternatives are popping up everywhere. Reporter Anna Riley of Hull Live put the trend to the taste-test to see how a week eating only pre-made meals from LD Nutrition affected her health - and her waistline. Eating healthily can be tough  It takes time to pick out semi-decent looking fruit and veg during the weekly foodshop, meat and fish can be a bit on the pricey side, and letaposs face it, food shopping is pretty boring. So when I got the chance to try out some pre-prepared fresh meals from LD Nutrition made by former Hull City player Jamie Heard and his partner Michelle McIntyre - who are both personal trainers - I couldnapost turn down the offer. I was provided with  meals to last me a week, eating one for lunch and one for dinner. Each meal was essentially made up of a meat combined with a carb such as rice, noodles and pasta, with some added greenery such as veg or salad, and there was a lot of iety. Over the week I sampled chicken curry, meatballs with pasta, cold beef with salad, chicken with parmesan and salad, pulled pork with rice and vegetables and chicken with noodles and veg, amongst other meals, and I wasnapost disappointed. Hereaposs what I learnt during my time of eating pre-prepared meals. The food tasted great  As well as being so easy to eat, the food tasted great. The salad-type on the go meals were very fresh, despite being in the fridge for a couple of days, and the specials meals that could be frozen easily fitted in the freezer, and tasted just as good after being reheated My particular favourite was the chicken curry, and I also really liked the pasta with meatballs that I had. I was told by Michelle that the menu is always changing, which creates much-needed iety with the meals. She also said that the food they sell is prepared by a professional chef with nutritional input from herself and Jamie, so it is no wonder that the food tastes great. As the food is also freshly cooked on the day of pickup, there were no additional additives and preservatives in the meals, which can be added to other similar aposready mealapos styles of food. It made me feel good  As I was eating healthy food every day and also eating a decent breakfast of porridge, I felt a lot better in myself. My skin was clear, I had plenty of energy and it felt good that I was being so kind to my body by filling it with the vitamins and nutrition that it needed. My trousers certainly felt a little looser by the end of the week, and I felt likeI kept up the healthy eating regime I would be sure to lose more weight. After all, the key to any diet is consistency in healthy eating along with exercise. As the food was portion controlled, there was also no temptation to overeat, which can be the case when making a big meal for yourself, evenit is healthy. Sweet treats were even available  I shared some of the healthy snacks that LD Nutrition offer with my colleagues in the office, and we all found the sweet treats very pleasing. The doughnuts, protein balls, granola, brownie and muffin were all made without any sugar, and were no more than  calories each. A mixture of fruits, oats, coconut, oats, eggs and even sweet potato went into making the treats, and even though they didnapost taste exactly like your normal cake, they were a great healthy alternative to a snack. It was affordable  With each meal starting from as little as £, eating the pre-prepared meals was cheaper than buying supermarket lunch meal-deals and takeaways. By the time I would have bought all the ingredients for a weekly food shop, Iaposd also say that the cost of the meals that I had would be only slightly more than what I would be buying at the supermarket anyway, without having the hassle of cooking. The package that I had cost £ for  meals, which I thought was good value. The verdict at the end of the week   I really enjoyed not having to go food shopping for the week other than grabbing a few essentials like milk for my porridge on a morning and a tin of coffee and other such necessities. On top of this, it was great not having to cook any of the food that I hadnapost needed to shop for. Even better, I then didnapost have to wash up any pots for the food that I hadnapost shopped for or cooked, as I ate the meals straight out of the packaging that it came in, and then threw the containers straight into the bin without any fuss. I really enjoyed the experience of eating healthy pre-prepared meals that took no effort other than lting the lid of the container, or bunging the food in the microwave.

The -year-old had lesions on her feet for days after playing in the mud.Doctors at a primary care clinic in New England, US, diagnosed her with a parasitic infection caused by sand fleas that burrow themselves in the skin, the New England Journal of Medicine says.Her family told medics they had been on holiday in rural Brazil, during which the youngster walked through the pigsty with no shoes on. The infection is known as Tungiasis, caused by fleas native to Central and South America. It typically occurs in remote or poverty-hit areas, medics say.    The female sand flea burrows itself deep into the skin and suck the blood, causing the gruesome lesions to appear.They particularly affect the toes, soles and heels, the World Health Organisationsays.Lesions can become infected with bacteria, which leads to abscesses to form. Within about three weeks, the parasite dies and symptoms begin to regress, according to WHO.  Treatment generally consists of surgically extracting the burrowed sand fleas and then applying topical antibiotic. The WHO estimates around  million people are at risk of Tungiasis in the Americas.Science Magazine reports a researcher from Berlin let a sand flea grow inside her skin to find out whether the parasites mate before or after burrowing.And she found the parasites most likely have sex after females are already inside the host.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 12","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPIC:This beautul sunset across Loch Etive at Connel was taken with a mobile phone by Fiona McCuish from Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields need future plan","story":"NewsBob Shields: We need future plan for Ayr town centreRetail on our High Street is deadShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt least five years ago – and certainly a whole elected council ago – I wrote on this page that Ayr town centre would have to change . . . or die. So please, allow me to confess that I actually got this the wrong way round. What I should have said was - Ayr town centre is going to have to die . . . and then change. And for better or for worse, that’s exactly where we are today. Our retail sector’s passing away was slow and painful. The ‘For Sale’ signs on our shop fronts began as a malady that grew into an illness - and finally became a virulent pandemic that was completely out of anybody’s control. The boarding up of a whole section of the “bottom of the town” was a warning symptom that our town centre was seriously ill. By the time BHS brought down their shutters for the final time – we were on le support. And our financial heart finally stopped beating when the leviathan that was once Hourstons was declared deceased on February . A post mortem in last week’s Ayrshire Post showed a record  shops in Ayr now lie empty. And alongside the report, a quote from council leader Douglas Campbell that . . “we have to ensure that our town centres become much more erse and about more than just shops”. I couldn’t have put it better myself, Mr Campbell. In fact, it’s almost exactly how I did put it . . . five years ago! To be fair to Mr Campbell and his Nationalist cohorts, five years ago they were languishing in opposition to a bullying Tory regime. While Big Chief Sitting Bill McIntosh ruled the class of  with  Tory councillors and some Labour nodding donkeys – the nine elected Nats sat in the naughty corner with as much power as my electric cigarette charger. After the  elections, it was role reversal. Labour jumped ship to prop up the Nats and now it’s the Tories who sit powerless – with a self-inflicted lurch from hapless to helpless. And following decades of Tory droning and dithering, the Nats of  looked like they might actually deliver something. Two years into their administration, we’ve witnessed everything from diddyness to dizziness. After last year’s budget farce and the great “Riverside Carbuncle” – the council tax paying public were right to wonderthis mob could run a tap - never mind a local authority!

If not – the “unprecedented funding” of £ million they’re ploughing into this will be the greatest waste of money in SAC history.The elephant in the room, of course, is the “building next to the Ayr Station”.How SAC can have a “vision” for Ayr town centre – without first resolving this nightmare – doesn’t make sense.Just in case they hadn’t noticed, the big sandstone thing draped in white IS the centre of Ayr!

The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think tank of Ayr partisans - and they’ve delved into the past to come up with a future. A key plank is to rip-up the dated one-way system and construct a new inner ring road circling the historic centre. That involves re-using the old rail bridge across the River Ayr and incorporating Miller Road. Their new plan - called The Bruce - is in its infancy. The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre.The #ADB advocates the entire bottom end of the High Street no longer being a shopping area, and all businesses relocated towards the top of the town. Spokesman Pat Lorimer revealed: “We looked at what was special on the  map then we added in the favourite shops, bars, cafes and walking routes. “You could argue  was the heyday of Ayr.” Though the Bruce Plan will not be published for several weeks, we can reveal a new traffic plan is a priority to replace the present shambolic system that confuses visitors. The new inner ring road system would not involve Sandgate at all. Pat said: “The current system was developed piecemeal without a master plan, that is why it is so hopeless. “When visitors come to town by car they actually have no idea where they are within Ayr because of the confusing road.” Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure. The metal bridge was finally removed in , long after the single track rail had been pulled-up. The Bruce Plan is named after King Robert the Bruce who burned the English troops out of Ayr. The Ayrshire Post revealed last week there are  empty shops and buildings in the town centre area. The river end of the High Street would be completely given over to leisure and heritage. The council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. Retired architect Pat revealed the group were “trying to run with” and help South Ayrshire Council rather than be against them. That’s despite the view the council has a poor executive compared to the way East and North are run. However, unlike Ayr Renaissance - which had a £,-a-year chief executive -they won’t be funded by the council. Pat said: “There is a great future for Ayr and we need to find it. “We need action, not another consultant’s paid for report and more talk.“We are a pressure group of like-minded people who all want to help Ayr.” Already signed up as members are Ronald Alexander, Toria Cassidy, Michael G Clark, Rob Close, Kirsty Darwent, Michael Davis, Peter de Moncey-Conegliano, David Dickson, Allan Dorans, Chris Fremantle, Christine Fremantle, Lianne Hackett, Nigel Hackett, Ali Logan, Patrick Lorimer, Andy McAvoy, Ian McKinnell,Norman McLean, Angela McNay, Alistair Paterson, Gordon Smith and Fiona Walker.

The deal Clic Sargent struck to sell the land and buildings to McCarthy and Stone hinged on planning permission being granted and the Prestwick development going ahead. But, with last week’s bombshell news that McCarthy and Stone pulled the plug on the project, the charity is stuck with a £.m white elephant. Clic Sargent agreed to sell the buildings and land in  and struck a £.m agreement with McCarthy  Stone. But when the developers unveiled their luxury flat plans they became embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work had to stop. And last week the developers announced they had pulled the plug on the project. Now it has emerged the entire deal was conditional on planning permission being granted and the development going ahead. Kevin O’Brien from Clic Sargent said: “We are hugely disappointed that the sale hasn’t gone ahead as we’d hoped. “Every day that this building sits empty it not only impacts on the people of Prestwick. It means that we are not able to provide vital support for all the children with cancer in Scotland who desperately need us. “Selling Malcolm Sargent House was a really dficult decision because we are extremely proud of its history and the role it played in the local community.” He added: “We continue to seek a buyer so that we can use this money to pay for vital services like our social workers and Homes from Home, which provide an essential leline for families when they hear the devastating news that their child has cancer.” Prestwick councillor Hugh Hunter said: “We now have a site that’s going to lie empty and Clic Sargent have no idea what they are going to do with it. “They also have a £.m black hole in their books. “It’s been a shambles.” In  a petition to save Malcolm Sargent House received nearly , signatures in just a week.

Now Robert Dunlop has gained a criminal conviction for terrorising the people of Troon. The former Troon butcher, who turns  on April Fool’s Day, waged a letter vendetta against seven members of Troon Community Council. This reduced some community councillors to tears and one woman was so terried she now has a police panic alarm. Dunlop, of A Barassie Street, Troon, was found guilty on Friday by Sherf Scott Pattison of causing fear and alarm but not guilty of having a lock kne in Dundonald Road. His partner Krystyna Domanska, , was also on trial but was cleared of any involvement. Both had denied conducting the campaign between October  and September . Dunlop escaped with a slap on the wrist and has been warned to be of good behaviour for the next six months. His bail conditions banning him from approaching any of the community councillors will remain in place. This week a Troon Community Council spokesperson said: “We are very unhappy at the sentence but glad this man is now a convicted criminal. “He upset so many lovely volunteers in Troon and put us through the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. “It has been a very stressful time and we are all delighted this is now over.” Dozens of threatening letters were delivered to the home addresses of the community councillors. It was sparked when Dunlop lost the plot with the then South Ayrshire councillor Nan McFarlane, who had tried to help him in a benefits issue. The letters claimed the community councillors were involved in corruption, fraud and assault. Dunlop threatened to inform the public of this and claimed he was entitled to “bear arms and inflict violence”. The Ayrshire Post also received a nine-page letter, quoting an ancient Roman law called the Augustine Petition as the basis for the hostility. One y diatribe claimed all  South Ayrshire councillors were corrupt without providing any evidence. Other letters were despatched to South Ayrshire’s chief executive, legal head Ralph Riddiough, Troon police and the chief constable. Churches were also sent letters in a bid to blacken the names of citizens. Dunlop and Domanska made national headlines five years ago when the French village they were living in turned against them. They were accused of being neighbours from hell after building a wall, preventing the popular couple next door using their front door and nailing down their window shutters. The village mayor said the neighbours had been “terrorised” and Dunlop sent a -page letter to the French justice minister and an -page epic to then president Nicolas Sarkozy.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonScotlands CommunityAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thieving girvan florist ordered cough","story":"NewsThieving Girvan florist ordered to cough upLaurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February .ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsAnnabel Laurenson appeared at Ayr Sherf Court\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA thieving florist has made just one repayment on £ compensation ordered by a court, writes Edwin Lawrence. That was for £ - and was made over a year ago, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Yet social media pages during that time show Annabel Laurenson on days out all over south-west Scotland. They also show a new family car and pay-to-view sports channels in her family home. Laurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February . She admitted stealing from the Nicola Jayne Flowers business in Girvan on dates between January ,  and December , . Laurenson was ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work, and to pay back £ in compensation to her former bosses. The total value of cash and goods she stole was estimated at much more than this figure.    And the hurt and distress caused to her former employers, who were also her friends, can’t be quantied. Defence lawyer John Gallagher last week told Ayr Sherf Court that Laurenson, , had completed her unpaid work. But he admitted the only repayment she has made was the £ she turned up at court with - on the day of her sentence in February last year. Mr Gallagher claimed Laurenson, of Girvan’s Maxwell Street, had hoped to secure a loan from her father. But he died in November, and the costs of his care and his funeral made this impossible. “She is unemployed, but her husband is in work, and she is well aware this has to be repaid,” said Mr Gallagher. The lawyer said the remainder of Laurenson’s father’s estate would have to be shared with her mother and siblings. “How much is she likely to inherit ” asked Sherf John Montgomery. “I’m not sure,” said Mr Gallagher. “But not enough to pay this back.”    “The time for repayment has lapsed,” said Sherf Montgomery bluntly. Mr Gallagher insisted that Laurenson was anxious to pay the outstanding £. He asked the sherf to revoke the original payback order, and instruct a new compensation order. Mr Gallagher said Laurenson could pay £ per month, and Sherf Montgomery agreed to the request. Laurenson had worked at the popular Dalyrmple Street business for many years, and was a trusted member of staff. Shop owner Nicola Jayne Purdie said she was ‘devastated’ to find out her colleague and friend was ripping her off. She said at the time of last year’s sentence: “She stole a substantial amount of money and stock. There has been absolutely no remorse. She hasn’t said sorry. I feel betrayed. This is a family business and we were working together for  years.”Nicola Jayne said the theft came to light after she noticed discrepancies within the business. Laurenson who shared family occasions with the Purdies, including parties, weddings and funerals, offered no explanation for her behaviour.

Deloris is a Philadelphia lounge singer who dreams of stardom, but when she witnesses her lover-turned-gangster shoot one of his mob, she flees into the arms of good guy cop lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo .Delorisrsquo world is turned upside down when she is placed under witness protection in a rundown convent, disguised as nun Sister Mary Clarence.Although the adaptation does not feature songs from the original film, the musical repertoire is erse and magical.When we first catch a glimpse of the nuns, as they meander across the stage squawking like a bunch of demented penguins, I grimace. They are so out of tune I pray I donrsquot hear that god awful sound again.Upon learning that Deloris will be joining the convent, Mother Superior, played by Pam Graham, prays: ldquoDear Lordthis is a test, I cannot fail with you by my side. May she be of faith, of modestyhellip But she is stopped in her tracks by the voice of a brash American Deloris.Mother Superior continues: ldquoPerhaps the choir of angels drowned me out and you didnrsquot hear me Lord.Pam plays the exasperated Mother Superior prissy and clipped, with subtle comedy delivered in perfect tone.Of course things donrsquot run smoothly for the ghetto-fabulous a-turned-nun as you probably can imagine. It isnrsquot long before Deloris ruffles Mother Superiorrsquos habit and puts the nuns in danger, which leads to Deloris being given just one simple activity, joining the choir.Can she really unleash the songbirds trapped inside these nuns  This is when the show steps up a notch, and, although all dressed in habits, the audience can start to identy with the lead characters.In steps jolly Sister Mary Patrick, played by the enigmatic Claire Bell, along with Sister Mary Robertas the timid church mouse, and deadpan choir director Sister Mary Lazaruswho fully captured the gravelly voiced cantankerous nun. Her reprisal of the screen character is uncanny and garners lots of laughs from the audience.When the large ensemble of nuns gathered together, I did feel a sense of sisterhood and that they were each playing dferent characters despite having a minor role or no dialogue. Their pitch perfect delivery of lsquoRaise Your Voicersquo and lsquoTake Me To Heavenrsquo would draw the crowds into any church Irsquom sure.Playing the leading lady is no easy task, but in scene after scene Nicola embraces Deloris and puts her own sass and ghetto style into the character, belting out powerful tunes. To sum up her performance, what better words to use than those of Deloris Van Cartier herself ndash shersquos lsquoFabulous Babyrsquo!The last time I saw Lizzie Bell she was stumbling about drunk and shouting at a group of young kids, so I was shocked to see her convert to a Catholic nun. Of course, Lizzie was in character then as the vile orphanage boss Miss Hannigan, for Annie, performed by the Kids Innerleithen Theatre in November last year. The young actress shows true ersity, by portraying the meek Sister Mary Roberts with an enchanting solo performance.Although the female performances were powerful, they did not overshadow the male cast. Roger Brydon, Stewart Wilson and Colin Tweedie had me in tears as bumbling henchmen Joey, TJ and Pablo. Their comical performance of lsquoLady In The Long Black Dressrsquo didnrsquot leave females in the audience weak at the knees, but it did conjure up a few belly laughs!David Paterson was cast as Curtis who played the mob boss brilliantly, dominating the stage fiercely. And mild mannered officer Eddie Souterwho gave a cracking solo, proves he lsquoCould Be That Guyrsquo going from lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo to lsquoCool Copper, saving Deloris and winning her heart. A special mention to Jamie McCubbin, as the Irish Monsignor OrsquoHara ndashI closed my eyes Irsquod swear it was Father Ted!Needless to say the cast were at the top of their game, but anyone going to the show will no doubt be dazzled by the glitzy backdrop and detailed stained glass art of the fictional Catholic church.

This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-business-continuing-to-be-conducted-in-private","story":"Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeewas established by East Lothian Council last February after the British Horseracing Authority threatened to pull the coursersquos licence to race over concerns about its governance.Relations between members of predecessor body Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee were described as ldquofestering.It was made up of four East Lothian councillors and three members of Lothians Racing Syndicate , the latter representing racing interests.But the two factions were described in an independent report as having ldquoconsiderable mistrust, weariness, resentment and bitterness.Staff under the previous committee threatened to strike and there were claims of a lack of transparency surrounding their meetings and decisions.The independent report by Pinsent Mason was branded commercially sensitive by East Lothian Council, which refused to publish it until an investigation by the Information Commissioner led to a redacted version being made public.In February last year, the council replaced the old management committee with MRAC, giving the council a - majority over LRS.However, MRAC has held only four public meetings in council chambers in Haddington Town Hall since it was set up, with  of the  items of business on the agenda heard in private.On each occasion, the council has cited Local GovernmentAct , paragraph six, which allows it to exclude the public for ldquoinformation relating to the business affairs of particular persons other than the authority.East Lothian Council said that it ldquolooks to ensure that, as far as possible, committee matters are progressed in public.A spokesperson added: ldquoThe MRAC often considers matters in public session.ldquoAs with other committees, some reports may require to be held in private should they contain exempt information.Reports which have been withheld from the public include the current yearrsquos budget, financial reviews and racecourse general managerrsquos report.East Lothian Council is currently looking for a third-party operator to take over the running of the racecourse, which is on Common Good land.The hunt for a new operator is currently out to tender with hopes an appointment will be made before the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"prestonpans-shop-could-feature-on-bbc-show","story":"Corner Shop Cook Off is coming to screens across the country to show off the importance of local convenience stores in Scotland.The new show is presented by actress and musician Clare Grogan, with winner of MasterChef The Professionals Gary Maclean as the resident chef.Each week, a prominent Scottish chef will guest star, going head to head with Gary, only using ingredients from a selected local convenience store from around the country.The Day-Today on Redburn Road in Prestonpans has been selected as a possible store to feature on the show and,it is picked, the BBC portable kitchen will be set up in Prestonpans Town Hall for the event next month.The BBC said that it wanted the local shop owner and the customers to be the judges, adding: ldquoThis means we can really get into the heart of towns all over Scotland and show how essential the local convenience store really isIf confirmed, Corner Shop Cook Off will be filmed on April  and  in Prestonpans Town Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-as-prestonpans-charity-elcap-marks-its-30th-birthday","story":"The Lighthouse Hub hosted the event with a buffet, guest speakers and local musicians.Even microphone problems and a broken slideshow couldnrsquot dampen the mood as the birthday bash opened with two pipers from Preston Lodge High School Pipe Band.Bette Francis, member of the ELCAP board, hosted the event, introducing the speakers: chief executive Paul White, ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, and lastly a moving testimony from fellow board member Kirstin Doherty.Paul White, who was appointed chief executive five months ago, started the talks by outlining the importance that ELCAP played within communities, a point that was reiterated by guest speaker Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell.The final speaker, Kirstin Doherty, a member of the ELCAP board, has been supported by the charity since .

She called it Big Baby.She decided it was a girl and it became her favourite doll. It was soft and easy to cuddle, and Manja would take it with her everywhere.After years of being carried, played with and subjected to all manner of pampering with nail polish and make-up, the condition of the doll began to deteriorate.Then one day, Big Babyrsquos right leg came off! The seam holding the leg had torn and repeated repairs failed.At that time, I suggested we could replace her. But my daughter looked at me in horror: ldquoJust because she has one leg doesnrsquot mean I love her less.I remember being stung by my own insensitivity. Big Baby was not just an old doll, and I should have known that.Manja was six then. She is near  now. She has obviously grown in her games and play, yet Big Baby remains an important part of the family. But the loss of her dollrsquos leg led Manja into talking about disability. Over the years, it was a topic she wouldto when she was playing with her. She adapted clothes for Big Baby and refused to treat her as broken, or any less a doll.Then, recently, during one our story-making sessions together, she suddenly came up with this tale. We then wrote it down. I helped her with spelling and some phrases, but otherwise this is all her work and idea.I agree that children need to be taught empathy, but they often soon get it in ways adults forget, as I did. The discrimination and prejudice we encounter is taught by adults to children. Butwe listen to our children, they can often be the best teachers of understanding and empathy for us all.So here is Manjarsquos tale, which she titled The Magic Bracelet:Once there was an old man who had a foot which wouldnrsquot work and so he had dficulty walking.He had to use crutches and people said he was disabled, and because of this nobody would give him a job.So to get some money he would sit by the roadside and make porridge. Hersquod sell bowls of it to people who were walking by on their way to work. He told them that porridge was healthy and the best breakfast, which is true of course.So people would give him a penny for a bowl of his delicious porridge. That way he made some money.One day, while he was making his porridge, a young girl came and told him she would love to have a bowl of porridge but she had no money. The porridge maker gave the girl a kind smile.ldquoNever mind, he said, ldquoI always make extra just in case itrsquos needed.He handed her a bowl of porridge and she sat down and ate it. She was very hungry.As she gave the porridge-maker the bowl back, she noticed his crutches leaning against the wall.ldquoWhy do you have crutches  asked the girl.The porridge-maker looked sad and told her that he couldnrsquot walk very well because of his foot that wonrsquot work. He explained he needed his crutches to walk.The girl thought for a moment and smiled at the porridge-maker.ldquoI have a friend who can help you so you wonrsquot be disabled anymore, she said.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction. Who says personalities donrsquot matter in great historical events "},{"url":null,"title":"dennis-kelly-on-writing-matilda-the-musical","story":"ldquoFor a big musical, the show feels really theatrical, says Kelly, who wrote the show with composer and Edinburgh Festival Fringe favourite Tim Minchin. ldquoIt is polished, but it doesnrsquot always feel like it, which is great. To do the burp, we talked about loads of dferent ideas about how to do it and make it feel as though a burp had just happened, but in the end we went for something really simple, which works in big theatres, but which you could do in tiny spaces as well.The sort of spaces Kelly is talking about are exactly where the London-born writer began his play-writing career after joining a youth theatre while a teenager working in Sainsburyrsquos. His first play of note, Debris, was staged at the tiny Theatre , situated above a Battersea pub, in . He came to further prominence two years later when After The End was seen at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in a production directed by Roxana Silbert for the Paines Plough Company.By , Kellyrsquos BBC Three sit-com, Pulling, co-written with Sharon Horgan, was en route to being nominated for a BAFTA, while his  stage play, Orphans, premiered at the Traverse in a Birmingham Rep production directed by Silbert. The same year saw the National Theatre of Scotland premiere Kellyrsquos play for children, Our Teacherrsquos A Troll. With such a relatively left-field back catalogue, being approached by the Royal Shakespeare Company, then led by former director of Glasgowrsquos Tron Theatre, Michael Boyd, wasnrsquot what Kelly expected to happen next.ldquoWhen the RSC came to me and said they wanted me to do a musical, I said I didnrsquot have a clue about how to do that, Kelly remembers. ldquoI think they knew my work from Debris and Our Teacherrsquos A Troll, and I wrote about three drafts and then Matthew Warchus came on board as director. They looked around exhaustively for a composer, and as soon as I spoke to Matthew about Tim Minchin, I think he knew he was the one.Minchin is the Australian-based performer, whose internationally renowned musical comedy show, Darkside, was an Edinburgh hit in , winning him what was then the Perrier Comedy Award for best newcomer. By the time Kelly and Minchinrsquos take on the story opened in Stratford in , both had been through an extensive development process.ldquoWe did four of these huge two-week workshops, Kelly remembers, ldquoand it was a lot of work. I donrsquot really like workshops, to be honest. I find that stuff hard. The first person I want to hear doing something Irsquove written is the actor playing the part, but with something this big you just have to get on with it and do it.Kelly reckons the entire process took about four years.ldquoSomeone said to me at the time that was ten per cent of my le, he says.Matilda The Musical looks set to last a lot longer than that. Following its West End transfer, the show opened on Broadway, and went on to win seven Olivier Awards ndash the most ever won by a musical ndash and five Tony Awards. It has also toured Canada and Australia prior to its current UK tour. Has such international success changed things for Kelly ldquoIn some ways it changed things, he says, ldquoand in some ways it didnrsquot. Irsquove had a show on for the last eight years, which feels strange. As a playwright you tend to have a show on, then it closes and another one goes on, so it is dferent with Matilda, but after all this time I donrsquot have a lot to do with it anymore. I donrsquot think Irsquom a lot of use to it. I used to go in and maybe give a bit of advice, but at some point yoursquove got to step back and let them get on with it.ldquoHow I wanted to work didnrsquot change. Itrsquos not like this was what I was working towards, meeting famous people and swanning round musical theatre or anything like that. I still write grimy little plays, and always have done, and writing Matilda was no dferent from writing anything  Irsquove done.Such a down to earth approach is part of Matildarsquos appeal. ldquoThere are two things I really like about it, Kelly says. ldquoThe first is Matildarsquos inability to accept the status quo, and secondly, she doesnrsquot whinge about it. A lot of the time in musicals, people say, oh,only this or that happened, I could have done this. Matilda never really does that. She just gets on with it and sorts things out. I think as well itrsquos a bit cheeky and a bit naughty as a musical. The great thing about Roald Dahl is hersquos rude, and Irsquom rude as well, and so is Tim, so it all came together because wersquore all rude. But apart from anything , itrsquos amazing seeing that little girl telling the story, and holding , people or a couple of thousand people, in the palm of their hand.Kellyrsquos forte charting the adventures of unruly small people has continued with his version of Pinocchio, which he wrote for the National Theatre in London in a production that ran in  and  directed by John Tfany, formerly of the Traverse and National Theatre of Scotland. In this way, Kelly seems naturally drawn to such fictional trouble-makers.ldquoBeing able to watch someone who is very small overpower someone who is very big, thatrsquos not a bad message, he says. ldquoI learnt very early on, kids hate things that arenrsquot fair. If you tell a kid off and yoursquore wrong, they hate it. I just love the idea that therersquos a little girl out there who gets up and sorts things out.

And people need to compromise.AskedLabour was now willing to accept freedom of movement, she replied: ldquoWhat we are trying to do is trying to pull the House of Commons together and what we are trying to do that will get maximum support because we donrsquot accept Theresa Mayrsquos deal and we donrsquot want no-deal.Read more:Jacob Rees-Mogg denies supporting German far-right party after sharing leaderrsquos speechA Labour spokesman later added: \"In line with our policy, were supporting motions to keep options on the table to prevent a damaging Tory deal or no-deal, build consensus across the House to break the deadlock and deliver an outcome that can work for the whole country.\"SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said his party would also be backing the Boles motion, despite preferring the UK to remain in the EU.\"The key thing for us is that we stay in the European Union,\" Mr Blackford told the BBC. \"We want to revoke Article . We want to put it back to the people in a Peoples Vote.\"But we will be prepared to compromise on the basis of protecting jobs, staying in the single market and customs union, so we will vote for the Boles amendment.\"If all  SNP MPs fell in behind the plan tonight, it could win a majority unless seven to right or more Labour MPs rebelled against their partys whip.Last week, the closest option to gaining a majority among several others, all of which were rejected, was the one put forward by Ken Clarke, the former Conservative Chancellor, for a customs union. It was rejected by just eight votes.Mrs May has repeatedly dismissed the notion of a customs union as this would prevent Britain from having its own independent trade policy, something which she believes people voted for in the  EU referendum.The PM is hoping that, whatever materialises from tonightrsquos vote, it will focus the minds of those Conservative colleagues who have thus far failed to support her deal as ndash with no-deal off the table because Parliament would reject it ndash the choice, with just  days to the next scheduled exit day of April , will be between her deal and a long extension, which could produce a second referendum and the prospect of Britain staying in the EU.But ardent Brexiteer Steve Baker said this morning he could vote against the Tory Government in a Commons no-confidence vote.The former Brexit Minister told the BBCrsquos Politics Live that,Mrs May backed the UK staying in a customs union and Labour brought forward such a motion, he might vote against the Government. ldquoAt this point, I can foresee no circumstances while, as a Conservative MP, I voted against the Government in a confidence motion. But we are approaching the point where the stakes are now so very high and so transcend party politics and what this country is about and the fundamental British value that political power rests on consent, that these things are coming on to the table.Mrs May spent the weekend trying to build support among MPs who could be won over with aides saying she was \" per cent focused\" on getting the result she needed.She is also hoping to win over some Labour MPs with the promise, made during Fridayrsquos debate, to accept a proposal made by six of them that Westminster should to have a greater influence in the future negotiations process with the EU.But the Democratic Unionists remain staunchly opposed to the PMrsquos plan, believing it would undermine the integrity of the Union. Sammy Wilson, its Brexit spokesman, insisted the UK-EU deal would \"take us away from the country that we fought to stay part of\".At the weekend, David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, warned the PM not to ignore the will of Parliamentit did swing behind a \"softer\" Brexit.In an interview with the BBC, Julian Smith, the Government Chief Whip, took the unusual step of breaking his silence to argue that the parliamentary arithmetic meant a \"softer type of Brexit\" was inevitable.He also berated his Cabinet colleagues, saying their isions had produced the ldquoworst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history.This morning, Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, pointed out that the will of Parliament so far had not been in favour of a customs union but added: ldquoThe answer lies in modications to the Prime Ministers deal to be able to get that to have support. She did not elaborate what the modications were.No  sources confirmed that, once again, Cabinet ministers would be told to abstain on the indicative votes while Conservative MPs would have a free vote.The options on offer not only include a customs agreement with the EU but also a second referendum on any deal, a Norway-style ldquocommon market . deal and a power for MPs to vote to block a no-deal Brexit as well as scrapping withdrawal altogether.Before any debate can take place, MPs will vote on a business motion so that the indicative votes process can proceed. Downing Street sources confirmed the Government would again whip against the motion as it believes Parliament taking over the Commons agenda risks creating a harmful constitutional precedent.Meanwhile, in an open letter to MPs, the Chief Executive of Siemens UK urged them to unite around a \"customs union compromise,\" which he said was \"essential\" to frictionless trade and would save companies billions each year.Juergen Maier warned that the UK used to be a \"beacon for stability\" but was now becoming a \"laughing stock\".His comments came after Michael Roth, the German Deputy Foreign Minister, lashed out at Brexit.\"Brexit is a big sh**show, I say that now very undiplomatically,\" declared Mr Roth.He told a Social Democratic Party event in Berlin that \" per cent\" of the UK Cabinet had \"no idea how workers think, live, work and behave\".Politicians, he argued, \"born with silver spoons in their mouths, who went to private schools and elite universities\" would not be the ones to suffer the consequences of Brexit.Responding to his comments, Mrs Mays spokesman said: \"He answered his own question with the undiplomatic comment. It is important that we get on with delivering on the verdict of the referendum for the British people. Thats what the Prime Minister is focused on.\"Speaking in Germany, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, said it was time for MPs to make clear what they wanted.\"A sphinx is an open book in direct comparison with the British Parliament.

Four-fths of Scotlandrsquos peatlands are now listedas damaged.An army of expert contractors and volunteers from East Ayrshire Coalfield Environment Initiativecreated or repaired the  hectares of peatland, including  within the Muirkirk Uplands Site of Special Scientic Interest.CEI manager Daisy Whytock said: ldquoPeatlands make up one-fth of the land cover in East Ayrshire, and much of this area has been degraded in some way.ldquoThe peatland restoration work carried out by the CEI, its partners and local land owners has the potential to benefit bioersity, the environment and local people.The work at Muirkirk was carriedout over winter with the help of Sorn Estates, which will farm the moors.Between December  and February , specialist peatland restoration contractors installed more than , dams and water-retaining bunds across a dense network of old ditches to re-wet the degraded peatland.Peat-forming Sphagnum mosses and bog plants can now grow in the blocked ditches and will slowly seal them with new peat.This work will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve local water quality and protect habitat for rare species such as hen harriers, curlew and Large Heath butterflies.A healthy bog acts like a sponge, capturing rainwater during storms and slowly releasing the filtered water into local river catchments throughoutthe year.On drained peatlands rain water pours into ditches and watercourses carrying eroded dry peat. This contaminates water courses and increases the risk of flooding. By blocking drainage ditches, local rivers and communities will benefit from improved water quality.These special wetlands are home to many rare plants and animals that are specially adapted to the soggy conditions. Draining the bog makes it harder for these wet-loving species to survive and prevents the formation of new peat.Peat is formed from partially-decomposed plant material that accumulates in the wet, acidic conditions. As they grow, peatland plants trap carbon from the atmosphere that is then stored as peat below the bogrsquos living surface.Drained peatlands release vast amounts of carbon back into the atmosphere. It is estimated degraded peatlands contribute . per cent of global, man-made CO emissions. The peat soils at Sorn Estate are more than ft  metres deep in some places and the work carried out by CEI will help keep the peat locked away. A wet surface covered in bog mosses will also capture more carbon from the atmosphere, helping to combat climate change.More than % of Scotlandrsquos land area is covered in peaty soils. Largeareas have been damaged over centuries, with extensive damage to the core peat reserves and its specialised vegetation.Scottish Natural Heritagersquos Peatland Action said Scotland losing the carbon stored in our peat soils would be the equivalent of more than  times Scotlandrsquos annual greenhouse gas emissions.

That has been done where to allow new stations to be opened as soon as they are ready on completion of construction work.\"Its then up to Transport Scotland, Network Rail and the contractors to get the station finished as quickly as they can, so it can open as soon as possible, albeit after December  but before May .\"It is believed that since Cllr Ford asked that Kintore station still be included in the December  timetable, Aberdeenshire Council transportation officers have made a similar request.\"We need Kintore station open and available for residents to use at the earliest possible date,\" said Cllr Ford.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gordon MP Colin Clark with Allyn Harper and Bryan Harper\"  MP visits Insch firm viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"kellands pupils show off work at art gallery","story":"Pupils at Kellands School proudly displayed their artwork at a special gallery in Inverurie recently.The Kellands Community Art Gallery was held at the Town Hall on Thursday, March .PD and PCH had their work on display that was inspired by maths and the video game FortniteTeam P had been working very hard throughout the last term to organise the event.It was open to family, friends and members of the public.Before the event they had created invitations and VIP letters, tickets, posters and an event programme.The gallery featured pieces of art work by all classes in the school including LGU’s print art pieces, PM’s self-portraits, PW’s collages and PC’s sunset and sunrise pictures of Bennachie.PG created their own McCoo picturesThe school would like to thank Pamela Miller, Gabby Reith Thompson, the P parent helpers, and all those who took the time to come down to the gallery.They also wish to thank Tesco for donating the refreshments served at the event.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Fraserburgh South Park were crowned the winners\"  Pupils impress at J Rock viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"pupils impress at j rock","story":"Fraserburgh South Park Primary School were named the winners with their performance Trick or Treat  Up Witches Street.St Andrews were second with their performanceThey were followed by Fraserburghs St Andrews Primary School in second with Mother Natures Dream.Meanwhile Strichen School were third with Titanic and Stuartfield and Fetterangus Primary School came fourth with Apollo .Banffshire and Buchan Coast MSP Stewart Stevenson, first place prize presenter, said: \"The J Rock is a really wonderful event for so many local schools, everyone who comes here enjoys themselves.

Nothing yesterday was supported by the House. The deal is the best thing for agriculture, the best thing for the future, and the best thing for a long-term relationship between ourselves and the European Union.Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “For Brexiteers to talk about the post-Brexit agriculture industry being of #paramount importance# while cheerfully voting for a #no deal# Brexit that could destroy it, smacks of hypocrisy. Our farmers and crofters need to realise that those who promote #no-deal# Brexit are not on their side. They are prepared to damage the livelihoods of our livestock farmers and crofters to pursue their Brexit unicorns.“The test for any deal the government comes back with for our rural communities, must be whether it allows them to continue to access key European export markets.

Waste cooking oil, lubricant oil and garden waste would need to be taken to  Bossack.Businesses wishing to do this should note they would need to register as a waste carrier with SEPA . There is currently no charge for this for many businesses.It’s also important businesses understand they need to register with the council ahead of taking waste or recycling to Bossack or Chinglebraes, to avoid delays at the gate — or possibly being turned away.Businesses can set up a trade waste and or recycling collection service with the council.Darren Richardson is the council’s head of infrastructure services. He said: “We’re issuing these reminders now to help businesses avoid falling foul of SEPA and possibly incurring fines.“Equally, we’re keen to spread the word amongst businesses that recycling where possible is not only a legal requirement, but it can also save them money.“It’s far cheaper to separate out recyclates than it is to dispose of these items in general waste. It also contributes to the Zero Waste Plan for Scotland where targets proposed include recycling  per cent of all Scotland’s waste and only  per cent of remaining waste ending up in landfill by .“The situation is slightly dferent on the isles with regards to recycling — so we are writing separately to isles businesses.“We’re here to help all businesses and we’d encourage any local business, no matter the size, to contact usthey’re unsure about what they need to do or wish to establish a recycling or waste collection service with us.”Resources and information for businesses is regularly updated on the council’s website and any business, large or small, who is unsure of whether their waste and or recycling is classed as commercial waste should get in touch with the council’s Waste Team on .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The subsidy is unlawful state aid and it will disturb the market.”The company decided to go to Scotland’s highest civil court after an announcement from the Scottish Government last month. The ministers had decided to name three companies who are bidding to provide ferry services between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland.Final tenders for the contract are expected to be submitted by the end of April  and the successful firm will receive a subsidy estimated to be worth around £ million.Legal papers lodged in the case show that Pentland Ferries seeks a declarator from the court that the proposed subsidy is unlawful and breaches obligations placed upon the government by EU law.Today saw lawyers for the Scottish government argued that the ministers had acted lawfully.Having finished hearing from both sides, Lord Boyd said he’d issue his decision at some point in the near future.See next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian for the full story.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The last helicopter is just about to leave from the Parliament roof as Jeremy Corbyn and the Viet Cong approach the gates – make sure the Scottish MPs are on the last flight out of Dodge.

The clarion has been called, all roads now point to independence as the only show in town.There’s no doubt the Brexit omnishambles is pushing folk towards “freedom” with Indyref coming to a cinema near you shortly. Theresa May has started talking backwards like something out of Twin Peaks and everyone who doesn’t work as a political journalist has given up on trying to make sense out of the whole sorry saga.Polls and stuff on Facebook say that two thirds of Scots who are “undecided” about independence, believe Brexit makes it likely and more than half would now opt for the Tunnock’s Caramel WafersBritain leaves the EU without a deal. : Kevan Christie: What Plato had to say about BrexitThe time has come to tell the Eton Rles where to go – Rees-Moog, Dominic Saab, Boris and the like can do one. Not Amber Rudd though, she seems nice. Arlene Foster can get back to watching ‘ Great Orange Walks’ on her Betamax video recorder as her beloved Union shrinks before her eyes.

The Battles of Trafalgar in  and Waterloo in  were obvious highlights as was the winning of two World Wars and one World Cup – - at Wembley in , but we Scots need to move on.Hopefully we’ll still have trade agreements with the English when independence inevitably comes, so there’ll be no need to stock up on essential items like HP Sauce and Colman’s Mustard.All Nicolahas to do pre-Indyref is issue a decree that no-one in the SNP says or does anything daft – big ask, I know – and we should be home and hosed provided the Section  order hurdle can be overcome and a mandate to hold a second referendum secured.

Here’s hoping – fingers crossed.: Kevan Christie: Red Clydesiders would despair over Edinburgh-Glasgow rivalryIt will be painful but we need the Scottish Government to tell the truth – no more of this “Harry Potter and the White Paper on Scotland’s Future” nonsense.

With schisms in both the Tory and Labour parties, there is no end in sight to the misery, no matterNoel Edmonds finally gets his Brexit Deal or No Deal passed in the House. The whole thing has been a disaster from beginning to end and it’s no surprise that more people are toying with the idea of voting for independence when it inevitably comes around again.I feel there is a season of goodwill towards Scotland in the European Union. The likes of Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier know we are not supporters of this Brexit bampottery and voted for no such thing. Not in my name. Perhaps, they’ll let us join the EUwe go independent or at least let us stay pals via the EEA or EFTA routes.If Indyref does come about, let’s make it swt and above all be nice to each other. The opportunity for Scotland to be a cool wee Tommy Robinson-free country is within reach, but we cannot allow the SNP to dominate. Knowing the names of train stations in Gaelic is not on the list of everyone’s priorities but there’s no need to tell the poileas. Maybe they’ll finally be held to account in an independent Scotland and we can get on with fixing health and education. Those who are in the process of travelling from No to Yes via the Brexit disaster have to be made to feel included – an independent Scotland cannot be just for the SNP and their members. Wandering Labour supporters who can’t quite bring themselves to vote for the Nationalists need a home and  sharing with the Tories to support a busted flush union is no longer an option.So, thanks for the fun-filled -odd years but I’m afraid the last couple have been deal breakers.

However, Article  of the EEA agreement provides members with an “emergency brake” to suspend rules such as free movement in case of “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties”. : Fears of ‘blind Brexit’ after series of votesNationalists worried the brake could be used by Westminster without consulting Edinburgh.

The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues. However, some items such as these documents are too fragile to be on long-term display, so putting them online is a great way to showcase them.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #.The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth.The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society.Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed.

You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi. Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth. I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time.However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on.Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want.

Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting.Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners.At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go.How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy.Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust.Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn.Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn.Can’t these lads raise their game  Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracy .Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee: The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers.

She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2447-Nairn-v-LHWFC-adj-credit-euan-macleod.jpg","title":"lewis and harris womens football team kick off new league in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine with a barnstorming - away win over Nairn Ladies FC.The long trip to Nairn for their league opener on Saturday proved to be one to remember for the islanders as they enjoyed a resounding victory to get their league campaign up and running in emphatic fashion.Played in freezing conditions on Nairn showfield, the Lewis and Harris club fielded a young side made up largely of - and -year-olds # with just three non-pupil players included in the squad.After missing a penalty, Ann-Mairi Macleod made history by becoming the scorer of the first goal in the newly-formed Highlands and Islands league.Macleod#s goal opened the floodgates as the visitors went on to score five more in the first period # thanks to a goal apiece from Jessica Macleod and Hollie Martin, and a hat-trick from Mary Macleod.Lewis and Harris were in dreamland in the second half as they proceeded to score a further  goals.

They need tangible changes now, not months down the line.“Teachers are entitled to a safe working environment in which their wellbeing is safeguarded. Their Employer has a legal duty of care for them, which at the moment it is failing to deliver.“We hope that the Employer will agree to engage meaningfully with the union to address members’ concerns fully so that further strike action can be avoided.”The school will remain open this week despite the strike action.The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools called on the NASUWT to continue to engage in attempts to resolve the dispute and said the outstanding issues would not be resolved through strike action."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one of our most unique and historic resting places","story":"There are no signs directing visitors to Tullyrusk graveyard which sits in the expanse of fields beyond the Ballymac Hotel. And there isn’t even a road to it. This graveyard is a precious relic of old Ireland that has been forgotten by all except those whose relatives lie there.Dúlra only learned about it from a reader who had happened upon the cemetery while out for a walk. The reader had mentioned that there were yew trees in the graveyard, and it was those trees that finally caught Dúlra’s eye or he wouldn’t have found it at all.And so he walked through a farmer’s gate towards a circular mound in the distance that is raised above the surrounding rolling fields that sweep down towards Lough Neagh, up the stone steps and in through the double iron gates. And what Dúlra found was a beautul, remote, wild resting place with stunning views over much of Ulster.It’s a graveyard from the mists of time. In ancient days it was a church whose name has long been forgotten which was reputedly founded by St Patrick. A thousand years later it was demolished by Cromwell. The foundations of the church are still visible, along with a holy well nearby.Indeed, the church at Tullyrusk was so famous it got got name-checked in story written in Armagh way back in the s.The gravestones reveal a mixed clientele – Catholics and Protestants made equal by the Great Leveller. Simply known today after the townland Tulaigh Ruisc, the hillock of the march, the oldest legible gravestone inscription dates from  . The most recent, as Dúlra was soon to discover, was last Friday on the day of his visit, a poignant reminder that in Ireland, history and the present day are rarely separated.A century ago cultural activist Francis Joseph Bigger called Tullyrusk the “last of the old burial places left to the ancient stock”, and said that a hundred years previously, the old Irish keening would wail around the crumbling walls during funerals. Some say it can still be heard in the wind after the burial of the old clans, he wrote.But the grave of one heroic resident of Tullyrusk remains unmarked. A local man called Armstrong was condemned to hang in Lisburn in  after messages from the United Irishmen were found sewn into the lining of his waistcoat. As he awaited the gallows, his we and children were allowed to see him, begging him to save his le by turning in his comrades.“Do not tempt me, mo chroí,” he told her. “My le is only one, and God will watch over my widow and children.” If I inform, he said, many “wives would be made widows and hundreds of children left fatherless”.As Dúlra walked through the small graveyard, its ground uneven due to the multiple burials over centuries, he thought of the distraught widow burying her husband that summer’s day in , her children gathered around her. There could have been few sadder sights in the tragic history of this land.Dúlra was making his way around the old gravestones, doing his best to decipher them, when a gravedigger arrived. “This graveyard is rarely used for funerals nowadays,” he said. “I’m called here once a year at the most.”Dúlra left before the funeral cortege arrived – access is through a nearby bungalow and the coffin is usually carried across the fields amid the glorious backdrop as has been done for countless centuries.Dúlra could not think of a better place to lie, below the beautul yew trees in one of the country#s most unique and historic resting places.A place apart, overlooking Lough Neagh and beyond, and alongside countless generations of a proud people. * If you’ve seen or photographed anything interesting, or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"dup shuns brexit alternatives to mays proposal during another day of stalemate","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

An operations trailer equipped with computers and a mapping suite has been set up in a car park area beside the disused airfield.A buggy will also allow officers to access marshy ground behind the caravan park.Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation into Lisas disappearance in , said a number of other areas will be searched in the coming days.\"The determination of the PSNI to bring those who killed Lisa Dorrian to justice is as strong today as it has ever been,\" he said. \"The purpose of the search operation is two-fold: firstly, I want to recover Lisas body and allow the Dorrian family to finally put Lisa to rest. \"And, secondly, I am looking for evidence relating to her disappearance.\"The senior officer described the relationship between police and Lisas family as very positive and confirmed that they were notied in advance of the planned search and have been updated on the current position of the investigation.Police believe Lisa was secretly buried by two men known to each other, only one of whom was known to Lisa. Earlier this year DS Murphy revealed that he believes the killer and his accomplice share a close \"bond\" which is why they have not given each other up. \"I firmly believe that the answers to Lisas disappearance lie with a small number of people,\" he said. \"They may believe that they are bound by a common bond and have maintained their silence as a result. That silence will be a heavy and lelong burden. We can help to unlock that burden, but we cannot do so whilst they remain silent.\"One theory is that the killer summoned his father to help transport Lisas body in a car before she was buried near the spot where she vanished. Security sources do not believe the murder was premeditated, meaning that her disappearance was rushed. However, the initial police investigation focused on a group of criminals who Lisa owed money to, allowing the real killer and his accomplice time to cover their tracks and remove DNA traces. The last person to see Lisa alive in February  was Mark Lovett, then  years old.He told police that he and Lisa fled the caravan where they were partying after hearing noises and seeing flashing lights outside. No one has been charged with the -year-olds murder.Police have pursued more than , lines of enquiry and carried out almost  searches.Extensive air, water and land searches around Ballyhalbert, including the use of underwater search teams, failed to yield results in . A  search of land owned by Jimmy Seales in Comber - who was convicted of an unrelated killing - also proved futile despite information that a vehicle used in Lisas disappearance had ended up in landfill there.A  search for the missing shop worker focused on another area of farmland just outside Comber.

Full UK-wide participation in the customs union and single market is acceptable to the DUP because it does not leave Northern Ireland aligned to the EU in isolation.It would maintain a soft border, debunking the persistent myth that the DUP wants a hard border.On Wednesday, the DUP opposed harder Brexit options - such as customs union membership alone - because it would not remove the backstop on which the May-EU withdrawal agreement rests.The DUP also rejected Labours fantasy option of membership of a customs union - asthere is an a la carte menu of such unions - in which the UK would miraculously continue to have the right to its own global trade deals and input to those of the EU.Belatedly, the dferences between the European Research Group - obsessed with Brexit - and the DUP - preoccupied only with Northern Irelands equal Brexit alongside the rest of the UK - have begun to be laid bare. Boris bin, ditch and junk the backstop Johnson wont be getting a repeat slot at the next DUP conference.Having used the event to launch his Conservative Party ascendancy, any fidelity to the DUP dissolved the moment Theresa May said \"support my backstop deal and theres a leadership vacancy\".Shameless is too inadequate a word.Et tu, Jacob Ill only changethe DUP moves Rees-Mogg, you changed as the DUP held steadfast. The DUP conference gig could have been yours, Jacob. I was looking forward to the first such gathering to be addressed in Latin.Many continue to criticise the DUP. The extensive support for the backstop across Northern Irelands business and farming communities shows a determination that economic logic ought to trump constitutional politics. Seamless access to EU and UK single markets matters, protecting livelihoods.To those at risk, this matters more than unproven claims that Northern Irelands unique alignment to the EU single market would be a constitutional betrayal, jeopardising the Union.In trying to persuade the DUP onside, the UK Government has made clear that it will not allow regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In other words,EU single market regulations change, the Government will adopt them across the UK to protect Northern Irelands EU and UK trading relationships.The problem is that the DUP will not trust successor governments to honour that pledge.A certain mythology has developed over the seamlessness of Northern Irelands place in the UK single market.A reader, Alan Brookes, contacted me wondering how many people recalled that some British people from where in the UK could not work in Northern Ireland from  until  without a work permit.Such permitswere issued only to qualied essential workers, with notable exceptions such as members of the Armed Forces, religious ministers and teachers.Under the old Stormont regime, the Safeguard of Employment Act was designed to create local jobs for local workers. Brookes recalls his final interview with a Northern Ireland engineering firm in . \"When they asked did I need a work permit as I was born in England and I stated I did they immediately cooled and I was informed it would be too dficult\".There have long been checks on certain commodities travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and identication is always required.None of this has threatened the Union, but it has highlighted the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland.If the backstop worked well, it might possibly stem the rising demands of nationalists for constitutional change via a border poll and shore up the Union. After all, Northern Ireland only looks vaguely secure when it is economically prosperous and politically ing.Rarely, in other words.The DUPs intransigence has been matched by the EU steadfastly refusing to change a single word of the withdrawal agreement.There might be something faintly ridiculous about the chancelleries of Europe standing paralysed before Sammy Wilson, Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, but its where we are.The DUP will never back the backstop in its current form. Amid all the noise, the party has at least been consistent, wanting a deal, but clear that no backstop removal equals no deal.What more can Theresa May do to sell her agreement given she has laid down her political le for the bargain  Rename it St Andrews perhaps The withdrawal agreement is as unsellable to the DUP as it is unchangeable for the EU. Mays promise to stand downher deal passes could be the longest resignation note in history. It is utterly irrelevant to the DUP. And the DUP do not fear a general election.Charting a way forward,the DUP does believe that UK-wide customs union and single market alignment to the EU solves the backstop conundrum, why not vote for it, rather than abstain,another opportunity arises For the DUP, its all about UKexit, not Brexit.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of books on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed alevel league table for northern ireland catholic schools dominate top positions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

DUP MPs Ian Paisley, Emma Little Pengelly and David Simpson were the only members of the party not to take part in the subsequent vote on the matter. MP Jim Shannon took part in the debate. He raised concern about the \"right of parents\" to withdraw children from the lessons saying he had received \"considerable correspondence\" on the issue.\"The Government’s proposed changes will put parents and teachers in an impossible situation,\" he told the Commons. \"In some cases, I suspect that it will put them on a collision course. Teachers are being told that they must teach relationships and sex education in an integrated way and that,necessary, they should be able to remove young people from some parts of their lessons, but not others.\"As I see it, the Government could address the problem by amending the regulations, either to mandate that sex education and relationship education be taught as two separate subjects or to ensure that the right of withdrawal continues to cover both sex education and relationships education. \"The latter decision seems to me more sensible and would be very easy to make.\" The DUP has been approached for a comment."},{"url":null,"title":"watch men carry three wellbehaved falcons onto flight to dubai","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is vital our leisure services are made welcoming for our entire community.Council chairman Mark Murnin welcomed the move and said he was delighted that families with children with autism could enjoy the same facilities as families in Newry.Committee chairman Cllr Gareth Sharvin said he had raised the matter with the February meeting.The move was also welcomed by Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.The news has been welcomed by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group which has been working with the council on the proposal.Group chair Aacuteine Sloan welcomed the move, saying ldquoit will now make this first class facility accessible to all.She added: ldquoIt will give local autism families the opportunity to use the pool and feel more relaxed alongside other families that understand the struggles that may arise. I hope this is something that continues after the trail period.ldquoWe are also hopeful that the council will source fully qualied special needs swimming instructors soon too so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan business gains contract with leading aircraft firm  ","story":"AIRCRAFT manufacturer Dornier Seawings has contracted Ballygowan precision engineering company McGreevy Engineering to machine parts for its iconic Seastar amphibious aircraft,.Dornier rose to prominence in the s and s as a manufacturer of large, all metal flying boats.The Seastar, designed in Germany, is engineered to operate from runway and water surfaces allowing for short field take-off and landing capabilities.Representatives from the local company met initially with Dornier Seawings at the Farnborough Airshow last July and subsequently gained a number of contracts.The Ballygowan firmrsquos managing director, Aaron McGreevy, said it was very pleased to be working with Dornier Seawings, a multicultural and multi-national joint venture between the Dornier family and two fully state-owned Chinese enterprises.ldquoGiven our recent investment to ersy our capabilities this is great news indeed, said Mr McGreevy.ldquoThe Dornier brand has a heritage of a pioneering spirit.

A Rhys OrsquoDonnell box kick was marginally long and carried back with interest before quick hands from Crosbie put his winger in for a superb try.The conversion left the game in the balance at -.The home side continued to dominate possession and territory and a Reaney penalty following a great breakdown turnover from skipper Aaron Cairns gave them a little breathing space.Old Belvedere, despite showing admirable invention, were guilty on occasion of overplaying and a series of errors meant they were pinned back in their own half.The bonus point score went to Cronin who drove over the line when Adair was held up just short and with  minutes to go Hinch looked certain of victory at -.A superb defensive effort then kept their Dublin opponents at bay in relative comfort until the th minute when the pressure eventually led to an overlap to leave the away side in with a chance of a draw as the game reached its final moments.However, in their desperation to run the ball out of defence and keep the game alive, Old Belvedere conceded a penalty which Reaney knocked over to clinch the win.That should have been the end of proceedings, but a penalty from a scrum led to another Belvo charge and they were awarded another penalty which Crosbie slotted with the last kick of the game to take two points back to Dublin.Ballynahinch continue their winning run and stand level with Old Wesley at the top of the table with two games to go.Ballynahinch Old Belvedere AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Best friends laid to rest after accident  ","story":"BEST friends Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson were buried side by side on Saturday.The two men in their twenties died together in a car crash on the Carlingford to Omeath Road in the early hours of Monday, March .It is believed they died at the scene and that no other vehicle was involved.Mr McAnallen was from the Castlewellan area and Mr Patterson was from Bryansford.Their tragic deaths, and that of missing Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire who also died in Carlingford over the St Patrickrsquos holiday weekend, left the community numb with grief.A community candlelight vigil was held in Carlingford on Sunday night which was attended by representatives from the deceasedrsquos families and rescue and emergency services.All three were connected to Bryansford GAC mdash the young men were former under-age players while mother of three Ms Maguire was the clubrsquos under-age coach.Mr Patterson also played for a time with Ballynahinch RFC U-s.He and Ms Maguire were also connected to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Newcastle.Ms Maguirersquos children attend the school and she was active in the St Maryrsquos Parent Support Group while Mr Patterson was a fondly remembered past pupil of the school.Ms Maguire was also known through her work as a casual leisure attendant at Newcastle Centre and also as a nursing assistant at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.The  year-old had been reported missing from a group of friends on a hen night while there were out socialising in Carlingford on Saturday.An extensive land and sea search was carried out on Sunday.On Monday, her body was recovered from the lough around the same time as the deaths of the young men became public.Mr McAnallen and Mr Patterson, also known as Marty Patt to friends, were laid to rest in separate ceremonies with many local people attending both services.A funeral for Mr McAnallen was held in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan early on Saturday morning.

across-the-board political support from his Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues to provide funding to the service which plays a critical role across the district.It has been revealed that between August  and November last year, the air ambulance responded to  incidents across the council area.ldquoThe air ambulance is vital for people across the district, given its rural nature and attractions like the Mournes and Strangford Lough, Cllr Walke rsaid.The Rowallane politician recently visited the air ambulancersquos base outside Lisburn where he was joined by two of his party colleagues from Mid Ulster and Derry and Strabane Councils, both of which have agreed to provide financial support for the lesaving service.With three local authorities already on board, Cllr Walker hopes that the remaining eight Northern Ireland councils will provide financial support.He said while Stormont funds the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment, it should be picking up the remainder of the servicersquos running costs.He confirmed that Strangford MP Jim Shannon plans to raise this issue with Department of Health Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly.ldquoDown District is already a main user of the air ambulance service which has already helped save a number of lives, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoThe service relies heavily upon donations to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs and while this is welcome, I believe local councils and indeed the Department of Health needs to do more.Cllr Walker says while the air ambulance relies heavily upon public support, it also needs a sustainable funding stream to ensure it can continue to save lives and hopes this will be provided by the Department of Health.ldquoThe service is a key component of the emergency services and should not have to rely on charitable donations, he continued.ldquoGiven the costs to keep the service in the air, I believe all of the Provincersquos

the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough is seeking a meeting with local politicians.The Lecale Lightkeepers want to meet face-to-face with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors to spell out why the beam must be retained and why the proposed LED replacement suggested by the Dublin-based Commissioner of Irish Lights is totally inadequate and unacceptable.Campaigners have also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the local authority for copies of all correspondence between the councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Department and the Commissionerrsquos office on the lighthouse issue.Last month, the local authority was heavily criticised for excluding the press and public from a meeting mdash billed as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe.The council subsequently confirmed the workshop, held at the local authorityrsquos headquarters in Downpatrick, was a ldquopreliminary information session for councillors and that prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for the future of the lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation would take place.The workshop lasted well over one hour but the report from the behind-closed-doors session which has been sent to councillors amounts to a paltry two and a half lines.Signicantly, the paper does not detail the questions put by councillors or, most importantly the response from Commissioner officials, compounding the frustration of those seeking to retain the beam.They are angry that the council report provides no detail whatsoever of what was discussed and simply states the issue of the lighthouse beam will be raised at district electoral forums across the district.Campaigners insist that as the Commissioner of Irish Lights had the opportunity to put its case before councillors, it is only right and proper and in keeping with equality legislation and good old fashioned fairness, that the Lecale Lightkeepers should be afforded the same opportunity.The campaigners have been exchanging correspondence with council officials and described one response confirming the sweeping beam issue will be discussed at ious district electoral forums with a view to having a joint meeting with Captain McCabe, which the public could also attend, as ldquodismissive and derogatory.The Lecale Lightkeepers have also vehemently rejected the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be the ldquomost appropriate forum to address the issues they have raised.A spokesperson for the campaign group said councillors were keen to protect the iconic, sweeping beam, describing plans to remove the mercury bearing which rotates the Fresnel lamp due to health concerns as ldquoflimsy and flawed.They have also rejected claims that a new LED light proposed by the Commissioners would be the same, arguing this ldquosimply isnrsquot true.Campaigners say it is their understanding that some councillors are at a complete loss as to why the local authority is denying them a chance to meet all of the councilrsquos  members to state their case.They say Commissioners were in Downpatrick last month because councillors voted unanimously to invite them for a meeting to discuss the controversial plan to replace the sweeping beam with what, in their view, is a much inferior light.ldquoThe irony of what is happening is not lost on us, said the spokesperson for the campaign group.ldquoCouncillors discuss the issue of the sweeping beam and unanimously agree that it should be retained. They propose to meet with the Commissioners which happens but yet when campaigners ask to meet with all the districtrsquos elected representatives at one time, we are denied this opportunity. Why The spokesperson added: ldquoWe hope councillors will demand a detailed account of the recent workshop so the views of the Commissioners can be critically examined and scrutinised by not only campaigners, but elected representatives, to determinethey are accurate.ldquoIf, in our opinion they are not, we should be given an opportunity to refute them in front of councillors who were elected to represent the people of this district and who are accountable to them.ldquoIf changes are made at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse, the historic character of the sweeping beam will be lost forever. We must all stand together and ensure this does not happen. What is being offered by the Commissioner is inferior to what we currently have.A council spokesman said officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums.He explained this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for St Johnrsquos Lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.The spokesman added: ldquoRequests for details of future public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar food sauce firm in deal with Aldi  ","story":"PREP House Sauces in Crossgar has won its first business with discount retailer Aldi in the Republic of Ireland.Prep House is a family business which has won a string of national awards for its original sauces and dressings.Itrsquos now supplying its pepper sauce to Aldi for its network of  stores across the Republic.Managing director Paul Bell, who took over the management reins of the company in , described the new deal as ldquoa marvellous boost.ldquoThis very important business for us resulted when we swtly followed up a lead from Invest NIrsquos Drew McIvor, he added.ldquoOur approach was well received by the Aldi buyer who was extremely interested and very supportive.

I am confident that the completed public realm scheme will signicantly enhance the ambitious plans to develop a new retail and commercial centre at this part of Downpatrick.It was confirmed recently that the former police base will not be bulldozed as part of the ambitious multi-million pound plan to regenerate this part of the town.The building mdash which enjoys protected status mdash is to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which, in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Council officials insist the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and view preserving the former station as an opportunity and a challenge, insisting it very much remains part of the overall development project and potentially could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.To date, senior retailers including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in opening new premises at the proposed retail complex which will be built on a huge area of land stretching back as as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue.A council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that while the public realm works were scheduled to complete on March , a utilities company was required to undertake work in Irish Street before the public realm contractor was able to get on site.She added: ldquoDue to unforeseen circumstances experienced by the utilities company on site which required their attention, it resulted in a delay to the completion date of the overall public realm scheme.

He said that in addition to the trauma of suddenly losing a young child, they now faced the added pressure of having to have their child flown to England for post-mortem.Mr McGrath said it was his understanding that the issue impacted on around  families a year, highlighting the importance of doing everything possible for families.ldquoThere are a number of considerations here, suggested Mr McGrath. ldquoWe have to consider the period of time to conclude the post-mortem andthe child to their family for burial.ldquoI am very heartened to hear that the present model involving Liverpool is maintaining the turnaround times. What is also of the utmost importance is supporting the childrsquos family and I am glad to hear that there are bereavement support teams here for families.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThis is not going to be an easy process, however what is absolutely vital is that we get the right long term solution and my colleagues and I will be pressing the government department for that.ldquoCllr Trainor and I met departmental officials to ascertain how we can progress matters for the peace of mind of families here.Explaining the background to sending babies to Liverpool for post-mortem, Cllr Trainor said the paediatric pathologist who was involved in carrying out these procedures in Belfast moved from his current post and there was no one available to fill the position.ldquoFrom our meeting, it is apparent that there is a shortage here of paediatric pathologists and this is why the link with Liverpool has been implemented as a short term solution, he said.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoThe Department of Health is also looking at the possibility of an all island approach. However, such a process would take some time to develop as we look at the possibility of a standardised level of care between north and south.Local health campaigners are also seeking a meeting with senior health chiefs to discuss the issue of child post-mortems being held in Liverpool.The Down Community Health Committee believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.At one of its recent meetings, Mrs Anne Trainor, suggested that the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.She described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

Irsquove recently had money for junction  of the M but I donrsquot have additional fundingfor this.Rod Harrod, chairman of the Dinas Powys Bypass Steering Group, said the bypass plans are ldquomore advanced now than at any time in the last  or even  years.Mr Harrod said improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction would benefit staff, patients, and visitors at Llandough Hospital.Councillors said there could be some competition for Welsh Government funding for the bypass from the proposed works on junction  of the M.Cllr Andrew Robertson, who represents Dinas Powys, said he couldnrsquot understand why there had to be competition for funding with the M scheme.ldquoIf the traffic situation in Dinas Powys is resolved it would benefit every community across the South Wales, Vale of Glamorgan corridor, Cllr Robertson said.Cllr Gwyn John urged the campaign to keep going despite the delays.He said: ldquoI can appreciate how frustrated people involved are with the delays.ldquo[The bypass] is a must. With all the development we have got across the Vale of Glamorgan itrsquos chocka-block. Itrsquos getting worse.ldquoDonrsquot give up, get stuck in. Itrsquos going to be a battle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The body said that patients thinking about surgery should be given thorough information to help them reach a decision and told about the possible risks of mesh procedures, such as painful sexual intercourse.Labour MP Owen Smith, chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Surgical Mesh, said the guidelines ldquodo not go far enough in acknowledging the terrible problems many women have faced following mesh surgery.ldquoI am deeply disappointed that the updated guidelines appear to disregard mesh-injured womenrsquos experiences by stating that there is no long-term evidence of adverse effects, he said.ldquoThousands of women have faced le-changing injuries following mesh surgery and they must not be ignored.Mr Smith added: ldquoWhile I am pleased that Nice is now advising against mesh as a first-line treatment for incontinence, the new guidelines fail to clearly outline that mesh should only be used once conservative methods have failed and when non-mesh surgery has failed.ldquoIt is vital that a proper continence care pathway is established, with surgery as a last resort.#NICE say the true prevalence of long term complications following #mesh surgery is unknown So how can surgeons give women fully informed consent  @carlheneghan @ElneilSuzy @OwenSmith_MP pic lGDuZmuGKLmdash Sling the MeshApril , Kath Sansom, of campaign group Sling The Mesh, said: ldquoWe are appalled that despite political campaigns and the obvious suffering of many women, these guidelines are no dferent from what was published in .ldquoThey are so weak, they clear the way for the next generation of women to be harmed.ldquoWe told our stories and Nice ignored us.In July, the Government announced a ldquopause on some mesh procedures in England, until certain conditions were met.The surgery is not the subject of a ldquoblanket ban and remains available in some circumstances under a ldquohigh vigilance programme.Pelvic organ prolapse is where one of the organs in the pelvis, such as the womb, bowel, bladder or top of the vagina, moves down from its normal position and bulges into the vagina.Non-surgical options recommended as treatment by Nice include losing weight, topical oestrogen and pelvic floor muscle training.For urinary incontinence, caffeine reduction, pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training and medicines are all recommended.Under the guidance, women considering surgery should use new patient guides to help them determine whether it is the right option for them.A follow-up appointment will be offered within six months to those who opt for a procedure, and those who have had complications will be referred to a specialist centre.Any complications will be recorded on a national database, the guidance states.Dr Paul Chrisp, director for the centre for guidelines at Nice, said: ldquoThe patient decision-making aids developed by Nice in association with patients, clinicians and professional bodies will ensure every woman who is considering surgery for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse has the best evidence currently available to inform her of the benefits and risks of each type of procedure.ldquoIt will ensure each woman is able to decide, with the help of her clinician, which option is best for her.ldquoThis might include the decision not to have surgery at all.A Department of Health and Social Carespokeswoman said:ldquoWe know that for some people mesh has had unwanted and serious consequences.ldquoNicersquos new guidelinesand patient decision aids on managing urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse will help women makemore informed choices about their treatment.ldquoTheuseof vaginal meshwas pausedto ensurethatpatientsreceivea high quality and consistent service.ldquoMeshwill still be a treatmentfor some women who understand the risksand followingdiscussions with their consultant.An independent review into the use of mesh procedures, initiated by the DHSC and led byBaroness Julia Cumberlege, is ongoing..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Campaigners criticise  uweak u vaginal mesh guidelines article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Throughout the week, events will be held in a number of venues across the town. One talk - exploring Russell’s work and its influence - will be delivered at St Peter’s Parochial Hall on the Monday evening, while Lurgan Town Hall is the setting for another on the Saturday, ‘AE the Mystic’.On Wednesday night, an Open Mic Night will be held at the Vintage Bar, and will feature poetry readings and live music.Jim Conway, chair of the Lurgan and North Armagh George Russell Festival Society, said he has recognised the growth of the festival in its early years.“The festival has been going from strength to strength and there’s been a lot of interest this year and we have big expectations,” he said. On Russell’s overall legacy, Mr Conway added: “History hasn’t been kind to AE Russell. In fact, a lot of the academics seem to have written him out of history and we’re trying to redress that balance.”This year’s festival - which will run from Monday, April , to Saturday April  -is being supported by the Lurgan Townscape Heritage Partnership, with funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, under the auspices of the Townscape Heritage Scheme.Mr Conway added: “The festival committee would like to take this opportunity to thank all our funders.”An exhibition of Russell’s art and writing will be on view at Brownlow House throughout the week, while a new book containing new information on Russell and his family will be launched to coincide with the festival.Russell - also a political thinker and pacist - has influenced a number of key figures in the world of politics, the arts and literature. Russell left Lurgan when he was eleven years old and relocated to Dublin.For further information on the festival, visit the Lurgan  North Armagh George Russell Festival Society Facebook page.Beattie ‘disappointment’ at erection of Union flags near hospital Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingConcern for missing N.I. girl -

In  the organisation became Reconciliation, Education and Community Training .Over the last  years under her guidancethe organisation has developed and changed from a single identity group to cross community. With the aim of supporting the community and developing programmes to meet their needs it has a core ethos of accepting and respecting people regardless of their background. REACT’s journey through the last  years is a true reflection of the peace process at a community level and Marions dedication to the promotion of good relations.Never afraid to take risks she has worked with others from erse backgrounds in the community to address some of the most contentious issues faced by those who work in the field of community relations.She believes that only through dialogue can dferences be resolved — something which she has demonstrated time and again through her work with loyalist bands.“There are hundredsof parades which pass off peacefully and only a very few which don’t,” she said. “Planning and talking and taking a rational approach have worked for all the areas through the band forums.”Charmain Jones has worked as a Community Relations Officer with Rural CommunityNetworkin Cookstown for over eight years. Charmain currently works with a number of dferent communities on both a single identity and cross community basis.Charmain’s journey in community development and community relations has spanned  years. She first started working for local grass roots organisations both in Portadown and Armagh and now has a regional remit based in RCN offices in Cookstown. Charmain has worked tirelessly to address issues facing iniduals, communities and wider society and is fully committed and passionate in relation to her work. Five years ago Charmain organised a shared history event that became a turning point for her in supporting local communities to truly explore their shared history and heritage. This medium really worked for participants who reported that the approach helped them understand common values. Putting shared history and heritage in the spotlight contributed to and reinforced a sense of belonging.SDLP election posters vandalised Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Since then Charmain has been engaged in numerous shared history courses, workshops and school programmes across rural NI. This work has been recognised by CRC and the Heritage Lottery Fundas a model of good practice. The approach needs almost constant innovation to create new programmes and share ideas with communities that are resistant to change and engage them in good relations projects.It’s no surprise that Marion and Charmain have and continue to collaborate on many projects and are respected and admired by participants and funders alike.Marion Jamison said: “I’m honoured to receive this award from the Community Relations Council. It is so important that community leaders work in the nooks and crannies of local communities to help people who are dealing with so many dficult issues. “Focussing our workon the grass roots level has meant that we have also been able to contribute ideas and approaches that are now being used outside the local communities that we live and work in. “I am proud that the work that I have been able to do with Charmain and others has made and will continue to make a positive impact across Northern Ireland.”Charmain Jones said: “Much thanks goes to my family, friends and colleagues who support me in the work that I am doing. The work that community relations practitioners do is challenging and time intensive.

Belfast Power wants to built the huge plant at Belfast Harbour, which could produce up to half of Northern Irelands electricity at peak times Now, the Department for Infrastructure has issued a notice of opinion to approve the massive development. The firm behind it says  jobs could be supported during the build, with  full-time roles once it’s operational. Work is expected to start in autumn, with the plant up-and-running by  Ciaran Devine, director of Belfast Power Limited said the green light comes at a “critical time for Northern Ireland’s electricity industry, and the power station will play a central role in ensuring we have enough electricity to meet demand over the coming years. “The project also represents a signicant sht towards low-carbon electricity generation in Northern Ireland. Using state-of-the-art Siemens technology, it will be the most efficient of its kind anywhere in the UK and Ireland. “This is good news as we continue the journey towards decarbonisation and will ensure competitive costs, which will benefit consumers. “At a time of considerable uncertainty, we’re proud to be bringing this level of investment to Belfast, which will result in the creation of over  full-time jobs when construction begins and over  full-time roles when the plant is operational. “DfI has been thoroughly professional in its approach to the application since it was submitted in April .

Which makes it even more impressive that, in that time, he’s also managed to start and scale up one of the great business success stories in Northern Ireland, David Meade Events. Known for his skills as a mentalist and speaker, David also runs the company which delivers cutting-edge corporate events, learning and development workshops, and offers keynote speaking services. It has achieved double figure growth every year since its establishment in  working not only in UK and Irish markets, but also internationally. Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn1.jpg","title":"high street in need of leadership to ensure its future","story":"Posted on Monday  March  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland retailers are increasingly frustrated that a lack of government means key areas of reform aren’t being looked at. John Mulgrew speaks to retail experts about the challenges of the high street If there’s one thing Northern Ireland is good at, it’s kicking the can down the road. Again. And while the ongoing political flux at home is being trumped by Brexit, crucial areas of business reform, especially in regards to the ever-evolving retail landscape, aren’t being addressed.And even since the fundamental review and reform of the business rates system was last discussed On the Hill, Northern Ireland and the wider retail landscape has changed further still – with national retailers going to the wall, or narrowly avoiding going bust.“In  our retail sector is in for its fastest ever period of change and reinvention,” Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI says. “This is equally the case for our high streets and town centres.“This change will not all be good, as we will see some more signicant large retail casualties in . However, we will also see the creation of more confident and dynamic independent retailers, who will be at the forefront of a new retail sector, leading toward st century town high streets.”As for the big names facing tough times, HMV called in the administrators once again, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley – a recent fresh lease with the owners of Belfast’s Victoria Square shopping centre securing the only Northern Ireland outlet’s future for the foreseeable future.“It is nothing less than disgraceful that we start a second New Year with no Government in place in Northern Ireland, with not even a date set for all-party talks,” Glyn says.“This is hugely disruptive for the economy and Northern Ireland is in danger of becoming an international laughing stock.“With much-needed decisions not being made on reform of business rates, infrastructure investment, addressing an ever-growing skills gap and modernisation of our town centres, Northern Ireland is not just lagging behind the rest of the UK and Ireland, it is in real danger of being left behind internationally.”Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says there needs to be a fundamental review of the business rates system.“Retail is % of the economy but pays almost a quarter of rates – that is not tenable,” he says. “The structural change in retail is not reflected in the business rates system and we need to widen the tax base.“Stormont being down is a problem, as it affects decisions on business rates and apprenticeship levy, plus the changing face of retail, and a lack of legislation to protect shop workers from abuse and violence.”Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s councils are raising business rates, from the smallest rise in Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, at .%, to the inflation-busting hike of .% from Derry  Strabane District Council. “There is the very real possibility that they will only find out what the regional rate — and their total rates liability — will be the week before those business rates bills hit their doormats,” Aodhan says.Hospitality Ulster’s Colin Neill says the lack of a Government in Northern Ireland is costing the sector millions and damaging the potential for future growth — sighting the lack of progress to modernise liquor licensing as one of its major contributors to the losses.A Liquor Licensing Bill was one of the few pieces of legislation the Assembly had introduced at that time, but the collapse of Stormont killed the Bill, which set out to address the laws.Overall figures point to a mixed bag for the high streets in general. For example Northern Ireland shops in January defied a UK trend slump to rise by almost %, but shop vacancy rates have crept up to %. gtBelfast itself is still recovering from its high street disaster, following the firm at Primark’s Bank Buildings. That led to a city centre drop in footfall of more than a third, while businesses in and around the cordon felt a more considerable drop.“Consumer behaviour is rapidly changing, and people want something dferent from their high streets and I believe that smaller, more agile and tech-savvy retailers who can adapt to this tidal wave of change, will be the ones who will not just survive, but thrive,” Glyn Roberts says.“Government also needs to reboot its policy agenda for the retail sector and for our town centres to meet the challenges ahead.“While devolution remains in limbo, our eleven councils have been doing their level best to fill the gap and provide leadership, despite not having the full ranges of powers to make the real economic changes within their communities.“Retail NI is an organisation working across all  councils, contributing to each of their consultations on local development plans and assisting our members with planning and town centre regeneration.“Local government elections take place in May and Retail NI has already hit the ground running with the publication of our detailed report, ‘Regeneration NI’, which sets out a comprehensive plan to create st century town and city centres. “The regeneration of our town and city centres needs to be the top priority of our local councils and we will be engaging with them and the political parties ahead of the elections.“The Belfast Region and Derry city deals offer huge opportunities for economic, social and infrastructural regeneration for our two main cities and many of our local towns. It is hoped the Belfast Region City Deal will create up to , new and better jobs, alongside delivering a -year programme of inclusive economic growth – including an increase of £m Gross Value Added .”“ will truly be the year of retail reinvention that will see Northern Ireland’s largest sector of industry, perhaps being slightly smaller but more agile, nevertheless a sector, which is vital to the future of our local economy’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"stormont departments compiling emergency no deal brexit contingency list","story":"Posted on Wednesday  March  by John Mulgrew Stormont departments are building a key list of emergency contacts across business and the wider sectors amid contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Ulster Business can reveal.
