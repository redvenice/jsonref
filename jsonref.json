Video: ReutersFormer US president Barack Obama and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry arrive at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Photograph: Jane BarlowPA WireThe world “has to step up, and it has to step up now” in response to climate change, former US president Barrack Obama has said in an address to the UN Cop26 summit in Glasgow.As the gathering faces into its final days of hard negotiation on a deal to limit the extent of global heating, Mr Obama said the climate crisis was the one thing that must transcend day-to-day politics and geopolitics.“What is also true, collectively and inidually we are still falling short. We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we will need to do more,” Mr Obama said in a speech to a plenary gathering.He declared “the US is back” at the forefront of global climate action after “stalling” during the Trump years, and went on to criticise Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin for not joining other leaders at the summit. He said he believed this suggested “a dangerous lack of urgency”.At a closed meeting of members of the “high ambition coalition” (HAC) – which includes Ireland – Mr Obama is understood to have firmly supported developing countries pushing for a climate deal limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees.In his speech earlier, Mr Obama acknowledged progress already made by negotiators in Glasgow but warned that gaps needed to be bridged in coming days.‘More at stake’The biggest force for facing up to the scale of action needed was among young people, he said. “The reason is simple – they have more at stake in this fight than anyone else... If those older people won’t listen, they need to get out the way.”Addressing HAC ministers including Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, Mr Obama said: “What you are doing – what the HAC is attempting to accomplish – is vital.”Noting the coalition’s role in 2015 in ensuring the 1.5 degree target was written into the Paris agreement, he added: “The brutal tempests of the warming climate are making even clearer that we cross that line at our peril. Once again… it falls on the HAC to make that case.”“You’ve come together once again to speak to not only the need to get to 1.5 degrees, but also to provide the adaptation funding that’s necessary for those who may end up paying the steepest price for actions that they themselves did not take.”A draft statement from the HAC circulated on Monday notes “deep concern” over the gap between existing commitments on emissions made at Cop26 and far deeper cuts needed to limit global heating to within 1.5 degrees, “in this decisive decade”. Not all countries in the coalition have signed the statement, but 40 current signatories include groups of developing countries: the Alliance of Small Island States, the Least Developed Countries and the African Group.‘Diplomatic bullying’Bolivia’s chief negotiator Diego Pacheco Balanza has criticised a refusal by richer countries to discuss loss and damage or compensation at Cop26 as evidence of “diplomatic bullying”.“There’s been a systematic attempt by developed countries to remove all discussion about responsibility, compensation and direct climate finance from the negotiations, it’s shameful,” he said.“Instead, they want us to focus on carbon markets and their 2050 net zero narrative, which is completely meaningless. The net zero narrative is a big lie. We need to eliminate greenhouse gases now, not in 30 years.”The first draft of the “Glasgow decision text” published on Monday, which contains no mention of phasing out fossil fuels, was described as exceptionally weak by Jennifer Morgan, director of Greenpeace International.“Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down,” she said. “To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added: ‘fossil fuels phase out’, and countries must come back next year to close the gap.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"google delists 74 irish times items about se%C3%A1n quinn and his family","story":"Seán Quinn jnr, Aoife Quinn and Brenda Quinn at the Four Courts in 2019.

IBRC told the courts it did not accept this was the case.After a lengthy court battle costing millions of euro and involving court hearings in Ukraine, Russia, Belize, Turkey, India and elsewhere, IBRC eventually came to a settlement with the family in 2019.The five adult Quinn children consented to judgments of €88 million each against them, but a stay was placed on registering the judgments as long as they helped secure the return of the international assets.The settlement involved Seán jnr, Ciara, Colette, Aoife and Brenda Quinn.European rulingUnder a 2014 ruling of the European Court of Justice, and subsequent EU data protection laws, people Can request that certain items no longer appear when internet searches are carried out using their name, if they can successfully argue that their case meets certain criteria.Under this “right to be forgotten” rule, search engine operators such as Google can review the request and decide whether to accede to it or not.

Photograph: Christopher FurlongGetty ImagesThe Cop26 summit will generate significant momentum for climate actions across the globe if a detailed and precise rulebook on implementing the landmark Paris agreement emerges from Glasgow this week, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has said. Mr Ryan said that even if only a majority of countries supported a rulebook reinforced by “the same rules, the same reporting, and the same timelines”, it would “build momentum for the decisions you need to take in business, in transport and elsewhere”.The Green Party leader, who is heading the Irish delegation at the conference, took part in the Adaptation Fund Contributor Dialogue, an initiative aimed at scaling up funding to help countries vulnerable to climate change to adapt to its impacts. Ireland is to contribute at least €10 million by the end of next year in the form of grants for developing countries, he said.Adaptation challengeAddressing the adaptation challenge would require an unprecedented level of international co-operation, Mr Ryan said. “I believe it can be done and Ireland is determined to play its part, during the final days of Cop26 this week but also through our efforts at home.”Speaking at the same event, US climate envoy John Kerry said the coming week “can define the decade” in terms of global climate action, warning that if emissions were not reduced enough by 2030, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would be impossible. “The stakes here could not be higher,” he added. Mr Ryan told a press briefing that Cop26 would achieve a good outcome if the rulebook is “absolutely precise” on timelines for reviews and how governments report on their “national determined contributions” for reducing emissions. On reducing methane, he agreed it was the fastest and most effective way to cut emissions. While an international pact, backed by the Government, aiming to reduce global methane levels by 30 per cent by 2030 was not a national target, he believed Ireland would be “centrally involved in addressing methane arising from agriculture and land use”.OffsettingOn a push for carbon markets with options for big business to offset emissions in developing countries, he said he would be nervous about that given the chequered history of offsetting.Ireland has joined the National Adaptation Plan Global Network and committed €1 million to help developing countries build national adaptation plans and become climate-resilient. Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid Colm Brophy announced the funding, which will support small island developing states and the least-developed countries “to strengthen transparency, accountability and inclusion in climate action with a focus on tracking progress on adaptation”. He added: “Adaptation prioritises the needs of those communities most exposed to, and already living with, the impacts of climate change. As such, it is a core priority of Ireland’s international climate action. We are delighted to support the network and look forward to working with likeminded countries in delivering real impact through this group.”Mr Brophy said he hoped to see the commitment to provide $100 billion a year for developing countries as soon as possible underpinned by progress this week towards the target. Commenting on Cop26, he said: “I think there has been a sea change. It’s the first Cop where there is a real meaningful understanding and work with climate finance and adaptation at the heart of it... I hope that will build up trust.”"},{"url":null,"title":"government and eu try to dissuade uk from triggering article 16","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar says planning for potential no-deal Brexit would now restart. Photograph: Julian Behal PA The Government and the EU are urgently seeking to dissuade the UK from triggering article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol, which officials in Dublin and Brussels fear could result in tit-for-tat retaliation between the sides.There have been face-to-face contacts this week between senior figures from the Irish and British governments as the UK makes its case for triggering the mechanism, but Dublin remains fiercely opposed to such a move.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Tuesday said planning for a potential no-deal Brexit would now recommence.There has been a growing expectation in Brussels and Dublin that British prime minister Boris Johnson’s administration is moving towards using the clause to unilaterally suspend aspects of the protocol, which was designed to avoid a hard border on the island after the UK left the EU.Article 16 is an emergency clause in the protocol which can be activated unilaterally if the agreement leads to “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade”.Westminster is insisting that triggering article 16 would neither be illegitimate nor illegal, and is provided for in the treaty. However, the EU side strongly disputes the basis for invoking it and Government figures in Dublin have warned that the move would endanger the entire EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement.There was strong pushback from EU officials on Tuesday against suggestions that the European Commission was preparing options to escalate and impose swift retaliatory measures should London press ahead with the move.Officials say they are working to steer the British government away from any potential triggering of the sensitive clause ahead of a meeting between chief negotiators Maros Sefcovic and Lord David Frost later this week.Mr Sefcovic is to update EU ambassadors on the progress of talks with the UK on Wednesday and is expected to stress the union’s commitment to “pragmatic solutions”.Legal redressIn the background, there has been preparation for legal redress and far-reaching responses that could affect the overall trade deal between the UK and the EU. However, sources stressed that these were not at the stage of being presented to ambassadors and the emphasis remained on working to find a solution through negotiation.“We have come with a far-reaching package of proposals, so-called bespoke arrangements, to facilitate the implementation of the agreement, and we think that this can be the basis for discussion and agreement,” EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday.Britain has said the package does not go far enough and has insisted that the role of the European Court of Justice as an arbiter of disputes must be removed. However, Brussels says this is a condition for Northern Ireland to participate in the EU’s Single Market.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the British government had been asking the European Union to “deliver the impossible” on the protocol.There was now a “very serious risk” that the Conservative administration would trigger article 16, Mr Coveney told an Oireachtas committee.Mr Varadkar said the Cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee met on Monday to “essentially dust down and restart contingency preparations” in case a trade war developed with the UK. Sources said Ministers would be asked to engage with their UK counterparts to stress the dangers of triggering article 16.“Our preference is to find a consensual solution that deals with the problems which exist. As we have said consistently, we will use the article 16 safety mechanism if solutions cannot be found.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics sinn fein a party preparing for government","story":"At Sinn Féin’s ardfheis in Dublin last weekend, a motion in support of the non-jury Special Criminal Court was passed, representing a considerable shift in position and removing a significant hurdle to the party’s ambitions to lead the next government.

Photograph: Alan Betson The Dáil reconvened at two o’clock on Tuesday.Anyone playing the Mary Lou Leaders’ Questions drinking game (raise your glass for every cliche) would have been completely buckled by quarter past.But with investment funds buying up forever homes as her chosen topic, anyone foolish enough to risk their liver had only themselves to blame.Relying on a story from Viscount Rothermere’s Irish Daily Mail, the Sinn Féin leader grabbed a golden opportunity to tackle the Taoiseach for the umpteenth time on an issue dear to her heart: cuckoo funds.On Saturday, Craig Hughes reported that the Department of Finance is planning to hold “roadshows” next year aimed at enticing international funds to invest in Irish residential property.Apparently the boys with the big bucks are “spooked” by the ongoing political ructions here over institutional investors bulk-buying houses and elbowing inidual homebuyers out of the market.Recent tax changes, coupled with uncertainty over whether more might be in the pipeline, have fuelled uncertainly and the Merrion Street mandarins feel “a market-facing event” fronted by a couple of heavyweight Ministers might encourage international capital into the country.According to departmental documents, two names are in the frame. Comments from their spokespeople indicate that Paschal Donohoe, the Fine Gael Minister for Finance, seems gung-ho about the wheeze but Darragh O’Brien, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Housing, does not appear so enthusiastic about attending.“State’s ploy to attract cuckoo funds” was the headline over Saturday’s piece. To be fair to Mary Lou McDonald, neither she nor her speech writer were going to pass up on a chance to repeatedly clobber the Taoiseach around the ears with the words “cuckoo funds”.Dozen mentionsShe fell just one short of a dozen mentions in the course of two questions, enough to render most devotees of the Mary Lou Leaders’ Questions drinking game pie-eyed.“Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have bent over backwards for cuckoo funds,” she began.“Sweep in” and “gobble up homes” from “under the noses of ordinary home-buyers.”“They literally hung the flag of surrender up over Dublin for these investors.”Paschal Donohoe and Darragh O’Brien are “looking to dust off the red carpet and roll it out” for these wealthy institutions.Down the hatch!“Here we go again with a Fianna Fáil-led government and cuckoo funds.”Faced with the choice of looking after hard-pressed renters and big business, “well, you’ve shown whose side you’re on.”The Taoiseach and his Ministers are “running after” and “cosying up” even further to these wealthy funds.Government politicians know that being closely associated with international investment firms and pension fund vehicles is toxic.“There is no public support for this insanity,” the Sinn Féin leader told the Taoiseach. She is pushing an open door here – a simple action in itself which too many iniduals and families can’t afford to do these days because of a dysfunctional property market.Inward investmentSo what about “your Ministers’ proposed cuckoo fund roadshow”, Mary Lou asked Micheál Martin, forever linking the department’s inward investment drive to the publicly reviled bulk-buy-to-rent-out merchants.Did he know about it? Does he approve of it? Who were his Ministers going to meet? What new, extra sweetheart deals are they going to promise the investors buying up ordinary people’s houses?Straight off, in Irish and then in English, the Taoiseach said the Sinn Féin leader is wrong in her assertion that his Government is in league with financial cuckoo and vulture funds.But Mary Lou wasn’t backing down, despite a very comprehensive rundown from Micheál detailing building projects completed or under way along with the many policy and funding initiatives his Government has put in place to address the housing crisis.“Why do I say all of that?” he asked at the end of delivering this extensive list.“Because you don’t want to answer my question,” said Mary Lou.He was saying it to counter her “propaganda spin” masquerading as a question and “designed to portray Government housing policy as being exclusively about one thing and one thing only”. Trying to make it out as being almost exclusively about cuckoo funds was “wide of the mark, disingenuous and dishonest”, he said angrily.As for this planned roadshow?“There is no roadshow,” he snapped at the end of a shouting match between the two. “Not true. Not true.”Who said anything about being against investment? “Nobody,” said Mary Lou. “Ireland is open for business. We all know that.”LessonsBut the cuckoo funds. What sweetheart deals are they getting to entice them over here? Has the Government learned any lessons at all? Not at all, concluded Mary Lou. Here we go again with Fianna Fáil in Government and cuckoo funds.“Soundbite nonsense,” fumed the Minister for Housing.Of course, in this long-running cuckoo conflict between Mary Lou and Micheál, the Taoiseach has amassed a few favourite soundbites of his own.Time to open another bottle?In what was deputy McDonald indulging? “A lot of bluff and bluster.” Chin-chin!“And nothing to back it up.”Mary Lou was not amused. “You’re making a show of yourself,” she told him.Really? Micheál noted that all the Government gets from Sinn Féin when it brings in legislation on affordable housing is “repeated negativity and opposition”.“Until, wait for it, what happens when the isions bells ring? Sinn Féin meekly go in and support the affordable housing legislation.” The party’s “extraordinary, repeated and consistent” opposition to housing developments all over the country is “rank hypocrisy”.No roadshow and no cosying up to cuckoo funds, insisted Micheál.“Out of order,” complained the Taoiseach as the barrage continued.“Many things are out of order,” said the Sinn Féin leader.The Minister for Housing came in with a sliding tackle, bringing hostilities to close.“You take everything from the Daily Mail,” shouted Darragh O’Brien.At the end, they all looked like they needed a stiff drink.Within an hour of the exchanges, Sinn Féin had a tweet up along with a video clip.“Here we go again! The Government looks set to delay vital transport infrastructure across the state BUT the FFFG roadshow to attract more Cuckoo funds into Ireland is still on track –”And so did the party leader. “Govt cozying up to Cuckoo funds as our people face a housing crisis. Taoiseach won’t answer questions on this – just bluff and bluster. #FFFGCuckoos”"},{"url":null,"title":"russia faces climate change reckoning as putin stays away from cop26","story":"Roza Khutor, a ski village built for the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Caucasus mountains: Ecologists say thousands of hectares of forest were destroyed during its construction. Photograph: Daniel McLaughlinRussian president Vladimir Putin is not attending the UN climate talks in Glasgow, and declined to commit the world’s fourth-biggest polluter to pacts agreed there to cut the use of coal and emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.Russia has instead put much of its focus at Cop26 on the need to save trees, and joined more than 100 other states in pledging to stop deforestation by 2030.The promise may surprise ecologists who say thousands of hectares of forest and other important wildlife habitat were destroyed by massive building work ordered by Putin before the 2014 Winter Olympics, which Russia hosted in Sochi on the Black Sea and 65km away in the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana.Then, ancient woodland in the Caucasus mountains was felled to make way for Putin’s pet project. Now, he hopes to use Russia’s forests – the biggest in the world, containing about a fifth of all trees – to help its energy firms make the painful transition to a greener future.Three decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the vast hydrocarbon reserves that underpinned its economy are still Russia’s mainstay, and oil and gas sales account for more than half of export revenue and a third of the national budget.During his 21-year rule, Putin has repeatedly vowed to ersify Russia’s economy, but the latest rankings by the respected RBK newspaper show that the nation’s three biggest firms are oil and gas producers, and that nine of its 15 largest corporations work in hydrocarbons and power generation the equivalent US list, published by Forbes, includes only one energy company in the top 15.“Beginning in the 2030s, the external effects on Russia will be severe,” Thane Gustafson says of the impact of efforts to halt global warming in his new book Klimat, Russia in the Age of Climate Change.“Climate politics, technological change and energy transition outside Russia will cause a sharp drop in Russia’s income from the export of fossil fuels – mainly oil – which are the lifeblood of the economy,” the Georgetown University professor explains.“The resulting massive loss of wealth will affect Russian citizens at all levels but will especially impact the state... This in turn will have major consequences for Russia’s position in the global economy, and its standing as a great power.”Gustafson thinks climate change could help boost Russia’s already booming agricultural sector, increase cargo shipping along its Arctic coast, and raise international demand for its nuclear power technology and liquefied natural gas.But he estimates that the global shift away from oil, coal and eventually gas could cause Russia’s total export income to fall by about 30 per cent by 2050.“The core question is, if peak oil demand comes to pass and peak gas demand comes to pass in Europe, then what else have the Russians got?” Gustafson told The .“The big story is that all the alternatives, when you compare them to today’s export revenues from oil and gas, just don’t add up.”Wildfires and floodsPutin (69) was dismissive of climate change for years, but now addresses the issue often and said last month that Russia wanted to be carbon neutral by 2060.Moscow has been alarmed by major wildfires and floods and by some thawing of the permafrost that covers 65 per cent of Russia, where scientists say national temperatures are rising 2.5 times faster than the global average.The EU’s announcement in July of plans to introduce a special carbon tax on imports from 2026 also focused the minds of Russian officials.Igor Sechin, the head of Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil firm, has reportedly warned the Kremlin that the tariff could cost the country far more than western sanctions imposed over its undeclared war against Ukraine.The tax will be levied initially on carbon-intensive products such as steel, aluminium and fertiliser, but Russia fears it could be expanded to cover oil and gas imports as the EU accelerates its move away from fossil fuels.Moscow frames the EU tax as an attack on Russian industry, and Putin has urged countries “to put aside political and other differences and not turn the transition to carbon neutrality into an instrument of unfair competition”.Weapon against RussiaRussian media are giving considerable coverage to climate issues now that they are on the Kremlin agenda, yet much reporting on Cop26 echoes the claim that the West is using the shift to greener energy as a weapon against Russia.The popular Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper told readers during Cop26 that Washington saw the climate crisis as a way to “control the development of sovereign states”.“With this approach, countries for which sovereignty has not yet become an empty phrase will be blamed for any failures of the climate agenda,” the newspaper wrote. “This is probably why the heads of Russia, China, Brazil, Turkey and some other developed countries are not at the Glasgow summit.”He made clear what the Kremlin wants from the West at Cop26: for nuclear power – the source of 20 per cent of Russian electricity – to be recognised as clean energy acceptance of Russia’s estimate of how much carbon its vast forests can swallow and willingness to recognise a future Russian carbon trading system that would allow its polluters to offset emissions by planting and protecting trees.In a recorded speech to the summit, Putin said Russia’s bid to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 relied in part “on the unique natural resource of its forest ecosystems and their significant capacity to absorb carbon dioxide”.“We are taking the strongest and most vigorous measures to conserve them, improving forest management, fighting illegal logging and forest fires, increasing the area of reforestation and steadily increasing funding for these purposes,” he said.Putin has said Russia’s forests can absorb “billions of tonnes” of greenhouse gasses and his deputy prime minister, Viktoria Abramchenko, has put the figure at 2.5 billion tonnes annually – enough to make Russia carbon neutral at a stroke.Carbon tariffsRussian officials and business chiefs are also discussing the creation of national system of carbon tariffs, which they hope would allow firms to pay a pollution tax to Moscow instead of to Brussels and exempt them from EU levies.Sceptics say agreement on how Russia is managing and monitoring its forests and whether its biggest firms are really paying their taxes requires a level of trust that is glaringly absent from relations between Moscow and the West.They also criticise the Kremlin’s focus on how much pollution Russia’s forests can absorb, rather than on cutting emissions or reliance on fossil fuels, but see it as no surprise in an economy built around energy giants run by men like Sechin and Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller, who have worked with Putin since the 1990s.“Taken as a whole, the history of the Putin era can be summed up as one of the dominant political power of the hydrocarbon lobby, backed by Putin’s closest allies and underpinned by the security establishment,” Gustafson writes in Klimat.“Putin’s policy has deepened Russia’s dependence on natural resource exports, and the longer it continues, the more vulnerable Russia will become, as the effects of climate change, both external and internal, gather strength. Elite conversation in Russia today is just beginning to recognise this problem.”Speaking from the US, Gustafson said there was now “a swirl of voices, a swirl of interests” in Moscow around climate change.“They are fully up to speed on the issues, threats and narratives and the conversations going on in the West. How do they react? That depends who they are.”Anit-Moscow conspiracyPowerful hard-liners such as Russian security council chief Nikolai Patrushev tend to regard the topic as an anti-Moscow conspiracy, while liberal reformers hope it provides impetus for the economic overhaul they have sought for many years.Gazprom seeks a long energy transition via the “bridge” fuel of gas, and talks about filling pipelines with hydrogen when that cleaner future finally comes.Sechin argues that oil demand will hold up for longer than many predict, and that Russia and Rosneft can make huge profits by continuing to invest in the oil sector as western majors switch their focus and funding to alternative energy.It is a risky and expensive bet: Rosneft is pushing on with its immense €120 billion Vostok project in the Arctic even as some researchers warn that if big economies hit their carbon-emission targets, more than €1 trillion in Russian energy assets such as drilling rigs and pipelines could be worthless by 2036.That is also when Putin, in power since 2000, will no longer be eligible for the presidency, according to constitutional amendments that he signed this year.In the name of “stability”, Putin and his allies have devoted much of their energy to holding back reforms. In the next two decades, a generation of postponed changes – political, economic and environmental – may crash over Russia in a single wave.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Energy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc interviewers subtly laughed indian accent claims job candidate","story":"A panel of BBC executives “subtly laughed” at a candidate’s Indian accent during a job interview, it has been claimed.Malika Keswani, a former BBC production manager, is suing the corporation for racial discrimination.She said her treatment in the interview was so demoralising that she sought help from an accent coach.Ms Keswani said she was only asked to apply for roles “so the BBC could meet its requirements to interview a erse candidate”.The situation triggered panic attacks and anxiety, she claimed.In documents filed with the Central London Employment Tribunal, Ms Keswani said the impact on her health was “unbearable” and she was subsequently diagnosed with PTSD. She no longer works for the BBC.Ms Keswani joined the Persian Service, part of the World Service, in March 2019, after applying unsuccessfully for jobs in the news and current affairs ision.She soon felt “pigeon-holed” and believed bosses wanted to keep her in a department where her “face fits”.In February 2020, she applied for a job as a production manager with BBC Sport, based in Salford. The all-white panel consisted of Debbie Dubois and Rachel Wright, both heads of production in the sports department, and Mel Adams, one of the corporation’s talent managers.“Throughout the interview, the panel nodded and smiled at times but I noticed that, based on the way I spoke, the focus was on how I was saying things rather than what I was saying.“I noticed the panel subtly laughing while trying to contain their laughter. This drew my attention to my soft Indian accent,” Ms Keswani said.The interview involved being marked on “soft skills”, but Ms Keswani said the concept was a racist one.She claimed that she was then “unfairly and unjustifiably scored as the weakest candidate” and a white candidate got the job.“I felt I needed to ‘code switch’ after the sport interview and engaged an accent coach,” she said.In April 2020, Ms Keswani filed a grievance claim and that same month attended accident and emergency due to a panic attack. She claimed that she was then “victimised” until she left the corporation in October 2020.She said: “My anxiety was precipitated by the conduct of the BBC and the treatment offered to me thereafter. “I had been under the impression the BBC was an equal opportunities employer, but I had faced nothing but barriers and suppression.”The BBC denies the claims.

and it came tantalisingly close.But the dire economic conditions of 1981 robbed the Aston Martin Bulldog of the chance to smash the record for which it had been designed.Instead, the supercar with its futuristic wedge-shaped design and gull-wing doors was sold to bolster the company’s ailing finances, having reached a speed of 191.8 mph.Now, with the help of the Royal Navy, the Bulldog is on the brink of achieving its destiny, having undergone a 6,000-hour restoration.On Tuesday, it was paraded on the deck of Britain’s newest aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, a meeting of the most advanced maritime and military technology of 2021 with the cutting-edge automotive engineering of 1981.Over the next three months, the car will be trialled at ever-increasing speeds on a number of naval airfields, en route to its intended target of a 200mph run. For Richard Gauntlett, son of Victor Gauntlett, the one-time chairman of Aston Martin who was forced to sell the Bulldog as the energy crisis prompted a UK recession, the restoration and renewed record attempt are the realisation of a childhood dream.“It’s quite a British story in that the car was built in a time of great adversity and it has been restored in a time of great adversity,” he told The . “It’s a great piece of British engineering and ingenuity.”With its 5.3-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the Bulldog was designed to be the fastest production road car ever built, with a projected top speed of 237mph.Keith Martin, the test driver for the 191.8mph run in 1981, was adamant that the car was still accelerating as he was forced to abandon the drive due to running out of runway.Beset by financial woes and nervous about asking customers to fork out £200,000 for one of the 25 Bulldogs they had originally planned to build, Aston Martin abandoned the project, eventually selling the one they had to a collector from the Middle East.In the intervening four decades, the car had acquired the mystique of a “mythical beast”, said Mr Gauntlett, occasionally popping up at a car show before returning to the invisibility of a series of private owners.Most recently, Mr Gauntlett tracked down Bulldog to a storage unit in the Far East.It was then purchased by his friend Phillip Sarofim, a Texan billionaire and former boyfriend of the singer Avril Lavigne.Over 18 months, a team of 60 specialists at Classic Motor Cars in Shropshire, with the involvement of Royal Navy engineers, worked on restoring the Bulldog, updating the original design with an electronic fuel injector and an inbuilt rollbar to protect the driver.“It was cutting edge then and it’s cutting edge now,” said Mr Gauntlett. “We’re showing it to a world that’s forgotten.”Crucial to the ambition of the Bulldog was that, unlike many rival supercars, it should be as comfortable as the Aston Martins that preceded it.It was therefore built with upholstered leather and a walnut trim.“The idea was to produce the first car to go 200mph but to deliver Aston Martin customers in the style in which they had become accustomed,” said Mr Gauntlett. “They didn’t want to bend themselves in half.”The Bulldog will be driven by Darren Turner, the Aston Martin race and test driver.Mr Gauntlett and Mr Sarofim believe they may eventually have to go to Germany to find a runway long enough to achieve 200 mph.More from NewsCop26 draft deal revealed: Cutting greenhouse gases by next year and phasing out coal and fossil fuelsWatch: The Duke of Sussex says he warned Twitter about a \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 the day before Capitol Hill riotsNobel Peace Prize winner Malala marries in BirminghamPoland\u0026#39s dire warning to scare migrants from border: Belarusian soldiers are trying to poison you with pillsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford university owes explanation jewish students taking mosley","story":"Oxford University should explain to Jewish students why it took money from the Mosley family, the Education Secretary has said - as he warned that anti-Semitism is not “simply a historic debate”.Intervening for the first time in the row over “fascist” cash, Nadhim Zahawi said the university’s leadership must attempt to repair its relationship with Jewish students by “making sure they consult and explain the decision-making process” to them.His remarks come amid growing pressure on Oxford University and some of its colleges after The  revealed that they have accepted more than £12.3 million worth of donations from the Mosley family trust.Speaking from Auschwitz, where he was visiting Nazi death camps ahead of the 83rd anniversary of Kristallnacht, Mr Zahawi cautioned that anti-Semitism was “a present danger and a scourge” on British campuses.Mr Zahawi urged universities to adopt the International Holocaust Rememberance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism, saying it sent a “clear and important message” that anti-Jewish hate would not be tolerated.Asked how Oxford could repair relations with Jewish students over the Mosley money, he said: By reaching out and making sure they consult and explain the decision-making process that took place for them to have landed on this donation.Mr Zahawi said universities should consider the “ethical implications” of the donations they accept and should take into account the views of students and the wider community.“I would expect our great seats of learning like Oxford to be quite capable of dealing with these issues in an appropriate and sensitive way,” he said. He added that it was “incredibly important” for universities to “carry the confidence of the student body”.Oxford University’s Jewish society has said it is “distressed” to learn of the donations, adding that the Mosley family name is “synonymous with fascism and anti-Semitism in Britain”.The society went on to point out that the university’s decision to dedicate a professorship to the family\u0027s name “serves to commemorate and revere the Mosley legacy”. It added that the absence of any consultation with Jewish students was “inconsiderate and inappropriate”.Mr Zahawi said that if universities failed to consider the views of Jewish students, the risk was “obvious”, adding: “Let me be very clear. Anti-Semitism is not simply a historic debate, it is a present danger and a scourge that exists, sadly, on our campuses.“It is really important that universities take this very seriously, which is why the IHRA is so crucial as a tool for universities and other public bodies in rooting out anti-Semitism wherever it emerges.”He said that universities accepting the IHRA definition was “only the first step” towards eradicating anti-Semitism from the education system.Figures being released on Wednesday from the Office for Students show that 95 universities have signed up to the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, up from 28 last September.“I think universities have a duty to protect the safety of their Jewish students and make sure they are never targeted because of their religion or race,” Mr Zahawi said.“No one in our society, least of all students, should have to deal with this insidious and unique form of discrimination.”Last week, The  revealed that Oxford University was given £6 million from a charitable trust set up by Max Mosley to house the fortune he inherited from his father, Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists.Meanwhile two of Oxford’s colleges - St Peter’s and Lady Margaret Hall - have also accepted cash from the Mosley family trust totalling more than £6.3 million.The university is now facing a donor backlash, with one benefactor vowing not to give St Peter’s College “another penny”.Meanwhile, four British Nobel laureates have urged the university to reconsider endowing a professorship in the name of the grandson of Sir Oswald Mosley, saying that doing so dishonours their subject.Mr Zahawi, who was in Auschwitz this week for an education symposium organised by the European Jewish Association, said that visiting the death camps was a “life-changing” experience for him.He said: You cant help but fall silent, it is just the sheer, industrial scale of murder and the atrocities. No film reel prepares you for ... the systematic nature of the way they went about the extermination of the Jewish population.Oxford University, St Peter’s College and Lady Margaret Hall all said that the funds they received from the Mosley trust were cleared by an independent committee, which reviewed donations in a “robust” manner, taking “legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration”.On Tuesday, police were called to guard the entrance of the London School of Economics, where students were demonstrating against the Israeli ambassador, who was addressing the university\u0027s debating society.Pro-Palestinian activists gathered outside to call for Tzipi Hotovely to be no-platformed and chanted that Israel was a terrorist state.Protesters carried Palestinian flags during the demonstration, with some students saying they were blocked from attending classes. The debating society is next week hosting Husam Zomlot, the Head of the Palestinian Mission to the UK. More from NewsNHS must be \u0026#39careful\u0026#39 with numbers, warns Health Secretary in wake of Amanda Pritchard errorCop26 draft deal revealed: Cutting greenhouse gases by next year and phasing out coal and fossil fuelsWatch: The Duke of Sussex says he warned Twitter about a \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 the day before Capitol Hill riotsNobel Peace Prize winner Malala marries in BirminghamMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictured nobel peace prize winner malala marries birmingham","story":"Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever winner of a Nobel Prize, has surprised her millions of followers by announcing she had got married.In the latest instalment of her already extraordinary life, Malala, 24, posted photographs on social media of her wedding to Asser Malik, a cricket coach with the Pakistan national team. On Twitter, Malala spoke of her joy “for the journey ahead”. The couple were married at what was described as a “small ceremony” in Birmingham, which she made her home following the assassination attempt that catapulted her into the world’s consciousness.Nine years after being shot in the head and left for dead by a Taliban gunman, Malala wrote on social media: “Today marks a precious day in my life. Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life. “We celebrated a small nikkah ceremony at home in Birmingham with our families. Please send us your prayers. We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead.”It is unclear how the couple met but they were first photographed together along with cricketers and dignitaries at Lord\u0027s cricket ground two years ago during the cricket world cup. They were then pictured together at Edgbaston a few days later at another match.  Their relationship had been kept secret from the wider world.Malala grew up in the Swat Valley in Pakistan and had already become a prominent campaigner for girls’ education when she was targeted by the Taliban. She was shot in the head in an attempted assassination as she travelled home from school and in the aftermath airlifted from one Pakistan hospital to another before being flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for treatment. The Taliban issued a statement, declaring that if she survived they would target her again.Malala made Birmingham her new home and used it as a base to continue her campaigning. She wrote a best-selling book I Am Malala in 2013 and a year later was awarded the Nobel peace prize. She won a place at the University of Oxford to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in 2020.In a recent interview with Vogue magazine, published in its July edition, Malala had been dismissive of the idea of marriage. “I still don’t understand why people have to get married,” she told the magazine, adding “If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can’t it just be a partnership?”Malala told the interviewer that her mother had been scornful of her position.Her husband Asser Malik is general manager in the high performance department with the Pakistan Cricket Board. In the run up to the surprise wedding, he has been seemingly preoccupied on Twitter with the progress of the Pakistan cricket team which has reached the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup being played in the United Arab Emirates.The only clue to his burgeoning relationship with Malala is when he posted on Twitter in July a birthday message to his bride-to-be which read “Happy Birthday to the most amazing Malala” and with it a photograph of the couple standing side by side. Dignitaries last night began to send their messages of congratulation to the newlyweds.More from NewsCop26 draft deal revealed: Cutting greenhouse gases by next year and phasing out coal and fossil fuelsWatch: The Duke of Sussex says he warned Twitter about a \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 the day before Capitol Hill riotsPoland\u0026#39s dire warning to scare migrants from border: Belarusian soldiers are trying to poison you with pillsRoyal family pictures of the week: Prince Charles meets Stella McCartney and tries out cake decoratingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"skys limit winners 2021 royal air force photographic competition","story":"The Royal Air Force Photographic Competition is always hotly contested and this year was no different. Nearly 1,500 images and more than 50 videos were submitted across the competition’s seven categories of Personnel, Current RAF Equipment, RAF Operations and Exercises, the Mallett Student Trophy, Section Portfolio, Video and “Peoples’ Choice”.Cpl Lee Matthews had a very successful competition winning three categories.

It will make France the first EU country to declare the third jab mandatory. It is expected that the rules will apply to tourists and expats. In a televised address, the French president said that, from Dec 15, the over-65s and the most fragile will only be recognised as fully vaccinated on France\u0027s Covid health pass if they have had a booster.Meanwhile, mandatory vaccines could result in 123,000 staff leaving health and social care, the Government’s own analysis suggests. Sajid Javid announced that Covid jabs would become mandatory for NHS frontline staff - but not until April. An impact report estimates that even then, around 88,000 health workers, including 73,000 NHS staff, are likely to remain unvaccinated, along with 35,000 social care workers.

Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Nov | commentsCovid vaccination passports could be extended to include pubs in Scotland, the Deputy First Minister has suggested. John Swinney warned that Scotland was still in a “precarious and unpredictable” situation with regards to the virus with winter looming. He warned: “If the previous pattern, characterised by waves of infection, is repeated, there is a risk that the spread of the virus could, very quickly, increase again during the coming weeks, perhaps over the Christmas period.”With the NHS already under “intense pressure”, Mr Swinney said that “some scenarios for what may happen next are very concerning”, telling MSPs there was a “need to avoid the most dangerous of those scenarios”.He stressed that the Scottish Government wanted to avoid having to reimpose “the sort of strict lockdowns we had seen before most of us were vaccinated”.  But he insisted: “We do need to take appropriate measures to keep the pandemic under control. “It is because we want to avoid more dficult restrictions that we cannot rule out strengthening the baseline protective measures currently in place as the best way to head off any prospect of future lockdowns.” The Covid restrictions in place in Scotland will be reviewed again next week, Mr Swinney said. The coronavirus-gtcoronavirus certication scheme requires people going to nightclubs and to other large-scale events – such as concerts and some football matches – to be able to prove they have received two doses of vaccine. Other possible measures could see work being required to improve ventilation, steps to increase home working and “whether changes are needed to extend use of face coverings”. At the moment, no decisions had been made yet. The Government would be “discussing options with business sector organisations this week”. Mr Swinney was giving the regular coronavirus update to MSPs in place of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who was at the Cop climate change summit in Glasgow.  He told the Parliament that there were “some specic reasons to suspect that case numbers may increase in the weeks ahead”.The Deputy First Minister said: “With the onset of colder winter weather, increased time spent indoors means there will likely be more opportunities for Covid to circulate.“Cop has seen people from all over the world meeting in Glasgow – and that presents a known infection risk. “And many of us will wish to spend time visiting loved ones over the festive period.” Comment MORE ON Scottish GovernmentJohn SwinneyPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Department of Health and Social Care accepted there may be a “signicant” hit to the health service workforce as millions are told ‘no jab, no job’.Ministers today announced patient-facing healthcare staff in England will need to have had both doses of vaccine by April , unless they have a medical exemption, as a condition of deployment.That includes doctors, nurses and dentists as well as cleaners, porters, ward clerks and receptionists. Private healthcare, unpaid volunteers, agency staff and trainees are all included.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the scales clearly tip to one side for mandatory jabs - due to our imperative to protect the NHS and those services upon which we all rely.But a government impact statement has now estimated , health and care staff could refuse to be vaccinated under the policy, without having a medical exemption.  That includes , staff in the NHS in England in a central scenario - .% of the workforce. It also includes , in private healthcare . And it includes , in social care , where jabs will become mandatory this Thursday. Once natural wastage is included the government estimates this figure at more like ,. The documents do not make clear whether all , staff would be working on the frontline currently. It appears possible that some are already in back office roles. Itaposs thought patient-facing staff who refuse to be jabbed will face being reassigned to back office roles or losing their jobs completely. The impact statement confirmed hospitals will have to pay for “recruiting replacements for workers who may not fulfil the requirement of having both doses of the vaccine”. This in turn could cause “potential disruption to health and care services”.  The impact statement warned there was a wide range of possibilities of how many health and care staff will get vaccinated in response to the scheme - anywhere from , to ,.It said there is signicant uncertainty about the final number of staff affected. However, it added: The impact on workforce levels and health and care services could be signicant. If a proportion of staff decides to leave the NHS, this would put pressure on NHS services. This is likely to be more acute in clinical staff groups where there are existing staff shortages and lags in labour supply caused by education and training requirements, but all services are likely to be impacted.It comes after unions and Labour warned of possible staff shortages.UNISON today warned some care homes could be forced to shut their doors and others will struggle to meet safe staffing levels.  On the NHS changes, UNISON head of health Sara Gorton added: This wasn’t something the government needed to do. “The effective and supportive approach taken by NHS trusts has persuaded the overwhelming majority of health staff to have both Covid shots. “Now this sledgehammer policy risks doing more harm than good. “Without knowing what proportion of staff are covered by exemptions, creating a new law seems extreme. “It will move effort and attention away from caring for Covid patients and clearing the backlog created by the pandemic.” Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth warned ministers to “proceed with caution”, adding: We simply cannot afford to lose thousands of NHS staff overnight. Some MPs sounded caution over the move - but others said it should have happened quicker. Tory MP Dr Andrew Murrison said: “If this has to be done, then it is better to do it quickly, and by the Spring, clearly we’re going to be past the winter pressures we’re all concerned about.” Mr Javid warned it cannot be business as usual when it comes to vaccination, adding: The first duty of everyone working in health and social care is to avoid preventable harm to the people they care for. “Not only that, they have a responsibility to do all they can to keep each other safe.” But Rachel Harrison of the GMB union warned: Bulldozing this vaccine will exacerbate the already crushing staffing crisis we face across the NHS and ambulance services. Both are operating under extreme pressures, after a decade of austerity and cuts, with an exhausted and demoralised workforce who are fearful of what is to come as we head through winter. Staff are already leaving their employment and this will certainly force many more to go. Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Pat Cullen added: The vast majority of NHS nursing staff received the COVID- vaccine as soon as it was offered, having led the vaccination roll out across the UK and continuing to do so with the booster programme. “With the five months until this decision takes effect, the government and employers must continue to engage with the small minority who have chosen not to have the vaccine. “This is vital to understanding their concerns, supporting them to understand the importance of the vaccine and to make that important choice.

But when his symptoms got worse, the family received some terrible newsAt first, the issues were dismissed as just reflux Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByJessica TaylorReal le features writer:,  Nov | commentsWhen Jill Ferrariaposs -week-old son, Huey, started snoring at night, she thought little of it. Heaposd so far been a healthy baby, born at full term with no complications, and seemed perfectly fine. But as the weeks passed, Jill, from Sydney in Australia, began to notice her baby boy was becoming more and more unsettled - and she realised something was going on. Speaking to news.au, the mum said: “I went and saw numerous dferent doctors, went to a community health nurse, and they all said it was just normal, newborn behaviour and unsettledness. She added other doctors had suggested Huey was just suffering from reflux.Jill noticed that, as well as being unsettled, Huey was also a noisy breather and tended to breathe through his mouth. She added he wassnoring quite a lot.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Jill said Huey would fall asleep during the day and wake up making high-pitched squeals, which she took as an indication that something wasnapost right. When she realised Huey also wasnapost gaining weight, Jill managed to get her son referred to a paediatrician. She recalls that, after taking a look at her son, the doctor started getting a little bit flustered. After measuring Hueyaposs abdomen and neck, Jill said the doctor gave her some devastating news. She recalled him saying: I’m really sorry, but I think your baby’s got cancer. “We were flabbergasted. We just thought he had severe reflux and we needed some better medication or something,” Jill said.  She added that, until that point, sheaposd been given no indication it could have been so severe. The family was sent to Sydney Childrenaposs Hospital immediately. On the way there, Jill recalls being in complete shock. “It is a little bit of a blur. A lot of things happened quickly [when we arrived at the hospital], and that’s when you know that things are serious. When the hospital moves exceptionally fast, that means they’re worried,” she said. A biopsy confirmed the awful diagnosis - Huey had stage four S neuroblastoma. He had an inoperable tumour measuring cm on his neck and cancer in his liver which had caused it to swell. Hueyaposs only treatment option was to have eight rounds of chemotherapy over the next seven months.  After his chemotherapy had ended, Huey still had signs of cancer within his liver and around his carotid artery. But, miraculously, Huey continued to recover after the chemotherapy and the cancer cells depleted. Now, Jill says the cancer cells appear to have gone completely. Huey is now four-and-a-half years old and thriving. Jill describes her son as the light of my le. Despite being a happy and healthy boy, he lives with the after-effects of having chemotherapy so young, and has a speech delay. Arguing for newer, more targeted treatment options for children with neuroblastoma Jill said her sonaposs speech delay is getting much better, but he still has some way to go. The family is working with the Childrenaposs Cancer Institute in Australia, which is researching more targeted treatments so young kids arenapost given such intense chemotherapy.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcNow, Jill is raising money to fund research that will improve treatment for neuroblastoma in children - aiming to help future kids diagnosed with the condition and give them a better chance.

Residents near the junction in East London woke up to a loud bang at .am on Sunday. To their horror, they saw the crumpled car outside their window. It is thought the car swerved to avoid oncoming traffic but didnapost quite make the turn. Two people who were inside the car got out, took a look at the front of the car, took a child out from the backseat and then bizarrely walked off. They appeared to be miraculously uninjured as the horrying scenes were caught on a residentaposs home security system.  The camera was pointed at the traffic bollard at the junction of Leyton Green Road and Lea Bridge Road in Leyton. One man and his we were woken by a thunderous bang on Sunday morning. When they saw the crash, they phoned the police and ambulance. By the time authorities arrived the occupants of the silver car had vanished. Footage shows the vehicle swerving to avoid an oncoming back car, and careering into a no through road.  It takes out a road sign and then gets stuck on a bollard. The driver revs the engine, trying to move it, but the car is well and truly stuck. Two people then get out and remove a child from the back seat. Meanwhile, a motorist in a black car parks up to check on the driver and passengers, and when the driver sees the two people walking around their car, he walks off.  A witness said: It looks like they have seen the oncoming cars, and ended up in the cycle lane. The car was embedded on the bollard. They didnapost actually stop for the police or ambulance. It woke me and my we up. I called the emergency services and they were there in a few minutes, but the guys had walked off. There was a minor in the car that can be seen in the video. And he added: There have been more accidents which have taken place in the last few years at that junction. A spokeswoman for the Met Police said: Police were called to Lea Bridge Road, E, shortly after .hrs on Sunday,  November to reports of a road traffic collision. Officers attended. A BMW car was found to have collided with a lamppost and a bollard. The occupants of the vehicle, including a child, had left the scene before police arrived.

Nearly  per cent of Tube drivers are backing a walk out due to anger over possible reductions to their pensions and changes to working conditions put forward by Transport for London . Members of rail union Aslef are now considering taking industrial action over the busy Christmas period. The huge number of tube drivers wanting to go out on strike is as a result of them feeling that the “agreed working conditions” are now being torn up.Finn Brennan, Aslef’s organiser on the Underground, said the vote was extraordinary, reported MyLondon.  He added: Itaposs a staggering mandate from our members that sends a clear message to Transport for London. Government cuts to its funding, together with a fall in passenger numbers since the Covid pandemic, have led to a financial crisis at TfL. Management and government now want to plug that funding gap by slashing staff pensions and tearing up our agreed working conditions. “This ballot result shows that our Tube train drivers aren’t prepared to let them get away with it.” So far no date has been put in place for a strike but Aslef is considering the Christmas period to put more pressure on the TfL. A fresh bailout is being sought by the TfL from central government with further talks on December . The service saw its cash from travel fares dry up during the pandemic - leading to hundreds of millions of pounds in lost revenue. Central government gave the TfL a series of short-term funding deals with conditions including a review of pensions and moves towards driverless trains, reported MyLondon. With no more funding for London transport in the government’s recent Comprehensive Spending Review, it has led to fears of more cuts. London Underground management is currently reviewing “every aspect” of the business, meaning it could be heading towards strikes on the network. Nearly , tube drivers voted in the ballot and just  drivers voted against strike action.Mick Whelan, general secretary of ASLEF, said: “Last year Boris Johnson stood on the steps of Downing Street and applauded essential workers. Now his government wants to cut our pensions and attack our working conditions.”“It’s up to Boris Johnson to step up and do the right thing to help keep the capital moving. Last year, the basic salary for a full time underground driver was £, and there are no plans yet to ballot overground drivers, reported MyLondon. A Transport for London spokesperson said: “This mandate relates to ongoing discussions with our trade unions. We urge ASLEF to continue working with us to resolve these matters without having to resort to industrial action.

Andrew Watts, from Bexley, south London, nearly had his ventilator switched off after he was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with Covid- pneumonia. The -year-old black cab driver fell ill on Christmas Day  and ended up being one of the longest patient stays the hospital in Woolwich has seen. He spent eight months in intensive care and then two months on a ward which adds up to  days in total. In a new interview he has revealed that he was confronted by a conspiracy theorist and some visitors in his hospital ward believed the virus was a aposhoaxapos despite his gruelling ordeal.  Sky News reports that he said he was confronted by one person visiting another patient who told him the virus was all a conspiracy.He said: There were people in the hospital in the ward I was in, who were visiting certain patients, who didnapost believe it. There were people who didnapost believe in the vaccination for a start, then there were people who didnapost believe Covid was real.@ Andrew said he brushed it aside and didnapost want to get into arguments with them.  He added: In the end, I just thought: aposHereaposs the proof -you donapost want to believe it, what can I do apos After a five-week induced coma and a le-threatening lung collapse, Andrewaposs health deteriorated to such an extent that in February, doctors called his family to tell them they were considering turning his ventilator off. Recalling when he first became unwell, Andrew said: A week before Christmas , I started to feel ill. “I wasn’t eating and I was losing weight, but I thought it was just the anxiety getting to me. When I was admitted to hospital with Covid I initially responded well to treatment, but then my oxygen levels started to drop and I was taken for a CT scan. That was when I was told that I had a pneuomothorax, which is a split on the lung. “I was on my own as this was the height of Covid, with no visitors allowed, so it was a lot to take in. By this point I was crying my eyes out, on the phone to my sister Hannah and my we Hayley, but I didn’t want to tell my mum or my dad. I couldn’t bring myself to tell them.” After overcoming a second lung collapse, fortunately, Andrew’s lungs begun to improve and he was able to come off the ventilator in June . Andrew’s family, including his we Hayley and sons Jack, six, and Joshua, three, were able to visit, although he could only communicate by pointing a stick at letters on a board.

It isn’t any old takeaway, as all the food served is plant-based and vegan. The Levenshulme business, JJ’s Vish and Chips, which opened its doors earlier this month, aims to be a plant-based offering for both vegans and meat eaters who want to try something new. It offers vegan fish and chips, as well as vegan bratwurst, sausage and nuggets, so no-one has to feel left out when they’re looking for a takeaway. JJ’s Vish and Chips began serving Manchester in February as a takeaway business, with plans to open a shop when the time was right. Owner Jess Jones, , from Leeds,told our sister site Chill: “It was about two and a half, nearly three years ago now, I was at a fish and chip shop in Leeds, my hometown, and just wanted a takeaway.“I was vegetarian at the time and realised I couldn’t get anything that was vegetarian and a chippy tea. “There were all these sort of things that were coming out like vegan burgers and junk food you could get, but there didn’t seem to be any fish and chip shop replicas.” With that in mind, Ms Jones decided to go out and create her own version of fish and chips that vegetarians and vegans could enjoy.Wondering where to eat, drink or visit for your next UK holiday  At Chill we help you decide where to go and stay next with hundreds of recommendations right on your doorstep.

For the latest must-have travel news follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. She said: “It was just a case of me feeling like I was missing out and I came up with this mad idea.” Ms Jones uses banana blossom to make the vish which is then shaped into fish-shaped patties, marinated in fishy flavours, battered and fried. It took a bit of experimentation to decide on this recipe, but Ms Jones was armed with some culinary knowledge when she first embarked on the venture.  Ms Jones said: “I worked in hospitality for many years and I’ve worked in kitchens, so I enjoy cooking a lot. “So to come up with the recipe it was a mix of my knowledge from working in kitchens, trying things at home, reading online and trial and error really.” Ms Jones opened her first shop in Leeds in  and has received a lot of support from Mancunians since the opening of her new site. She said: “The reaction has been brilliant, since opening our Manchester site it’s been absolutely mental. “We’ve had lots of excited people in the shop and nice stuff online. It’s really nice and positive so far.” Many people choose to eat plant-based food, claiming a vegan or vegetarian diet can help to protect the planet.  Some people are reluctant to make the switch because they don’t want to give up their favourite dishes that contain meat or fish. At JJ’s Vish and Chips, vegans and non-vegans alike enjoy the plant-based recreation of the fish and chips which is important to Ms Jones, as she wants everyone to enjoy her food. She said: “I’ve read a few comments online that have said, ‘Iaposm a meat eater and I can confirm it’s nice’. “I think because there’s been quite a lot of hype it might have encouraged people who might not have tried before to just give it a go which is really important. “I don’t want to just cater to vegans and veggies, I want to cater to everyone and anyone. “If someone can come to the shop and have my chippy tea over a fish chippy tea every now and again then I feel like that’s me doing my bit for the planet.” Comment MORE ON ChillFoodFast foodJunk food\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Sign Up!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

George Linnane, who describes himself on social media as a “petrolhead, scuba er, caver, engineer, snowboarder, DJ, producer, human”, became trapped in the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu caves in the Brecon Beacons, Wales. The rescue lasting more than  hours involved  personnel and was Britainaposs biggest ever cave rescue. To get him out, rescuers had to swim through a swollen underground stream, with George on a floating stretcher, and had to lt him ft through a vertical chasm with the stretcher on ropes. HE couldnapost avoid some good-natured ribbing as he was carried out.  Michael Thomas, a friend and fellow caver who spent  hours underground with George, joked online: “The first thing he got from me… was stick, making me go down bloody dim [water] entrance to reach him.” His mum, Sally Linnane-Hemmens, said the long wait for her son to be brought to the surface had been “horrendous”. Sally, from Titchfield, Hants, set up a fundraiser for the South  Mid-Wales Cave Rescue Team which led the operation. The Times reports that following the rescue a friend said he was experienced, known for being a reliable caver, and aposhard as nails.apos “He doesn’t take risks,” they said. “Throughout the rescue George was very stoic that’s the kind of person he is. He’s got a huge amount of experience in cave exploration and has qualied as an underground er as well.” And friends said he was aposlaughingapos at jokes made via social media about his rescue. His girlfriend, who asked not to be named, was reported to have said she was grateful to the rescuers.  Meanwhile, in an interview with the , Dr Brendan Sloan, a consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care for Mid-Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust who spent hours below ground assisting the caver, called him aposremarkably resilient.aposHe said: “He was conscious for the whole rescue, talking to us, responding to our questions. “He was clearly anxious and keen to get out of there, but he was remarkably resilient and co-operative, which made it a lot easier. It required some very dficult manoeuvring for the stretcher for a very long period and he was in quite a lot of pain throughout.” Dr Sloan, who is also a member of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team, added that he was aposan experienced caver who was simply unluckyapos saying: “It could have happened to any of us.

Sarah Moulds, , was filmed apparently kicking and punching a distressed horse in the street.A clip shared on social media by anti-hunting campaign group Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs shows her being aggressive towards the animal after it ran into a road. The sickening footage quickly caused outrage on social media, with people calling on the RSPCA - the largest animal welfare charity in the UK - to launch an investigation. Today, it has been reported that Ms Moulds is a married teacher and mum who works at Somerby Primary School and is also a director of the Knossington  Somerby Pre-School in Leicestershire. The Daily Star reports that Moulds was listed as a team manager for the local Cottesmore Pony Club but has since been removed from the website following the allegations.The Pony Club has now confirmed that Moulds was never a member and has been removed from her voluntary position.  A spokesperson for the Pony Club said: We are aware of the video circulating showing unacceptable treatment of a pony and we wholeheartedly condemn this behaviour. The welfare of horses and ponies is of the utmost importance to The Pony Club, therefore the lady in question has been removed from her voluntary position as a team organiser for a branch.  The Pony Club is a youth membership organisation and as such, she is not a member of The Pony Club. Cottesmore Hunt, who Moulds is believed to be part of, yesterday told The Mirror: The Chairman and Masters want to make it quite clear that they strongly disapprove of any such actions and assure you that they take a matter such as this very seriously and will deal with it in an appropriate manner.  The Hunting Office also criticised the footage, saying in a statement: The Hunting Office expects the highest level of animal welfare at all times - both on and off the hunting field - and condemns the actions taken by this inidual, who is not a member of the hunting associations. The RSPCA did not confirm the identity of the hunt rider but said in a statement: This footage is really upsetting.  We will always look into complaints made to us about animal welfare. We would urge anyone with first hand information about this incident to contact us on   . Knossington  Somerby Pre-School in Leicestershire declined to comment on the story.

The -year-old, from London, has two long-term relationships and is currently dating three women on a casual basis. “I don’t have a primary relationship where I live with someone,” says Roy, “but I have multiple relationships which I practice in parallel. Along with my partners, we practice lots of transparency and honesty. They know who  I’m dating and we all make sure to practice safe sex - and also to coordinate our calendars.” When it comes to logistics Roy, who began working as a relationship coach last year after a career in digital marketing, says he spends time dferently depending on which partner he’s with.What is your view on polyamory  Have your say in the comment section “One of them doesn’t have any other partners, while the other has a few casual connections. I see one of the women every week to  days and the other I’ll see a few times week. When it comes to the more casual date we’ll go for drinks or just stay the night with each other. As long as everyone knows where they stand then it’s a good approach.” And while Roy, and his two long-term partners, both of whom he has been seeing for around three years, normally live separately, they decided to live together during lockdown. “We were worried about not being able to see each other,” he explains. “It wasn’t easy as we didn’t have much space or privacy and we’re all used to living on our own, but it worked for around six or eight weeks.  The key is to be really aware of what your real needs are in a relationship. The way I see it, I don’t own anyone’s body, mind or emotions. Just because we’re dating they’re not obliged to give me their time or affection. I would spend two nights a week with each one, have a couple of nights to myself and then we’d get together one night to watch a film or something like that. We’re all quite independent and like our own space, so it was nice to get that back later on.”  Roy, who runs website openrelating.love, has been married in the past but thinks it’s unlikely he’ll wed again - because he thinks like Danny Dyer. “For me it didn’t feel right,” he says. “The structures just didn’t work for me and I wasn’t comfortable with the idea there was only this one person I was going to spend time with. I believe some of us have the capacity to love more than one person at a time and for people like that it can feel cruel to have to exclude others they want to connect with.” Comment MORE ON Danny DyerLoveDatingMarriageRelationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The emergency inspection of the house found the resident living alongside a large infestation of rats with no electricity, heating or water. The property was also in such a serious state of disrepair that it could have collapsed at any moment, Nottinghamshire Live reports.Concerned council officers moved the elderly resident into a local care home due to his ill health.  John Wilmott, cabinet member for licensing at Ashfield District Council, said: The owner of the property was vulnerable and living in an awful condition that could have ended his le. The amount of filth in the property was unimaginable, it was truly unbelievable that someone could live that way, but thanks to the work of our officers, he never has to live like that again. The council is committed to supporting vulnerable residents and utilising all available resources to ensure the empty and dangerous homes are made safe and reoccupied.  The environmental health team helped the owner sell his house at auction which has now been renovated into a family home. Last month a frustrated landlord spoke of his experiences with nightmare tenants who left his properties in squalid conditions. The man has been renting out houses for  years and despite building up a successful business, he constantly has to deal with tenants who wreck his homes and live in filth.  The homeowner, who has houses in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, said he once saw a baby crawl through dog poo in one of their flats.On another occasion, he visited a house and found a lawnmower in the living room, Grimsby Live reports.The landlord said he is now on his tenth eviction, which has taken a financial toll on his family. For this reason, they have decided to start selling their houses instead of renting them.

Football loving Campbell Kaplinsky, eight, had been dreaming of going to see Liverpool FC for the first time before his dad bought two tickets for the West Ham game on November . Dad Ben, bought the tickets for his son as a reward for going to bed on time for three weeks and claims he didnapost know they were for the home end until being told by officials.Ben told The ECHO: He was so excited he wanted to arrive at the train station more than  minutes before the train arrived.He woke up at .am full of excitement and spoke about nothing but the match all day.  The dad and son travelled two and a half hours from Brighton to the Olympic Stadium, with Campbell wearing a red Liverpool shirt under his camo jacket. Ben struggled to keep up with his son as he ran excitedly from Stratford Station to the stadium gates. But once outside Gate C officials took the pairaposs tickets away and Campbell was left aposinconsolableapos. His dad said: I could not believe it as the officials disappeared with the tickets and suspected they may have been sold on for personal profit. The poor boy was inconsolable, locked out the stadium as the best day of his le turned into the worst day of his le. As he went to sleep that night sobbing I did my best to comfort him by reminding him of that timeless Liverpool anthem of strength, hope and resilience – aposthough your dreams be tossed and blown at the end of the storm there is a golden sky and you will never walk aloneapos. West Ham says that home match tickets are for the use by West Ham supporters only. Anyone applying for or using home match tickets must be a supporter of West Ham and not a supporter of the visiting club. The club also says that any inidual who enters any part of London Stadium designated for the use of any group of supporters to which they do not belong may be ejected from the ground either for the purposes of their own safety or for any other reason. The club states that any supporter who purchases tickets must acknowledge acceptance of this and all other terms and conditions, including ground regulations.

Other snaps show the couple signing contracts and beaming as they sit between Malalaaposs parents Ziauddin Yousafzai and Toor Pekai Yousafzai. On Twitter she wrote: Today marks a precious day in my le. Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for le.We celebrated a small nikkah ceremony at home in Birmingham with our families. Please send us your prayers. We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead. Just a few months ago in June, Malala dissected the system of marriage for young Pakistani women in an interview with Vogue. I still donapost understand why people have to get married. If you want to have a person in your le, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why canapost it just be a partnership  she said. Her comment was in relation to a conversation she had with her mum, who wanted her to get married because marriage is beautul. Malalaaposs comments sparked outrage, with commenters calling her un-Islamic and a bane to society, Varsity reports. Her queries about the marriage bond even lead to death threats, with one cleric being arrested after saying he would carry out a suicide attack on the young woman when she visits Pakistan, tribune reports.Just months ago in June, the celebrated activist graduated after completing a degree at Oxford University. She posted a series of photos, including one of herself covered in colourful squares and a cream cake. Another showed her family posing with balloons and a large cake reading: Happy graduation Malala. She wrote: Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford.I don’t know what’s ahead. For now, it will be Netflix, reading and sleep.Like many students this year Malala has graduated in unusual circumstances.  Universities across the country have closed to students and non-essential staff, meaning exams could not go ahead as usual. The typically raucous celebrations expected after an intense exam season have also not been able to go ahead, with graduates like Malala having to toast their successes at home instead. The human rights activist came to the worldaposs attention when she was  and a blog she had written about le as a girl in Taliban-controlled Swat Valley caught the eye of journalist Adam B. Ellick. The subsequent New York Times documentary gave Malala a  to speak about the suppression of girlsapos education in the region.

She was transferred to a hospital in Birmingham, UK where she recovered before setting up a le in the country. Malala co-authored the best-selling book aposI am Malalaapos in  and jointly won the  Nobel Peace Prize along with Kailash Satyarthi. Hundreds of people flocked to wish the young woman well upon news of her graduation from Lady Margaret Hall.Astronaut and former USA national rugby player Anne McClain wrote: Congratulations on your graduation @Malala!

But Brandon, from Cheadle Hulme, was the only one out of a party of six told he couldn’t enter the venue which advertises a smart-casual dress code.His sister Paris Osborne has called out the venue on Twitter, saying her brother was the victim of homophobic and discriminatory abuse, reports Manchester Evening News.She said: “Weaposve just been out for my sisteraposs birthday and my brother, who is the best dressed out of all of us and is extremely expressive and proudly gay, was denied entry to @storiesMCR. “The bouncer looked him up and down, said his apospants are too too muchapos, aposthe leopard print, no.apos “But then let a man who was seen as more male who wore jeans that were discoloured, dirty and wore worn out trainers, straight in. “Absolute discrimination and homophobic. This needs to be seriously addressed. DD London, which operates  Stories, apologised to Brandon and said the company operates on a ‘zero-discrimination policy’. But Brandon said he found the bounceraposs comments “infuriating” as he did not see a problem with the way he was dressed. He said: “When we arrived, my sister went into the building and askedthey had a table for six and the bouncer said yes. “When I walked up behind them, he looked me up and down three times and it felt like he was looking at me judgmentally. “The bouncer said everyone  could come in but there was an issue with what I was wearing. My dad asked why and he said what I was wearing was too casual, gesturing towards my pants. “We asked what the dress code was and he said it was smart casual. He said jeans were allowed but what I was wearing was apostoo, too muchapos. “Queer people are suppressed and made to feel dferent our entire lives. I’m personally not a very confident person so the way I present myself with dangly earrings and patterned clothing makes me feel that little bit more confident and happy within myself. “Having autism as well makes it really dficult for me to find ways to express myself and feel comfortable within my own skin, so businesses discriminating against me like this could potentially tear down all of that.” Following Paris’ original post, which has now been shared by hundreds of accounts, Brandon’s sister posted a photo from Instagram showing a number of women tagged at  Stories wearing similar leopard print clothes. “I don’t understand why me wearing leopard print pants doesn’t fit their dress code but they let women with the same print in,” Brandon added.  “It was clearly subconscious homophobia - something which I am used to. “My family were more angry at the situation than I was because I’m used to brushing off situations like this but we shouldn’t have to. “I’m sick of people having this rose-tinted view of the world being so much more equal and better now, but these high-end venues don’t cater to people like me because I’m not their target audience. “We need to get past the idea that male-presenting people wearing what is viewed as “feminine” clothing is detrimental to their reputation. Their policies are the problem.” Brandon, who is studying psychology at university, said the incident will not stop him from dressing the way he does but could have caused real hurt to others. If going out in animal print means that I get denied because it’s too much, then I will just go to a more queer-friendly space without the added toxic masculinity. “But there’s others who are in a fragile state where it could really be detrimental to them and affect their self-worth.” A spokesperson for DD London apologised to Brandon and said the company operates on a ‘zero-discrimination policy’. They said: “We would like to apologise to Brandon, Paris and their party for the upset this incident has caused and that the group were refused entry from  Stories.  “Since opening, we have implemented a dress code policy at  Stories. On this occasion, our door team, reception desk and manager did not believe that the dress code had been adhered to and made the decision to refuse entry. “We operate a zero-discrimination policy at  Stories and across DD London and have been doing a great deal of work to implement this by training and educating our staff across the group. “We have been working with the LGBT Foundation to develop a training programme for all DD employees which is now a standard as part of their ongoing training and development. “Some venues across the group have been trialling this programme, providing feedback to all management via focus groups and webinars ahead of the programme being rolled out to all  venues by the end of December. “Over the last year we have put a number of measures in place to improve awareness and processes and a great deal of work has taken place behind the scenes to ensure  Stories and other DD venues are inclusive for all with management training, our partnership with LGBT Foundation and the donation we have made over the last year to support the incredible work the foundation is doing. “Our external security team has gone through mandatory training in LGBTQ+, Effective Communication, and Mental Health Awareness, in the past year. “We have contacted Paris and her family in order to discuss this incident and we look forward to hearing back from them soon.” In a tweet, Dr Paul Martin OBE, CEO of LGBT Foundation, said: What’s happened to Brandon is disgraceful  @StoriesMCR need to apologise immediately and acknowledge that they got this very wrong. Whilst it’s true @LGBTfdn have begun working with them this incident has clearly highlighted that much more work needs to be done.

The -year-old, who is currently living in her  million mansion in Calornia having stepped back from the royal family, spoke about womenaposs opportunities at work for the aposMinding the Gapapos event. She made the case alongside Mellody Hobson, President of Ariel Investments and the chairwoman of Starbucks Corporation. At one point the mum-of-two turned her attention to social media, suggesting that the current set up encouraged negative debate. The Duchess highlighted the fact that Instagram has a like button and ability to comment, but not a aposdislikeapos option.  As a consequence, people either express their approval by hitting aposlikeapos, or explain their negative feelings in the comments. A aposdislikeapos button would lead to less negative, angry comments, Meghan said. One of the things that seems like such an easy solve from my lens,you look at Instagram for example, thereaposs a like button and then thereaposs comments, she said. Soyou disagree with something you have to comment on it in a really vitriolic way. If there was a dislike button wouldnapost that hugely sht what you were putting out there, because you could just like it or just dislike it. Now you have to like it or say something negative. It is just adding to this really unfortunate cycle that I think is having an unfortunate effect on women across the world. The online session tackled the question: How can women reach economic and professional parity    The Duchess argued that pushing for paid parity between the sexes was a positive thing both for workers and for companies, while also renewing her calls for paid sick and parental leave in the US. Earlier this month, the Duchess penned an impassioned plea to senior congress members on the topic. In the letter, she argued that a national paid-leave mandate would not only help inidual families, but the country as a whole. In taking care of your child, you take care of your community, and you take care of your country—because when paid leave is a right, we’re creating a foundation that helps address mental health outcomes, health care costs, and economic strength at the starting line, Meghan wrote.  Paid leave should be a national right, rather than a patchwork option limited to those whose employers have policies in place, or those who live in one of the few states where a leave program exists. … This is about putting families above politics. When she was asked about advocating for the change during the summit this evening, Meghan said she was not involving herself in politics as she considered the issue a cross-party, humanitarian one. The Duchess went on to relate the issue of womenaposs rights in the workplace to her own experience as a child. She spoke about how her experience attempting to save and make money when she was younger has taught her lessons that remain with her today, despite her now sizeable wealth. When she admitted being an avid couponer in her younger years, Meghan was asked whether she keeps up the practice today. Do they have coupons anymore, I donapost know. I will never buy something online without finding an online promo code first, the Duchess said, arguing that values learned as a child can stay with a person for le.  If that was engrained with me when I was young, imagine what the world would be likeyou ingrained other elements of financial understanding, especially in young women, so they could move in the world in a dferent way. Meghan went on to tell how she used to make scrunchies out of scraps of fabric to sell as a child. It was that feeling, I had done something myself, she said of the sensation sheaposd get after selling some of her crafts. You get not just purpose, but a sense of self satisfaction. Meghan also expressed her hopes for the future of work post-Covid, arguing for a hybrid model of working from home and in the flesh for those who can.

The Duchess of Sussex discussed a range of issues in her first in-person interview since she and Prince Harryaposs tell all on the Oprah Winfrey show in March. Speaking to host Andrew Ross Sorkin tonight, she said stepping back from royal duties has lead to an improvement in her mental health. Mr Sorkin said there was a moment when a lot of the world was concerned and wondering about the comments she made. The Duchess replied: Iaposm feeling much better about everything, thank you.  In addition to her own mental health, the ex royal spoke of having to cut out coupons as a youngster, her time working as a waitress and her recent controversial letters to Republican Senators on the issue of paid parental leave. Meghan, clad in an all-black outfit, wore a Remembrance poppy as she was questioned for the New York Timesapos DealBook summit. During Prince Harry and Meghanaposs tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey, which aired on ITV on March , the couple made a series of bombshell revelations about their lives with other royals.During the show - which was broadcast to .million viewers - Meghan claimed there were concerns over their son Archieaposs skin colour. She also claimed that she was denied help from the Royal Family during her private struggle with her suicidal thoughts.Harry also claimed that his father and brother, Prince Charles and William, are trapped in the institution of the monarchy.  And just days ago a royal biographer revealed the interview was planned years in advance. The Sussexesapos rt with the Royal Family led to them moving to the United States last year and since then they have spoken regularly to American media about problems they allege forced them to leave. Allegations or rumours of a dficult relationship between Meghan and other royals were widespread and the relationship deteriorated after their marriage in . While the Sussexes have given regular interviews to the media about their problems with the Royal Family, the one with most impact was made with Oprah earlier this year where Harry said he had to break the cycle and bring his children up in a dferent environment. He was critical of the family while Meghan also alleged a racist incident with a royal who had questioned what colour would be the skin of her child when she was pregnant for the first time.  Now royal biographer Andrew Morton has said that the interview with Oprah was being discussed after Harry and Meghan tied the knot in . In his research for his new book “Meghan and the Unmasking of the Monarchy” he said he was astonished to find that negotiations were underway between Harry and Oprah just six months after they got married.“They were planning the big Oprah interview several years before it actually happened,” he told CTV’s Your Morning.Morton said in the book that he expected the couple to leave the UK for another country for the sake of their marriage as Meghan wasn’t prepared to take any more. “For Harry, it was either Meghan, or the monarchy,” he said in the book.

I had my mum take me downtown to get scraps of fabric from the fabric stores and sell them like five for five bucks who knows.” Meghan said that she can recall the “pride” from making the scrunchies. “I remember the feeling of knowing that I had done something, I had invested in myself and done this labour and been compensated for it.

Wenjing Lin, , was murdered by Chun Xu, , at the takeaway in Ynyswen, Rhondda Cynon Taf, where she lived in with her mother, Meang Xu, and stepfather Yongquan Jiang.Xu had admitted manslaughter but denied murder, but was found guilty of the murder of Miss Linn and the attempted murder of Mr Jiang. Ms Xu has described the horrendous moment she found Miss Lin shortly after the killing on March . She told the court: The moment I saw her face had gone black and pale. I went to hug her and her body was cold. I could see her neck was black as she had been strangled.  Speaking outside the court with the support of her husband, Ms Xu said her daughter had passed all her GCSEaposs with As but died before getting the results. She said: My beautul daughter is gone and I can never forgive you. I have lost my beloved daughter, my everything. Everything of me. She cared for my husband and I very much. She has been helping us to communicate with all the English speakers.school friends miss her so much, I know they are suffering from the pain and loss of their best friend. They will never recover from it. Before that horrible day she was a very, very happy girl. She loved spending time with her friends and she enjoyed school.  Weaposve been to the school to speak to them. My daughter has passed all her GCSEaposs with As but she will never know her results that she has worked so hard for. Iaposm so proud of her achievements in the school. She loved school so much and her teachers called her the model student. Iaposm still not able to comprehend why the perpetrator would do this to her. Our lives have been turned upside down. I was crying every day, watching videos every day and trying to feel close to her and listen to her voice. I cannot imagine what my le is like without her. She was my only child. The perpetrator has broken our family. I had to begin counselling to help me but it will never take away the pain the perpetrator has caused us.  Miss Lin was described as an exceptional student by her teacher Rhiannon Davies who had a statement read to the court during the trial. Ms Davies, who taught Wenjingaposs when she was in year  at Treorchy Comprehensive School, said she was hardworking student. Even on the day of her death I was made aware she had logged in for a maths lesson early in the morning, Ms Davies added. She was a fantastic student and is sorely missed. The trial heard how Xu was a heavy gambler and owed the family £,. Michael Jones QC, prosecuting, told the court Xu visited the family armed with a kitchen kne, and an hour before the attacks had Googled can fingerprints be destroyed by fire.  When he was later questioned by a psychologist about his fitness to be questioned by police, he said: I didnapost mean to hurt the little girl. I wanted revenge on her mother. She upset me on many times and didnapost listen to what I say. Xu, also known as Little Gang, was regarded as a nephew to the mother, Ms Xu, as their parents had lived next door to each other in China, but they were not blood relations, Mr Jones said. In December , the family entrusted Xu with £, that he said he would send back to China for them to pay a friend who had loaned them money to start their business in the UK. However, Xu only sent some of the money back and gambled away £,, which he had then begun paying back. On March , , he rang Ms Xu and askedhe could come to see them, but told her not to tell anyone about his visit. That night they ate food together and everyone went to bed. The next morning, Mr Jones said, he strangled to death -year-old Wenjing. An hour before the attack he is said to have Googled dferent iations of whether finger prints on kne will still existburnt by fire. After killing Wenjing, Xu is said to have lured her stepfather, Mr Jiang, into the basement by asking whether he could have a piece of fish from the freezer. In the basement, Xu began attacking Mr Jiang with two knives, stabbing him in the neck and body.  When Mr Jiang asked Xu why he was attacking him, Xu replied: Money, money, money. Ms Xu then came down the basement stairs and saw the two fighting. She tried to ring a friend, and Xu bit her. Mr Jiang fought Xu off and went upstairs to find his stepdaughter, Wenjing. He discovered her lying on her back by the takeaway counter. Despite attempts by the family and then paramedics to resuscitate the teenager, she was pronounced dead at the scene at .pm. Police found Xu in the kitchen, having cut his own throat. He was treated at University Hospital of Wales before being arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Xu admitted attacking -year-old Mr Jiang, but denied intending to kill him or cause him serious harm. He will be sentenced on Friday at the same court.

She said: “We were getting eye infections, ear infections, skin infections and we were constantly going to the doctors and getting prescribed medication. “It got so bad that we would only sleep there, as soon as we woke up in the morning we would run out of the house because we knew it was making us sick and we would come back only to sleep because we had nowhere  to go. “We moved our beds around every room of the house because it was spreading. “Then what I think was fungus started growing and I’ve never seen anything like it in my le. “We used to have to sit and eat with this fungus above us dropping onto us. In the bathroom there was a leak from the extractor fan which meant we couldn’t use the toilet and I’ll be honest with you, we had to go to the toilet in the bath sometimes because it was that bad.” Georgeianna said she complained but the issue wasn’t dealt with properly and claims the mould was scraped back and and painted over. Environmental Health visited the property in November , and issued a Section  to the housing association, identying the property had signicant disrepair and was hazardous to live in. Georgeianna moved into shared accommodation and was then moved a number of times from hotels to flats. After a year of moving around, Catalyst offered her a permanent home to move into but when she went to view the property she claimed she could smell mould, sewage and feared that she would be in the same situation that she had been in previously. She said: Night after night I had no idea where I was going to sleep and I’ve got a nine-year-old daughter who’s caught up in all of this as well.” Georgieanna claims sheaposs been moved over ten times since she was made homeless in . She said: “I’m now being told I need to go back to the property that I was living in in , that made me and my daughter severely ill and I can’t do it, it’s caused me so much trauma and mental health issues. “I don’t want to be in this situation, I just want to live in a property that doesn’t have mould and isn’t going to make me and my daughter ill. “All the properties I’ve been shown are not habitable, I can smell it when I walk in. “It’s heartbreaking, I’ve called my mum and said I can’t do this anymore. Itaposs destroying me and I have no motivation for anything.” The spokesperson said that all accommodation provided by Richmond Council has to meet the Housing Health and Safety Rating System.  A spokesperson from Richmond Council said: Richmond Council has been engaging with this resident and their concern regarding their accommodation. The resident has been provided with temporary accommodation in the borough, but has advised that it is unsuitable and is not living there. The Council has placed the resident in hotel accommodation and is working proactively with the resident to get them out of hotel accommodation and into suitable, alternative temporary accommodation. The case worker met with the resident on November  and we hope to meet a solution soon.A spokesperson for Catalyst said: “Our customers should expect and deserve great customer service and we act as quickly as possible when it comes to damp, mould and other repairs issues but in order to fix them, customers must give us access to do so.“When we attempted to fix the reported issues by Ms Matta she refused to let us into the home or engage with us, forcing us to get a court order to access the property. The repairs were eventually completed over a year ago once we were able to gain access. “Ms Matta is not living in this property so we are attempting to take possession of it to offer it to another family in housing need.” Comment MORE ON TravelodgeCustomer serviceMental healthHomelessness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The woman, living in Erith, south east London, with her three children, said her family was living in inhumane conditions. She criticised Bexley Council after urgent building work to fix the chimney stack in her home meant scaffolding was used to replace the roof in September. The repairs also affected the plumbing system in the property, so the family had to use a bucket instead of the toilet.The mum also claimed the property was infested with mice, My London reports.Do you have a nightmare housing story  Email webnews@mirror  She said her family felt cold and her children were always in tears, but she refused an alternative offer of a hostel because of safety fears. Pictures of the home show scaffolding and plastic sheets were used in place of the removed roof. The work had to be carried out urgently after surveyors discovered a structural issue caused by dry rot. She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: The flat was in a state of disrepair and there was no end of problems. My youngest daughter used to just cry. She really didnapost like it. It was not liveable. Everything was water damaged. Itaposs an absolute state. The wind was just blowing through, they didnapost secure the plastic, so it was completely open. She added: This was a multi-agency failure. And the fact that in this day children could be treated in this way is actually disgusting. The fact that my children had to go through what they went through is horrendous. Her three children, all aged eight and under, have since spent time with relatives outside the capital, but she says the ordeal has disrupted their schooling and affected their behaviour. She has since moved after opposition councillors stepped in, but said the issue left her unable to explain to her children why their home was so bad. The mum said: To be honest, I thought aposhow has it come to this apos My kids were crying and I had no answers for them. I canapost even give them their basic needs in le and itaposs an absolutely horrendous feeling. And going to the toilet in a bucket was just inhumane. She is set toto the property later this month once repairs are finished. Labour councillor Nicola Taylor, who became directly involved in the case after Mary visited her constituency office, said: I was shocked when I saw the state of this property and knew we had to get the family to a place of safety immediately. As I have become more involved in this case, I have serious concerns over the quality of these properties andthey are fit for our residents. I have still been unable to obtain surveyor or maintenance reports so I wondercouncil taxpayersapos money is being spent appropriately. Bexley Council said in a statement sent to The Mirror: The welfare of people we place in temporary accommodation is a priority for us and we work hard to ensure their safety. The extent of the repairs to this property only became evident following a leak, inspection by our staff and after a ceiling was removed. We identied the work that would be needed and offered the family alternative accommodation while it was carried out. They have a right to their privacy and we are not prepared to publicly share further details of their case.

But EastEnders star Danny Dyer - being Danny Dyer - said it aloud last week. He reckons it’s cruel to have sex with just one person forever. So the hardman actor, who is married to his childhood sweetheart Jo Mas, will be green with envy at the lestyle of husband and we Paulina and Daniel Tenner. They’ve been married for eight years... and almost four years ago decided to “open” their marriage and have sex with other people. “If someone had asked me about this a few years back I’d never have thought I’d do it,” says Paulina, . “But that all changed as a result of some workshops I did about relationships, and I realised my sexual le force was blossoming.” It was then the entrepreneur and husband Daniel, , started talking about how an open marriage might work for them.What is your view on open marriages  Have your say in the comment section “For years we’d been monogamous,” says Paulina, who lives with Daniel in London. “But suddenly I was feeling attracted to dferent men, dferent women, everyone. In the early days of discussions, I may have been the driving force for this, but Daniel definitely needed to be on board - and he was. I wouldn’t have done it without us both feeling the same way.” After long discussions with her husband, Paulina started off at parties with other women that allowed her to “explore her bi-curious fantasies” while Daniel also started seeing other women. He says: “We had talked a lot before we made our decision, and we’d come to the same conclusion. Part of the purpose of le is to really feel that you’re alive and to explore all the interesting things in the world. One of the most fascinating things is the relationships we have with other people. To cut off any of these avenues means you’re sacricing an important part of your le, a part you could derive a huge amount of joy from. “That’s why the comments from Danny Dyer really resonate, because you’re cutting things off, you’re cutting off amazing things that you might have discovered through a connectionyou don’t explore it.”  Over two years the couple each had a series of lovers. Paulina connected with both men and women, and Daniel just dated women. Paulina thinks she had around  partners, while Daniel says he’s not interested in keeping count. “To me, counting lovers is a feature of monogamous le, when there’s pressure, especially on men, to have this sort of ego boost from having a large number of lovers,” he says. “It isn’t something I’m interested in.” The pair spent one New Year’s Eve together with their separate partners - Paulina with her Norwegian boyfriend, while Daniel came along with the British woman he was seeing at the time. “We felt like a big, polyamorous family,” says Paulina. “It was so natural and normal. I was with my lover, and Daniel was with the woman he was seeing at the time, a lady I was good friends with. It was lovely, flowing and natural.”  On seeing her husband with another partner Paulina says: “There was no jealousy. In fact there was satisfaction that he was experiencing something new and interesting. We have no secrets and our relationship is wonderfully transparent.” Daniel agrees jealousy is not a factor. “The idea Paulina is have a wonderful experience with someone  does not create jealousy,” he says. “Jealousy is a term that lumps together a bunch of other things, usually the fear of losing the other person and an envy of what they’ve got. But I haven’t felt a fear of losing Paulina to her other lovers, and I was being nourished and getting what I wanted too, so envy didn’t arise either.” Paulina, who has written a book after training in burlesque dancing, Laid Bare: What the Business Leader Learnt From the Stripper, says she built some deep connections with other partners, particularly the Norwegian man she dated for around two years in parallel with her marriage. She says while maintaining more than one relationship at a time might sound like a lot of effort, the newness of having dferent partners is “exciting”. “I actually think online dating sounds way more exhausting,” she laughs. “Just sex with no emotions is not very interesting to me,” adds Paulina. “Of course I get that people want to want to have just have sex, and that’s fine, but for Daniel and I, we’re looking for more depth. OK, it won’t be as deep a connection as we have with each other, but it needs to be more than just friends with benefits. There has to be a real connection for the sex to be worth it.”  Daniel says having other lovers actually brought him closer to his we. “Encounters with other people have been enjoyable,” he says. “But they also made me realise, even as the connections grew deeper with some women, they led me back to my we.” And while the couple enjoyed their two years in an open relationship, just before the lockdown was announced in early  they decided to suspend the open nature of their marriage - although at the minute they are considering opening it up once again. Pauline says: “At the minute we’re just together but it’s something we might come back to as it gave us so much joy and pleasure, as long as we protect the space for ourselves too.” Daniel adds: “I might be a step further towards opening up again than Paulina is. I don’t want to get to the end of my le and think I had all these opportunities to explore connections and didn’t take them.” The couple, who have been attending couples therapy for more than a year, are considering having children in the future. They have not yet decidedthey would follow the open marriage model while having a family, although Daniel thinks this would offer an open-minded and healthy example to any children. Paulina adds: “We think so many people would be happierthey knew polyamory was a valid option for them. We think there would be less cheating and fewer hearts would be brokenother couples were open about wanting about to make other connections in their le and decided to follow those connections with openness and honesty.”Laid Bare: What The Business Leader Learnt From the Stripper, by Paulina Tenner is out on November .

NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Radio  thatdone right, the decision could drive take-up of the vaccines up .Here’s who be will impacted by the move to make vaccines mandatory. Who will the mandatory vaccination rule apply to  Frontline staff usually means staff that work directly with the public, rather than behind closed doors or in a support capacity.  This would include:doctors nurses midwives paramedics pharmacists social workers and care workersThe only people exempt from the mandatory policy will be those who do not have to face contact with patients and those who have a medical exemption. How many NHS workers do not have the jab  While care groups have been calling for the mandatory vaccine policy to be axed or delayed so providers can get through winter challenges without more staff leaving, the rule that they have to be immunised by this Friday or risk losing their job has seen many care workers who initially refused the vaccine, take the immunisation.  The health minister believes that, while some NHS staff may leave, making jabs mandatory will drive up vaccination rates by prompting those who have been refusing to finally get vaccinated in the same way that has already occurred with care home staff. According to latest NHS figures, almost a quarter of the care home staff were not recorded as having been double jabbed as of October , which means they might lose their jobs this week. Three-quarters of staff working in other social care settings outside of care homes, including non-registered providers and those employed by local authorities, have had their first jab. But only a third of them were doubled jabbed, with many having self-certied as exempt or applied for official proof.

While parts of the country has been hit with showers, floods and gales over the past couple of weeks, temperatures have remained mild and it even reached the unseasonal C in Flinshire on Monday.But after more wind and rain from the remnants of Tropical Storm Wanda, the Met Office has said that freezing temperatures are around the corner - starting on November  with a signicant drop in the mercury and snowfall across the UK.Bookies have slashed the odds on this being the coldest November ever, from - to just -. Weather maps are showing the risk of snow will grow next week. On Wednesday, November , there is a high possibility of snow in Scotland and then over the following day it is likely to hit the North East of England. Then the risk of snow grows down the eastern side of the UK before the map on November  suggests most of the UK will have a very high chance of snow. The worst affected will be Scotland, northern England and the Midlands. Temperatures will have nose ed to as low as -C in parts of Scotland and could be around -C in southern England on November . It is predicted to get even colder going down to -C in southern England and -C in northern Scotland in the early hours of November . We are headed for a big November freeze, Coralaposs Harry Aitkenhead told The Sun.Itaposs left us with no choice but to signicantly slash the odds on this month entering the record books as the coldest eleventh month of the year the UK has ever seen. The Met Office said that there is likely to be a drop in temperatures at the start of next week and then again at the end of the month. It stated: “Remaining changeable and autumnal particularly to the north through the start of this period as low-pressure systems dominate, sometimes accompanied by rain and strong winds. Elsewhere while rain is possible at times, drier and brighter conditions are more likely in the south and southeast regions, although some rain will likely reach even here at times. A rather cold start to the period will likely be followed by a brief recovery in temperatures, before a further likely trend down later on in the month. Later on in the month there will also be an increasing chance of some wintry conditions, mainly over the higher ground in the north, but with a slight risk to lower levels.  Today: A few bright spells in south-east England,  central and southern areas cloudy with outbreaks of rain and drizzle and a good deal of hill fog. Northern areas having sunny spells and some showers, most in the far north. Tonight: Low cloud, mist and fog across central and southern areas with some drizzle. Clear periods further north with patchy frost and fog, but heavy showers and gales in far north. Thursday: Low cloud lting slowly, with some fog persisting until early afternoon over eastern England, then sunny spells. Showers in the north, then rain and strong winds into the northwest later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Breezy with outbreaks of rain on Friday, heaviest in the northwest. Over the weekend, cloudy in the east with some drizzle, brighter in the west. Mild, turning colder later.

The company, who are based in Leicester, has said that the shortage could last to the end of the month with current stock already in short supply. It is understood the midlands factory is producing fewer packets than usual due to the glitch.  A spokesperson for the potato packaging powerhouse said: A recent IT system upgrade has disrupted the supply of some of our products.

The “friend” who thinks knowing us insulates them from the charge of racism when they are being just that. Ex-England cricketer Gary Ballance admitted in a statement last week he’d called Yorkshire teammate, Azeem Rafiq, a “P***” – but said it was done “in the spirit of friendly banter” . Ballance has come clean because, in August , Rafiq gave an interview in which he spoke about the racism he experienced at Yorkshire, including an “openly racist” captain and a dressing room in which racist comments were seen as humorous. The club effectively stuck its head in the sand, but an independent report has blown the whole thing wide open. Sponsors have withdrawn their cash, chairman Roger Hutton has resigned and English cricket’s most successful county has been banned from hosting internationals.  But back to Ballance. He claims to be incredulous that calling an Asian person the P-word could cause the kind of hurt and anguish it did to Rafiq. “If I’d believed it, I would have stopped immediately,” said Ballance. “He was my best cricket mate and I cared deeply for him.” Just not enough to stop using this horrendous racist slur against him. It is easy to believe this is a story just about Yorkshire, cricket or even sport. It isn’t. Go into any office, factory, shop floor or football club you like and you’ll find at least one dinosaur convinced that racist abuse can be used as a term of affection. ‘Can a racist term ever be defined as banter ’ trilled the Twitter account of the BBC’s Question Time. Yes, really. It may as well have asked whether slapping your partner is ever justied. Or whether political corruption is ever justiedthe money is for a good cause.  If ever we needed a snapshot of the institutional racism that infects this country to its core, the past week has provided it. Ironically, there is more outrage and anger directed at those who call it out - as Rafiq has found to his cost - than at the issue itself. Yet the fact remains, across any number of industries and sports, iniduals like him iniably find themselves one of the only Black or Asian people in the room at the mercy of the bigots. Across the country you’ll find iniduals pulling the emergency ripcord defence that their workmate, best friend, neighbour, partner, even husband or we is black. Asthat allows them a free pass to use the kind of language or go down the routes that would otherwise see them vilied. The Government does it even now. Prime Minister Boris Johnson surrounds himself with gatekeepers such as Kwasi Kwarteng, Kemi Badenoch and Priti Patel, believing it protects him from stick for describing Burqa-wearing women as looking like letterboxes. Or describing black people as ‘picaninnies’. Question Time is no exception. Presumably pointing to whatever black or Asian members it has on its production team. And no, it is no defence that the offensive question tweeted was one posed by an audience member to spark debate. Rafiq’s forthcoming appearance in front of a parliamentary select committee may well bring the rest of Yorkshire’s house of cards down. But the shock waves are already reverberating way beyond cricket. PS: You’re not someone’s friendyou’re using racist language towards them.

The US border re-opened to British travellers for the first time in  days or nearly  months. One traveller took to social media to share a video of long lines and blasting officials for disgraceful planning. It showed long queues snaking around the arrivals hall as hundreds wait to be let into the US. America is expecting a flood of international visitors crossing its borders by air and by land on Monday after lting travel restrictions for much of the worldaposs population first imposed in early  to address the spread of Covid-.  More than , passengers flew from London to New York City yesterday. British Airways took , travellers on  planes while Virgin Atlantic brought a further , customers on  flights shuttles into JFK.One Twitter user shared a video of the backlog of traffic and blamed three planes landing at once.He wrote:  months closed lots of time to get things right and JFK Airport queues are a disgrace, three planes landing at the same time from Manchester is ridiculous.  Asked how long he had been waiting, he added: Two hours mate, pathetic. We were all sweating. Just approaching Manhattan now. Paul Richards, , who is head of safeguarding for Stoke City FC, also said he waited two hours after his Virgin Atlantic flight from London.He told USA Today : No point in getting irate, the queue will still be there. Policeman Marc Evans, , who flew from Manchester, with his we and two children said he waited more than an hour. He said: It was apparently a PR stunt to show the USA was back open but seems they werenapost concerned about the queues at customs. Another wrote on Twitter: Great. Queues are JFK are bad enough without two planes touching down at the same time. Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian had earlier said: Itaposs going to be a bit sloppy at first. I can assure you, there will be lines, unfortunately. He added: Weaposll get it sorted out. Heathrow Airport also received numerous complaints on social media for long queues. One wrote on Twitter: Beside myself with appalling service of @BritishAirwaysT trying to get my lovely mum on a flight! @HeathrowAirport waiting  hours now! for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.She added: Sheaposs gone through security. But we are both in tears… this is not a good experience! Another wrote: @HeathrowAirport someone needs to inform your airport assistance personnel that a long connection is nice license to leave a customer sitting and waiting. Yesterday was an emotional day for many as Britons were reunited with friends and family for the first time in  months. Heartwarming images showed couples and families embracing for the first time in nearly two years. Currently, Brits need to be fully vaccinated against Covidthey want to visit the US for non-essential reasons, such as a holiday. Youaposll need to be able to show proof of full vaccination such as the AstraZeneca, BIBP Sinopharm, Covishield, Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. Youaposll also need to show proof of a negative Covid PCR test result taken within  hours before departure, and face masks are mandatory in planes travelling into within out of the USA, as well as airports. Children under  are exempt from the vaccine requirements, but they will need to take a test within - days of arrival .Travel rules are correct at the time of writing but can change quickly during the pandemic, so before planning a trip make sure to always check the Foreign Officeaposs latest USA travel advice.

Isabella Faith Tichenor was picked on by other children as she had autism and dyslexia, said her mum Brittany, while her grandad Gregory also claimed racism was involved. The Tichenor family has said that they want to speak out to raise awareness of bullying and suicide among children following the tragedy. Mum Brittany also alleged that the abuse was reported to the school in North Salt Lake, Utah, but nothing was done to protect her daughter. “As any parent would, we reported this abuse to her teachers, the school administration, and the district administration, she told a press conference.  “Nothing, nothing was done to protect Izzy. Children did not have their behaviour corrected so the torment of this child continued day after day.” But still she was not aware to the extent that the youngster was troubled by the bullying. “You really wouldn’t have known she was going through that,” she said. “So that was the hardest part. She must have really internalised this.” The schoolgirl’s grandmother Paula Harris said that her family will now be her “voice” to tackle the problem of bullying. She said: “We are going to be Izzy’s voice, we are going to ring the bell as loud as we can because we are going to stop this bullying. That little girl had spark, that little girl had hopes and dreams.”  The Tichenor family were joined at the press conference by Foxboro Elementary School PTA representatives who also wanted the problem of bullying addressed. Parent Breanna Larson told News: Everyone has a role here in this failure, and everyone has a role in the solution. It is on the parents, it’s on the students, it’s on the teachers, it’s on the administration. Grandad Gregory Tichenor told the Sun: My daughter went to the teacher and she went to the principal and nothing was done. This has been going on for months and nothing was done. It was both verbal and physical. He claimed that Isabella had been racially abused including the use of the N word. We think this was racially motivated. This is what they do. This is their make up but it needs to change, he alleged. The family said Isabella was found hanged. The local Davis School District said it was investigating the bullying claims. It gave a statement to News: We, like everyone, are devastated by the death of this child.Our hearts go out to the family. Foxboro Elementary has worked extensively with the family and will continue to provide help to them and others impacted by this tragedy.We take all incidents and reports of bullying seriously. At this point, the incident we are aware of involved another student. The teacher and administration responded quickly and appropriately. As with all allegations of bullying, our investigation will continue.A Stand for Izzy GoFundMe page has been set up here. The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

Speaking to host Andrew Ross Sorkin, she said stepping back from royal duties has lead to an improvement in her mental health. Mr Sorkin said there was a moment when a lot of the world was concerned and wondering about the comments she made. The Duchess replied: Iaposm feeling much better about everything, thank you.  She also addressed accusations she had used her royal title to call for paid maternity leave, with royal courtiers branding her interventions as aposoutrageousapos. She said: I donapost see this as a political issue frankly. There is a precedent among my husbandaposs family, the royal family, of not having any involvement in politics. From my standpoint, this is a humanitarian issue. My husband has always said with great privilege comes great responsibility and before I had any kind of privilege, I always stood up for what was right. Iaposve been gone from the US for a really long time, I was in Canada for seven years then I went to the UK. Iaposve come back and Iaposm a mother of two. The US is one of only six countries in the world that didnapost offer any kind of paid national level. I said aposlet me put pen to paper and make some callsapos. To me it seems like a really logical and obvious thing to do.  She added that lawmakers were often apossurprisedapos to hear from her but were receptive. She said: I still see myself as the same as I have always been. Iaposve always been a hard worker, people that know me well some of whom are here today know that, Iaposve just always been the same. Elsewhere in the interview the ex-royal spoke of having to cut out coupons as a youngster, her time working as a waitress. Meghan, clad in an all-black outfit, wore a Remembrance poppy as she was questioned for the New York Timesapos DealBook summit.She also spoke about social media and highlighted the fact that Instagram has a like button and ability to comment, but not a aposdislikeapos option.As a consequence, people either express their approval by hitting aposlikeapos, or explain their negative feelings in the comments. A aposdislikeapos button would lead to less negative, angry comments, Meghan said.

Javier has become a bit of a hit on TikTok where he uploads videos as @unicosobreviviente, which translates to aposonly survivorapos, but heaposs not without his haters.He claims to be stuck alone in the future as the rest of the earthaposs population has been wiped out by a disaster, and he uploads videos of the Spanish city he is in as proof. But some say that heaposs filming deserted parts or visiting areas at quiet times of day, so the TikToker has now uploaded footage of a busy city junction - which is eerily deserted. In the past, Javier has shared footage of a secret passageway in the abandoned city, and clips from a shopping area thataposs become a ghost town - but was recently challenged by a follower on social media. They asked him to upload a clip with a view, which he did, then they asked him to upload the same clip but filmed in the daytime - saying they would believe himthat too made the city look empty. So Javier did so, and in this clip, the roads of the city look completely empty - but TikTok users were still quick to pick the footage part. One said: Look closely at the dark spots in the intersection you can see some movements. Looks like something was edited out.

After listening to more of the messages, the -year-old TikToker realised the messages werenapost from a stalker, and they were in fact from a woman who had lost her husband and was leaving messages for her deceased partner on his old number. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Youaposre just trying to clear your voicemails and notice a number you donapost recognise in blocked numbers ... that has been leaving you voicemails since July , , the TikToker wrote alongside a clip of herself crying. All the voicemails consist of aposI miss youapos and and aposI hope youaposre okayapos and long pauses and what sounds to be soft crying  The -year-old then shared a screengrab from her phone, showing all the messages sheaposd been receiving, sometimes having four missed voicemails per day from the grieving lady. She quietly played one of the messages out loud, in which the woman can be heard saying: Itaposs just me, youaposve been on my mind. Iaposll catch you later, bye. The TikTok user continued: Then you realise itaposs this old lady leaving voicemails to her [late] husband... In the comments section, the TikToker asked for advice on whether she should call the lady or just continue allowing her to leave the messages, and she later concluded that she would leave the woman to it, as many suggested it was probably a much-needed coping mechanism for her. Many people also commented to say they have similar coping mechanisms, and regularly leave messages for loved ones who have passed away.

The footage confirms experts fears of the rapid change in the Earth’s climate due to human activity, with ice melts occurring more during winter seasons than just summer seasons. The timelapse, captured by Dr Kieran Baxter, a lecturer in Communication Design at the University of Dundee’s Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art  Design, showed the melting of the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier Vatnajökull National Park in the south-east of the country. Dr Baxter, with the help of colleagues at the University of Icelandaposs Research Centre, had recorded the footage to show the alarming speed at which centuries-old glaciers are melting.  Dr Baxter said: Footage like this should act as a wake-up call that we cannot ignore the signs any longer. Climate change is already having dire consequences around the world and we have to take responsibility for that. Sadly, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, one of Europeaposs largest ice caps, the Vatnajökull, has been melting since , losing - km of ice and reducing its area by more than  km.  Sadly this is not the first time Dr Baxter has captured the melting of glaciers with aerial photographs of the disappearance of Icelandaposs largest glaciers and ice loss around Mont Blanc in the French and Italian Alps. Glaciologist at the South East Iceland Nature Research Centre, Sn r Gu mundsson, stated how the destruction of the glaciers have acceded any chances of recovery with over  metres of ice recorded to be lost per year.  Dr or ur rnason, who leads the collaborative project at the University of Iceland, said: Where our previous co-production, After Ice, involved re-creating the recent past of glacier melt in Iceland, the new project looks into the future - or rather a range of potential futures that depend on action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions today. This project involves close cooperation between artists and scientists in Scotland and Iceland. We have found this interdisciplinary work to be vital to successful climate change communication.Comment MORE ON University of IcelandClimate change\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The eatery opens at am, but Maura Estafeliz has set up everything an hour before her sht.She first turns on all the machines including the fryer, boilers, heaters, ice cream machines and computers. The employee records the time before filling up the ice cream machine with milk and prepares the drink station. She tells how she fills all the soft drinks before making fresh coffee and tea. Maura then pours a bag of ground coffee into the machine and lets it brew.  Meanwhile, she grabs a bucket of ice to fill up the iced coffee and iced tea machines. She pours the hot coffee into a ice-filled plastic bag to cool down and starts making tea with another tray.. The worker than has to do some computer work where she prints out all the inventory lists and ticks boxes on the menu checklists ensure the restaurant is ready to open. Her tasks continue marking expiry dates for ingredients such as creamer, coffee and eggs.The Daily Star reports that she can then say: All done, after placing printed out labels where they are needed.Some people thought they were watching a complete McDonaldaposs video, but others were horried by the colour of the oil in the fryer and asked when it was last changed. The publication reported one person asking questions about the oil in the frier. The Daily Star reports he said: How is no one talking about the oil there  It looks like itaposs been there since apos. Training completed, when do I start  a second wrote. And a third person added: This is a lot of damn work for a minimum wage. Maura told her viewers she had followed the health and safety procedures evenshe was not filmed wearing gloves. She added: We always change oil on Mondays and theyaposre going to change it tomorrow Weaposre not required to wear gloves just because I didnapost record myself washing my hands and disinfecting things doesnapost mean I didnapost do it.

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

It was the lockdown which entrenched this: screens were the way to connect with people, friends, family and even school learning.They became the default activity and I believe itrsquos become an unhealthy addiction for us and as the nights have drawn in, with less opportunity for outside activity and walks in nature, this addiction has the risk of becoming even worse.I know screens are not all bad, they have benefits and advantages too. . . hell knows, I spend so much time on screens myself.I think we can be too hard on ourselves at times and Irsquom aware of that. Irsquod go to say that some screen time is now important for a iety of reasons. I also recognise that in the last two years they have become a leline for many people.But lately I have been trying my best to practise what I preach as a storyteller. I want to find ways to wean my kids, and myself, from screens to find a healthier balance, a more personal connection which lts our mental health rather than sapping it.Itrsquos not been easy. When the kids are asked to come off screens, they often explode with what I call screen rage. Itrsquos aswe are cutting an umbilical cord and removing their le support system, and they must fight and protest to restore it. The drama is predictable and tiring, but the good news is itrsquos usually relatively short-lived. Irsquove discovered that kids are eventually glad when they have been taken off excessive use of screens.The trick is to have something engaging to replace it with, as well as to model it myself. Thatrsquos the thing, itrsquos so easy to be a hypocrite to tell my kids itrsquos the end of screen time, while using my phone or writing on my laptop.ldquoBut you are still on a screen, dad! was the rebuke from my astute eight-year-old daughter recently. And she was right, so the rules have to apply to me and my we too.We are slowly getting there. We have no screens before bedtime now, instead a family storytelling session. The hardest part has been establishing the routine with so much to do. But now the kids look forward to it and help make the living room cosy in preparation.And I feel the benefits too. It helps me close down that ruminator in my head, which constantly reminds me of how much I have to do, emails I need to reply to, deadlines I need to meet. Instead I become focused on the moment, on the fact Irsquom sharing the attention of my loved ones and we are all telling stories.I know this now does sound overly romantic, but the thing is nothing can compare to these moments of connection, such as the magic of listening to my wee boy tell another spontaneous chapter of his tale of the haunted pizzeria, or listening to my girls weave a story rooted in their experiences of the day or a favoured fable from their earlier childhood. And Irsquove discovered my we Kate is a good storyteller when given the opportunity.Maybe it felt awkward at first, that we were doing it because I thought we should be rather than because we all wanted to. But that awkwardness soon gave way to excited expectation and genuine enjoyment of the experience. And the darkness helps, itrsquos a blanket which adds atmosphere and allows us to use fairy lights and candles, so in that sense the cold and dark of this time of year is a huge advantage: itrsquos the season for cosy storytelling.The flicker of screens still shine more regularly than the storytelling candles in our house. But the balance is slowly changing. Hallowersquoen helped, it seemed such a natural time for storytelling. And I think I can say we have now established our storytelling sessions as a regular family tradition. When it happens, it feels like ancient magic has entered our house.I run storytelling sessions with parents and many share the challenges I recognise in my own family. All families are dferent, of course, and no child is the same. Buta family storytelling tradition can be established, everyone feels the benefits. Evenonly every now and then, they will be times of real connection that everyone will remember.Soyou fancy trying it and would like my short guide with some reflections and tips, drop me an email.

Martin says that the Spott Kirk Session minutes record the referral of Marion Lillie to the civil magistrate in  on a charge of supposed witchcraft and that in  the minutes record: ldquoMany witches burnt at the top of Spott Loan.Mr Martin was, however, wrong.The Spott Kirk Session minutes are exceptionally legible and clear, and they make no reference whatsoever in  to witch burning at Spott Loan or anywhere .Nor is there any mention of Marion Lillie in .However, in , Marion and her son complained to the kirk session that she was being slandered as a witch.A y investigation followed in which it came to light that Marion did indeed have that reputation locally.Since kirk sessions were not qualied to try witchcraft cases, the session passed the matter on to the civil magistrate, as they were required to do.However, there is no evidence of the case being taken any further and the Spott records show that Marion died a natural death in April  and was buried in Spott kirkyard with the usual ceremonial trappings of bell and mortcloth.Unfortunately, many writers on Scottish witchcraft make the mistake of simply repeating what other writers have written, instead of going to the original records to see what was really going on.Poor Marion has thus been slandered in print as an executed witch for over  years, when half an hour spent actually reading the church records of Spott could have revealed the truth.Until recently, a plaque at the Witchesrsquo Stone stated that Marion Lillie was burnt there, but this has now been replaced by one which makes no mention of her.It may well be that the Witchesrsquo Stone marks the execution of a witch, or witches, but the victim was not Marion Lillie, and any such execution was neither in  nor in , which in any case would be

It is just a rule that would not be broken. We have shown solidarity with the striking GMB members, but it has left our members worse off.ldquoUnless they carried out their full sht, they have been docked a dayrsquos wage.

A typical take home pay after tax on average would be pound a month but in some cases next month they will have lost a full weekrsquos pay of around pound.\"The source added that as some of the staff are with a union which is not on strike they are missing out on wages and were not entitled to strike pay which those involved in the stoppage would have been.The source added: ldquoThis has been a dficult one for our members who have been unfairly penalised and now with the possibility of further strikes they could be affected financially again.ldquoWe also understand park workers who had previously been working out of cleansing depots had been moved back to their own bases which meant they were allowed to continue with their work and be paid without crossing a picket line.After a workforce meeting in George Square on Monday, Glasgow City Council cleansing workers demanded a fresh strike ballot against their employer over low pay.The GMB has now warned it could mean a second wave of strikes could hit cleansing services in Scotlandrsquos biggest city in the run-up to Christmas.The city council refused workersrsquo demands for a one-off ldquoGlasgow Payment for all workers lower grades as a means of addressing the cost-of-living crisis.GMB Scotland Senior Organiser Keir Greenaway said: ldquoItrsquos taken a strike to get Glasgowrsquos leadership in the room and acknowledge the councilrsquos chronic low pay problems, the waste crisis in our communities, and the toxic management culture in the cleansing department.ldquoIt is important to understand that strikes donrsquot happen by accident.

Sport is the most obvious example, where the ldquonation competes in world title competitions on equal terms with ldquostates from across the globe and in many other fields, such as law, the universities, and the arts, Scottish institutions interact with the wider world and are treated as representative of a distinct nation. Furthermore, try to avoid being treated as having Scottish nationalityyou are an author, a painter, an actor or a holidaymaker, once your origin is discovered, the world will label you Scottish.This recognition factor extends to the country itself. Some time ago, you reported on the frustrations experienced by another Catalonian politician when he attempted to explain to the world the desire of many in the region for independence. He found that outside of Spain there was little knowledge of Catalonia, making it dficult to obtain traction for his argument and he contrasted that situation with Scotlandrsquos higher profile. It is common to find people in other countries well aware of the existence of the country of Scotland, even although that knowledge may have been acquired from seeing Brigadoon, Braveheart or the label on a bottle of whisky.As a result of this prominence, Scotland has a further claim to fame: it is the luckiest country in the world. Scots can rub shoulders with peoples from across the planet and interact with them on equal terms, and yet be unwilling to take full responsibility for governing their own country: in other words, they are world champions in having their cake and eating it.Ian Hutcheson, Glasgow.* YOU report that the First Minister met the President of Catalonia at COP. It is indicative of their senses of perspective and proportion that they chose to devote their discussion to local independence matters rather than the small matter of the future of the planet.At the same time, it was interesting to note the Presidentrsquos comment that ldquowhatever the Scottish people decide, Catalonia will support Scotland. It has of course been the policy of Nicola Sturgeon since  to do exactly the opposite, and to ignore what the people of Scotland decided.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.THE MANDATE FOR INDEPENDENCEMICHAEL Sheridandiscusses nationhood, statehood and independence in his letter. He uses some arguments I cannot agree with.For instance, it is indeed true that not all nations form independent states. India, Brazil, Germany or Nigeria are federal republics, very dferent from the UK Union. It is common though, that when national interests within one multinational state start to signicantly erge, democratic countries often decide to peacefully split up .Then there is the tiresome misconception unionist Brexiters use against Scottish independence, that being a member of the EU means not being an independent country. EU member states remain their own masters, they retain control of taxation and only those matters that absolutely need to be determined collectively are so determined.In the UK Union, the narrow constraints of the non-permanent devolution arrangements prevent Scotland from fully realising its ambition to be an open and trustworthy country with a just and fair society and sustainable wellbeing economy.Mr Sheridan mentioned that independence is something \"no one really wants\" in Scotland. In fact, barely six months ago the people of Scotland elected a majority of MSPs who contested the election on a clear mandate to hold a second independence referendum.It is perfectly legitimate to oppose independence. But it is not legitimate to deny democracy. And it is not legitimate to use untrue arguments to justy this lack of democracy.Marie White, Houston.WILL THEY NEVER TIRE OF THEIR BOSS I WATCHED an excellent House of Commons debate this afternoonon the subject of the mishandling of matters relating to Owen Paterson and the generalities surrounding the contemptible behaviour of Boris Johnson and co . There were many good points made from all sides of the House, but it was a pity that two of the main stars could not add their contributions.Mr Johnson was too busy where, but was back in London in time to make an appearance and the chance to apologise to the House. Jacob Rees-Mogglooked very uncomfortable while sitting on the naughty stool for a couple of hours with nothing to say. Stephen Barclay was probably feeling equally uncomfortable, but this was hidden by his face mask.How long will it be before Cabinet ministers decide that they are fed up with being wheeled out to make apologies for a boss who has no principles and who does not deserve to lead either his party or the country Malcolm Rankin, Seamill.* WESTMINSTER, the Mother of Parliaments and the envy of the world. It was always an arrogant and deluded boast but used to be just hot air. Now that air carries the stench of decay and desperation. The UK has become a grubby little place. I feel for our friends in England, but Scotland must free herself from this failing state.Grant McKechnie, Glasgow.SO IS SLEAZE INEVITABLE IN , in his dissertation on canon and feudal law, John Adams , the Second President of the USA, said: \"Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right ... an indisputable, unalienable [sic], indefeasible, ine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers.\"Given the current politicians who sit in Westminster and Holyrood, and the constant media reports of the inappropriate, and what is often defined as the \"sleazy\" behaviour of some of them, I can only assume that we have never had, nor will ever have, anything that can remotely be recognised as that particular \"right\" needed for the preservation of our liberty.Is government sleaze, and often untruthfulness, something we have to live with  Are we forever condemned to living in cloud-cuckoo-land  Are we just wishful thinkers Thelma Edwards, Kelso.NO VISION FOR REFORMING LORDSTHE row over party benefactors being elevated to the House of Lordshighlights the fact that there continues to be no plan or even vision for how to reconstruct that seemingly august but ultimately ludicrous institution into something recognisably democratic.In  the total number of its members was . By  it had risen to  and currently stands at , of whom three are listed as disqualied and one as suspended.In , when its membership was , the Lord Speaker was quoted as saying: ldquoIf we donrsquot reform and shrink our numbers, the Lords will collapse under its own weight.Apart from providing a convenient avenue through which governments can continue to deliver patronage to their often-questionable friends there is no obvious benefit to the current arrangement. It merely stands as a stark reminder of the deficiencies in the supposedly democratic UK parliamentary system.Cameron Crawford, Rothesay.NICARAGUAS STRUGGLE MUST CONTINUETHE presidential elections in Nicaragua on Sunday have been widely denounced as a democratic fraud.Neither the government of Chile nor neighbouring Central American country Costa Rica recognises the results after reports of a national average abstention of .%.

As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone. We must all continue to do our bit to try and stem the transmission of the virus, which is undoubtedly here for some time to come. This is now about learning to manage how we live, work and learn with COVID-. Please continue to follow the guidance, which is outlined by our colleagues at NHS Orkney below.”According to NHS Orkney, around one in three people with COVID- don’t show any symptoms.The health authority believes it is more important than ever to take your two free COVID lateral flow tests every week and record your results, evenyou are fully vaccinated and don#t have symptoms.Lateral flow test kits can be collected from community pharmacies and local test sites or ordered online at nhsinform.scot testing.  You can access the direct link to order LFD tests here: https:www.gov.uk order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flowRecording both positive and negative results allows NHS Orkney Public Health to track the presence of the virus in our communities.Find out more at nhsinform.scot testingIf you, or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID, or you have a positive lateral flow testyou must self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test in Orkney by calling  .A reminder of the ways we stay safe and protect ourselves and others against COVID are:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A further four staff are awaiting PCR tests or results. In total,  Papdale staff are off work today due to illness or other reasons.A total of  pupils remain within class today, and a further  are receiving online learning, out of a school roll of . The remainder —  pupils — are absent from school for a iety of reasons, including COVID, other illness, or due to parental concerns.James Wylie, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “It is unfortunate that we remain in the position today that we cannot safely reopen the four classes mentioned for the remainder of the school week due to COVID-related staffing shortages and the continuous slight rise in pupil cases across these classes.#It is important that this messaging is conveyed to parents as soon as possible in respect of the remainder of the school week to allow them the time to make appropriate childcare arrangements.“Head Teacher Wendy Bowen will be contacting parents now to make them aware of the decision and Nursery Manager Caroline Easton will also be updating those who use the nursery facility. We are continuing to hold daily meetings andthe position changes we will update accordingly.“As always, I thank staff for their hard work in trying to manage this situation and parents for their understanding.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I think legislation is a blunt instrument, but as frontline health and social care workers our goal and our main responsibility should be the health and protection of the very vulnerable, frail and elderly patients in our care.ldquoAs a frontline health worker myself, I find it incomprehensible that someone would want to work in a job like mine and wish not to be vaccinated, so I broadly support it.Asked about the prospect of daily testing as an alternative to unvaccinated staff, she added: ldquoDaily testing is really quite cumbersome. I test twice a week and thatrsquos bad enough. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoI do think that you make a choiceyoursquore a frontline worker, and the choice should be to protect your patients.However, she said pregnant women and those who are planning to become pregnant are her main concern, adding. ldquoThe most often reason thatrsquos quoted to me are women who donrsquot want to have it because of pregnancy.ldquoI think that raises double concerns because we know that only % of women who are pregnant are fully vaccinated, so for frontline workers, I think itrsquos extremely important that these people are educated and helped and supported by their midwery teams to get vaccinated for themselves, their unborn babies, their staff, colleagues and their jobs.Government estimates published on Tuesday show that more than , frontline health and social care staff in England could lose their jobs next springthey refuse to have Covid- vaccines.The Government document warned the policy could have a ldquosignicant impact on the health and care workforce, with estimates suggesting that as many as , could leave their jobs as a result.\"I have concluded that all those working in the NHS and social care will have to be vaccinated.\"@SajidJavid sets out the action being taken to protect health and social care workers, their colleagues and patients from #COVID.More: https:t.co EnnKSH pic ZxdfdWZmdash Department of Health and Social CareNovember , It estimated that by the end of the grace period about , health workers, including , NHS staff, and , social care workers will remain unvaccinated.Any reduction in the workforce ldquomay lead to reduced or delayed services, with the NHS already facing a record backlog of care and grappling with high vacancy rates.Estimates included in the document suggest that around , unvaccinated staff will take up the offer of a jab as a result of the policy.The new rules apply to health and wider social care settings that are regulated by the Care Quality Commission .Mr Javid has said that only those who do not have face-to-face contact with patients or who are medically exempt will not be required to have two doses of a Covid jab.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

With hydrogen emerging as a leading sustainable energy solution, the first-of-its-kind project for Northern Ireland will enable and develop a dynamic, skilled workforce that can take full advantage of hydrogen and clean tech opportunities.The Hydrogen Training Academy is one of  projects across Northern Ireland set to benefit from a total of poundmillion CRF funding – all focusing on skills, education, local business and employment.Led by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, the Academy will be driven by a public-private partnership that includes Northern Regional College, Belfast politan College, Queen’s University Belfast, Ulster University and the University of Birmingham.A consortium of key industry players also involved includes Wrightbus, Energia, Translink, Firmus, EPUK, AES, B Energy, Alexander Dennis, CPH and Kilroot Energy Park – as well as private training providers Horizon and Transport Training Services Ltd.Council has already started the development of the academy earlier this year utilising private sector sponsorship and DfC Covid Revitalisation Funding with the formal procurement of a new state-of-the-art training pod to support the practical training through the Hydrogen Training Academy. The training pod is being built by BSH Limited and will be delivered early in  in time for the first trainees to use.The Mayor commented: “As all eyes around the world turn to COP and the urgent focus on environmental sustainability continues to gather pace, news of this funding really is very timely and very welcome in indeed.“Mid and East Antrim is uniquely placed in Northern Ireland in terms of the key strengths and assets we boast in energy and cleantech that align with zero carbon targets. Through this revolutionary Hydrogen Training Academy, our Borough will continue to build upon its reputation as centre of excellence and the main focal point of the emerging Northern Ireland wide hydrogen economy.“I commend Council’s Elected Members and officers who, in collaboration with our public and private sector partners, have invested a huge amount of time and effort in bringing the project to this stage. I very much look forward to seeing the plans come to fruition in the coming months and witnessing the longer-term economic impact the Academy will undoubtedly have in the coming years.”Graham Whitehurst MBE, Chair of Mid and East Antrim’s Manufacturing Task Force, explained how the Academy will play a “critical role” in training and upskilling both existing employees and new trainees to a recognised professional competence standard required for the hydrogen sector.“The Hydrogen Training Academy will deliver a range of crucial entry-level introductory training for industry across a number of sectors, including energy, transport, gas, manufacturing and engineering,” he said.“This training will be delivered via a combination of online, classroom and practical training focused across four key areas of hydrogen – hydrogen basics and safety, production of hydrogen, high pressure hydrogen and hydrogen in vehicles.”According to Mr Whitehurst, an initial pilot phase at the Academy will see  participants take part in a ‘Train the Trainer’ course, delivered by academics from the University of Birmingham, who have already successfully delivered their ‘KnowHy Training’ to over , participants.Among the participants will be representatives from the Further Education sector in Northern Ireland, who will then draw upon their training to develop and accredit two Level  courses for delivery to young people and employees across the hydrogen industry. Higher Education partners involved will also collaborate to develop a Level  postgraduate certicate in Hydrogen Power, with Ulster University also offering an additional  places on two of its Hydrogen CPD courses.Mr Whitehurst continued: “Through the Hydrogen Training Academy and a range of other initiatives, led by our Manufacturing Task Force, Mid and East Antrim is cementing its position as a hub for SME innovation and commercialisation activity and a springboard for the clean growth sector and industry.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4216000.jpg--.jpg?1636461142000\n","title":"council staff praised by mayor for heroic actions in the community","story":"TTHE Mayor has praised the valiant efforts of Mid and East Antrim staff who responded to exceptional community needs over the last couple of weeks.A reception is being held in the Braid todaywhere the Mayor will congratulate those who were involved in helping members of the community in their hour of need.Four refuse staff are being praised after they helped a seriously injured man in a field off the Lisnamurrican Road.The efforts of the men, while carrying out their daily duties for the Council, are believed to have saved the man’s le.Two other staff from the Environmental Health Team in Ballymena have also been acknowledged by the Mayor for helping to save a man’s le who needed the use of a defibrillator.Nigel Devine and Gary Gordon retrieved the equipment from Ardeevin Council buildings and came to the man’s aid at the Braidwater Retail Park, which resulted in the equipment restarting his heart.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “I am glad the members of the public who were helped by our staff are on the mend.

Although the footage of police being attacked and buses being burned gave them plenty to discuss as well.One of the organisers, Stephen Hughes from St Peter’s Immaculata, said his youth club based in the Lower Falls has been working with Townsend Street Outreach in the Lower Shankill for five years.The youth clubs are directly opposite each other, but on dferent sides of the peace wall.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We have ious programmes for several age groups,” he told the Belfast .“Last weekend it was the Ambassadors for Peace programme and  young people aged from  to  took part in a residential at Share Discovery Village, which is an activity centre in Lisnaskea.”Mr Hughes said the cross-community weekend away was the culmination of months of groundwork.“We prepare the young people for six weeks prior to engaging with each other,” he explained.“Then they had to work together over the last month to prepare for the residential and how they were going to work together. It just happened to be the weekend that all the trouble was happening.”Discussing the violence on the streets of Belfast was “a big topic”, but so was religious dference.“You can’t get away from the rioting,” he added.“The young people just thought it was stupid and that those involved were damaging themselves.“They didn’t even see it as damaging the other community.“It was never about sectarianism. Our kids didn’t see it like that, they saw it as thugs creating problems. They said it was something they didn’t want to be involved with.“But most of our conversation was on faith and the young people were struggling to understand why we’re doing what we’re doing to each other when, as Christians, we’re one faith.”Stephen said that, all too often, there is a focus on the negative behaviour of young people.“But the majority of youngsters in the Lower Falls and Lower Shankill don’t get involved in this. They do, however, get involved in very positive and affirming activities, such as what we did last weekend,” he added.The partner youth clubs offer young people from - a iety of programmes.“For those aged nine to , it’s purely about fun and friendship,” Stephen said.“They visit each other’s clubs, play games we just allow them to be children together.“The we have --year-olds, -, and then we have a leadership programme for those over .“The idea behind the programme is to broaden young people’s experience of people of dference because when you live in Divis, you don’t ever need to meet a Protestant.“You can go from King Street to Lisburn and never meet a Protestant. It’s important, therefore, that we not only understand the people on the other side of the wall but have friendships and relationships with them.“We’re trying to create a more pluralist, more understanding, empathetic and respectful society.”Most ReadStrabane woman ‘forgot’ orce in bid to claim husband’s estateCo Armagh school contacts PSNI over Tik Tok video by pupils which contained harmful comments about staff membersDavid Tweed’s daughters reveal the ‘monster’ he really was after years of sexual abuse at hands of late rugby star fatherUnmask ‘paymaster’ to end Kevin Lunney campaign of violence, urges Mannok director McCartinLoyalists ‘shafted’ by British government: Ex-Downing Street chief Jonathan PowellTop VideosPlayWatch: Lockdown has brought more surfers to North Coast PlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing club\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news de .ece AUTOCROP wh adffbdaefddefcf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news de .ece AUTOCROP wh adffbdaefddefcf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMan and dog struck by a car in west Belfast hit and run Latest Northern IrelandIan Baraclough is expecting teenager Dale Taylor to find his groove at the highest level with Northern IrelandCop flight a mistake, admits NI-born councillor Phelim Mac CaffertyToday#s headlines: Pupils# rate-your-teacher videos #may be criminal#... founding SDLP member Austin Currie dies aged ...

He was unaware that he was the registered owner of the company or its bank accounts.However, the Belfastcan reveal the money laundering scam was not only operating in the Republic. The organised crime gang from both sides of the border was also using people here to launder money through dummy accounts, including a man based in north Belfast and one in the Markets area of the city.Both were heavy drinkers who prior to Covid often boasted online about foreign trips to Spain and Croatia despite being unemployed and with no visible means of income.Dozens of dummy accounts in the names of people from both sides of the border were registered to a council house in Manchester. The companies — claiming to be haulage, engineering or car sales — were registered to an address in the Denton area of the city.Another vehicle hire and haulage business was registered to an address in Bolton in the name of a man from north Belfast with dissident republican links.Read MoreBig read: ‘An ordeal of callous brutality’ that left Quinn executive Kevin Lunney with le-altering injuriesIn profile: The le and crimes of ‘Dublin Jimmy’, the man who orchestrated Kevin Lunney abductionThe address claiming to be a haulage business was in fact an empty house in a rundown area of the northern English town.The money being laundered was the criminal assets of a building and agriculture machinery theft ring, with expensive vehicles being stolen in Ireland and sold in Britain with fake registration papers.The gang was also involved in more than a dozen ATM robberies on both sides of the border in , raking in hundreds of thousands of pounds.And McGuinness was laundering money from an unnamed ‘paymaster’, who is believed to have given the criminals a signicant sum to carry out the attack on Mr Lunney.While McGuinness used gangsters from Dublin to assist in the kidnap, the majority of the attacks on the QIH property and directors were carried out by ‘border bandits’, who had previous republican links but had also been involved in smuggling, ATM robberies and cross-border criminality.The Belfastunderstands many of the attacks over a six-year campaign against the QIH directors were coordinated locally by the ‘border bandits’ with no money changing hands.Following the convictions on Monday, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said multiple lines of inquiry were ongoing, including financial investigations.He also said the inquiry was being supported by a cross-border joint investigation team, which is being supervised by Eurojust.Read MoreAllison Morris:OpinionKevin Lunney attack convictions won’t stop campaign of intimidationMost ReadStrabane woman ‘forgot’ orce in bid to claim husband’s estateCo Armagh school contacts PSNI over Tik Tok video by pupils which contained harmful comments about staff membersDavid Tweed’s daughters reveal the ‘monster’ he really was after years of sexual abuse at hands of late rugby star fatherUnmask ‘paymaster’ to end Kevin Lunney campaign of violence, urges Mannok director McCartinLoyalists ‘shafted’ by British government: Ex-Downing Street chief Jonathan PowellTop VideosPlayWatch: Lockdown has brought more surfers to North Coast PlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing club\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news de .ece AUTOCROP wh adffbdaefddefcf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news de .ece AUTOCROP wh adffbdaefddefcf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMan and dog struck by a car in west Belfast hit and run Latest Northern IrelandIan Baraclough is expecting teenager Dale Taylor to find his groove at the highest level with Northern IrelandCop flight a mistake, admits NI-born councillor Phelim Mac CaffertyToday#s headlines: Pupils# rate-your-teacher videos #may be criminal#... founding SDLP member Austin Currie dies aged ...

done that not only to protect themselves or their colleagues, most of all I think they’ve done it to protect their patients.“We know that people in hospital, they’re already very vulnerable, and the

vaccine, reassuring people, educating them, and that’s the job of the next four or five months.”He added: “Any situation where we lose people just puts extra strain on services and I think, as the

told LBC: “I’m broadly in favour of this move.

I am the kind of guy that would have just ignored it, let it clear itself. All I had was slight stomach cramps and constipation and I let it go for a couple of months. I was just taking tablets to cover it up. “I want people to know you could be covering up something you don’t know is there. It could be nothing but get yourself checked out. “I went to the GP who took bloods and suggested I do a FIT test. The results of the FIT test showed that something wasn’t right and within two weeks I was referred to the Endoscopy unit to have a colonoscopy. “This test showed up something in the bowel. After a week, I got the result that I had bowel cancer. “I received a lot of help and support from the specialist nurses. After that, I had a CT and an ultrasound.” Anthony underwent surgery October  and is currently recovering at home with the support of his we.

Once the wound is healed, there is a possibility I might need chemotherapy, but in tablet form. “I think we got it pretty quick, I don’t know how long its been there. Thetumourwas .cm and they removed cm either side of that as well. The chemo is just to make sure it doesn’t come back again.

I went in on the Thursday and came out on the Wednesday. “The theatre staff, nursing staff and all the support staff on the wards were extremely helpful, caring and supportive. After discharge I have been treated really well by the treatment room staff at the health centre as well as the out of hours staff.” Anthony said he can’t praise the NHS enough, “It’s a slow process to recovery but they were so quick with everything they could do. They couldn’t do enough for you. They work so hard. They haven’t got enough staff and still do everything that needs to be done. “Some of the nurses work hourshts and get no break. I can’t understand why they get any negative comments, they’ve been nothing but brilliant to me. “I know it can be hard to get an appointment but the minute I said my symptoms, I was seen to straight away. “The GPS have been most compassionate and supportive.

SDLP Foyle MLA Sineacutead McLaughlin has called for a strategy to be urgently put in place to deal with the rise in drink spiking incidents. googletag.cmd.push Ms McLaughlin said: “The dramatic rise in reported spiking incidents in the last month shows how common this issue has become and how under reported it has been. Since speaking out on this issue I have been contacted by a number of women who have been victims of spiking. It is important that even more people come forward to report possible criminal activities to the PSNI, as well as to tell their story and share their experience so we can best decide how to tackle this issue. “Drink spiking is a horrendous experience for anyone to be subjected to and it can have long-lasting effects. It can destroy someone’s confidence and leave them reluctant to venture out to socialise for fear of being subjected to a similar attack. Spiking places people directly in harm’s way, it greatly affects people’s self-control and leaves them vulnerable to injury and harm. Most disturbingly of all, it can be used to facilitate rape and other forms of sexual assault. “These recent incidents have demonstrated the importance of dealing with spiking as part of the Executive Office’s strategy for addressing violence against women and girls. I will continue to push for urgent action on this issue in my role as Executive Office Committee chair. We need a joined-up approach to ensure that anyone subjected to spiking gets the help and support they need and that perpetrators are appropriately punished to send out a message this is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cllr Harkin, who represents the Foyleside ward, was speaking after Saturdays Global Day of Action rally in Derry where many turned out to march – in unison with other world cities – to send a message to politicians that too little is being done to halt climate change. googletag.cmd.push Many figures from the Executive parties in Stormont have commented on how environmental changes need to be enforced to curb rising temperatures that could have a disastrous effect on the world with many land area at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels. However, Harkin claims such talk is nothing more than hot air and that politicians need to make good on their words with action. He said: “We commend all those who joined climate action now rallies in Derry and Belfast, across Ireland and across the world yesterday. “It was a powerful global day of action in defiance of the superficial proposals of elites gathered in Glasgow at COP. “All five of the Stormont Executive parties ran to the exclusionary Glasgow conference to join the political establishment in an attempt to showcase their newly found environmental credentials. “As Greta Thunberg said its been more blah blah blah from elites. “Rather than acting as a protector, the Executive has spent the last two decades doing immense damage to our environment. “What the Stormont Executive parties say and do is very dferent. “Just months ago the SDLP Minister for Infrastructure rammed through continued corporate gouging of Lough Neagh over the opposition of environmental campaigners. “The entire Executive allowed the DUP to run riot with the climate destroying going for growth agribusiness strategy for over a decade. “Sinn Feacutein and others said nothing because profits were high and it was good for elites. The same inaction is true for the RHI cash for ash debacle. “The same action gap is clear when it comes expanding rail and public transportation. “The lack of urgency from the DfI Minister means it could be a decade before the Derry rail upgrade happens –at all. And there are constant threats to slash funding for public transportation in order to open it up to privatisation. “The same inaction applies to cleaning up the toxic Mobuoy dump, air quality and toxic mining in the Sperrins. “There are real solutions to address the climate crisis. This requires challenging capitalisms drive for profit no matter what the consequences are for communities and nature. “The political establishment in the Stormont Executive, the Daacuteil and Westminster are not up for this because it means challenging elites, challenging inequality and challenging the status quo. “If Stormont manages to finally pass a Climate Act, the Executive cannot be trusted to ensure even its limited goals will be acted on. “We need a real alternative to the bluff and bluster of the Stormont Executive parties. People power is the key to seeing real action on climate change that can deliver a green transition protecting workers and making sure no one is left behind.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Padraig Delargy, Cllr Sandra Duffy and Cllr Emma McGinley are also in attendance.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson has launched a blistering attack on Environment Minister, Edwin Poots, demanding he “end his dithering and delaying and his half hearted approach to tackling the global emergency”. As the COP conference looking at climate change enters its second week in Glasgow, Ms Ferguson said that more should be done by the Executive to show that the North of Ireland is playing its part in halting the rise in climate temperature. googletag.cmd.push She stressed the need for progressive views to come to the fore at Stormont and that Mr Poots, who once served as DUP leader for three weeks, should step up to the plate and push through “ambitious legislation” on climate change. Ms Ferguson said: “It’s important across the globe that we send a strong message to world leaders that there must be immediate and decisive action to deal with our climate emergency. “This is a global crisis that requires a global solution, and everyone has a role to play in halting catastrophic climate change. “The DUP minister responsible for the environment is dithering and delaying on climate action and his approach has been at best half-hearted. That’s unacceptable.  Northern Ireland Executive Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Edwin Poots “Civic society, environmental groups, legal experts have come together along with progressive political parties and politicians to shape and launch our own climate bill. “Hopefully these progressive views will translate into a majority for real action on the floor of the Assembly. “The North needs ambitious legislation and it needs it before the end of this political mandate in April. “We need net zero targets which enable our businesses, agriculture, infrastructure and energy providers to plan for the future in a transformative way for our society and its population that creates opportunities for green economic growth and jobs. “But we can leave no inidual, community or sector behind in our pursuit of a sustainable future for ourselves and those that come behind us. Nor can we cannot expect the least well off or the vulnerable to pay the cost. “The climate crisis must be tackled on the premise – and with the promise of a just transition. “The climate emergency recognises no borders and we must respond with an all Ireland approach to the climate emergency. That is just common sense.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  All health workers should receive pound payment before ChristmasDerry NewsFerguson: All health workers should receive pound payment before Christmas overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MLA Sinead McLaughlin has said there is urgent strategy needed to tackle rise in drink spiking incidentsDerry News drink spiking incidents reported in the last six weeks to PSNI overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gary Middleton MLA: There is nothing achieved through burning vehicles but there is nothing achieved either through exacerbating fears.Local NewsInferred risks should not have halted Waterside bus services overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kathleen Thompsons daughter, Mintyis joined by Ciara Ferguson MLA, John Finucane MP, Padraig Delargy MLA and Caoimhe Archibald MLA at the th anniversary of Kathleens death.Local NewsFty years on and still no justice for Kathleen Thompson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The measure means that all essential frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month period. googletag.cmd.push This announcement has come as a huge relief and means these local workers and their families have a signicant degree of protection in the event they are unable to attend work due to ill health and reflects the importance of being in a trade union. Along with this new contractual improvement, UNISON trade union representatives working in Apex also successfully negotiated a Covid- recognition payment for all frontline workers. Niall McCarroll of UNISON said: “This recognition agreement between UNISON and Apex Housing Association has only become a reality as a direct result of local workers joining UNISON, becoming active in their workplace and organising towards achieving better working conditions and improved pay and terms and conditions of employment. “Local trade union members mobilising with the support of their union and changing the very ethos and culture across their place of work. “Across Apex Housing Association there are currently  workers in UNISON with workplace reps, health and safety reps and workplace contacts operating across the entire workforce, providing support and expertise when the need arises with the focus being, to leave no worker feeling isolated whilst building up a culture of solidarity, strength through a genuine unity of purpose. “There is much still to achieve within Apex Housing Association but with the growing numbers of workers joining UNISON, it will only be a matter of time before UNISON and Apex deliver on the outstanding issues. I would encourage any local worker employed in the Community and Voluntary Sector to make contact with UNISON Community Branch. “Together we can make positive changes in your workplace and begin the process of you being valued for the work you complete within the community. “Do not let any employer tell you there is no point in being in a trade union.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mr Doyle, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, said that people needed to see “a concrete commitment from Ulster University about Magees expansion”. His remarks come after the Vice-Chancellor, Paul Bartholomew, conceded that the aim of having , students at Magee College was not feasible with  being a more realistic target. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Doyle spoke in Octobers monthly meeting of Derry City  Strabane District Council in favour of inviting Galway-based National University of Irelandto help assist Ulster University in expanding Magees numbers – a motion that was voted down by Council. “The expansion of Magee saga has gone on too long and establishment parties are in a flap about what exactly their position is,” said Cllr Doyle. “In my time as an elected representative the one thing that has been clear is that commitment of partners right across the city to demonstrate long term planning for the city even without finances in place. “I am very concerned about the recent developments around Magee. Firstly the Vice Chancellor tells us on the record that the most we can hope for in terms of Magee student numbers is . “Then Sinn Feacutein, the SDLP, DUP and UUP block a proposal at Council to even speak to the NUI about Magee’s future. “People need to see a concrete commitment from Ulster University about Magee’s expansion. If, for example, the Department for the Economy allocated Ulster University more student places tomorrow, we would have no guarantees that Magee would benefit. “Therefore I am calling on senior leadership within the University to create an ‘Expansion Unit’ within the Vice Chancellor’s Office to specically research, plan and implement into Ulster University’s corporate planning how Magee can grow. They have specic resources in place for Brexit, so this is no dferent. “If confidence is to be built around the partnership with Ulster University for the city deal then I believe this is a prudent and demonstrable action that can help us move forward and I will be re-iterating this to the Vice-Chancellor in the coming weeks.” In response, a spokesperson for Ulster University said: “During the Derry City and Strabane Strategic Growth partnership meeting, Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Bartholomew extended an open invitation to discuss in depth the university’s commitment and plans with councillors in person – this invitation is open to Cllr Emmet Doyle.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line. He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. They didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about. googletag.cmd.push “It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath. “I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.” And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card. “It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said. The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefited from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.  It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear. “All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed. “We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line. “We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.” Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break. “We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. “Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.” But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club. “You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said. The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added. “They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.” And on the weekend that marked the th anniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name. For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family. “That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him. “That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did. They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.” “He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.”  WATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title  A late Cahir McMonigle free sealed victory over reigning champions Greenlough.

He didn’t care one bit, though. After sustaining a knee injury, the Derry minor All-Ireland winner was forced off as the game ticked into added time, and with the scores level at - apiece. googletag.cmd.push For a man who has spent over two decades fighting for that elusive first club championship title, it was a nervous watch from behind his own goal line. As he looked on at Neil Forester giving his winning speech and lting the trophy, he could scarcely believe his eyes. “It is just sheer disbelief. I couldn’t believe that we had finally gotten over the line after so many years of trying and  championship seasons,” he admitted. “It’s always talked about with us, and it’s always talked about in the papers about that first championship win for the club so it’s incredible to finally get that monkey off our back. “It’s relief and it’s a joy to finally get there. There’s so many faces on this pitch that have put in huge shts for this club and for this moment. “There are underage coaches that have done it for  or  years, creating all these players that have come through, and it’s taken all those players and more to deliver a championship. He continued: “It’s a huge community effort and this is just the tip of a very large iceberg of the amount of work that goes in. “We’re lucky that we get to have these days and have these chances, but the spade work has been done by a lot of other people that won’t get the credit, but we as players know their worth.”  There was always a feeling this year that Steelstown had stepped it up yet another gear following their  defeat. The introduction of young players like Donncha Gilmore, Oran McMenamin and Morgan Murray added a new lease of le. “Every year it’s always felt like that team coming behind is always going to be better and although the team has had ups and downs you always feel that the one coming behind is going to add to it and that the championship is not that far away,” explained Dunne. “That’s always been the case, but to actually do it was the big thing. “Had we a championship or two in the bag we maybe wouldn’t have made it as nervy there at the end but now the confidence is there that we can achieve titles, and nobody can take that away. “We knew we were going to fall over the line some day and I’m just thankful that today is that day. He continued: “It was always going to be a tight game that was going to come down to one or two shots or frees. We knew that coming into it. We were never going to cruise to the win. “The dference is just that all of our younger boys have good, calm heads on them. The likes of Donncha Gilmore, Oran McMenamin, Ben McCarron, Cahir McMonagle – all of them. “They’re so good on the ball that there’s only so much that nerves can do. If you’re that good you’re going to create chances and you’re going to score chances, and they did that.”  WATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title  A late Cahir McMonigle free sealed victory over reigning champions Greenlough.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   . Tickets are pound each with all proceeds being ided between the two charities.

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

While Downpatrick has the Fountain Foodbank, Banbridge has a Christian ministry group called J based in the old cinema which will be supporting  families this Christmas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"McKee stands down from UUP  ","story":"MOURNES Ulster Unionist councillor Harold McKee has quit the party.The veteran politician and former South Down MLA has resigned, saying that Doug Beattiersquos leadership of the party is at odds with his religious beliefs.Cllr McKee, who will remain an independent member of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, criticised Mr Beattie for advising members to ldquoleave their Christianity at the door.His resignation comes ahead of next Mayrsquos Assembly election when his wide network of connections across the Mournes area would havebeen a key part of the UUPrsquos drive to secure a seat in South Down.Cllr McKee has confirmed that he intends to serve as an independent ldquoat this point in time with some suggesting that he could potentially be approached by the DUP to join its three councillors on the local authority.He has attacked his former party leader over his stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and a recent vote at Stormont on gay conversion therapy.ldquoIn relation to same sex marriage which Mr Beattie is keen to endorse, I cannot go against the infallible word of God that marriage is between one man and one woman, said Cllr McKee.ldquoI am saddened to observe that these views seem to be of little value in the UUP of today but, rather, a stance of celebrating left-of-centre liberalism seems to be the only acceptable viewpoint.His resignation statement said Mr Beattiersquos leadership was ldquoa far cry from the UUP roots and ldquothe party of Carson and Craig.When Mr Beattie succeeded Steve Aiken as UUP leader earlier this year, he pledged to have a dferent style that would be ldquoable to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity.Cllr McKee said it was ldquobecoming very dficult to endorse a leader who is constantly to the fore promoting liberal issues while conservative values were being squeezedout. A UUP spokesperson said the party was sorry that Mr McKee had decided his political future no longer lay with the UUP.ldquoWe would like to thank Harold for his service and wish him well for the future, the spokesperson said. ldquoThe party will continue to hold out the hand of friendship as Harold takes a new path.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis has described the decision by his former colleague to quit as ldquodisappointing.He continued: ldquoThere are many things that I find myself disagreeing with in all parties, not just my own and sometimes I find that it is better to continue to lobby, talk through and progress these issues from the inside, rather than walk out the door.ldquoThatrsquos democratic politics. Nobody is going to call for the gallows just because your opinion dfers, no matter how rigorous the debate. Unionism demands cohesion with the avoidance of ision.Cllr Lewis also thanked his former colleague for his ldquohelp, support, wisdom and guidance since he was elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He added: ldquoI will always consider Harold a friend and fellow unionist. He has overcome personal turmoil and, like many of us, has a strong faith which has encouraged and supported him through dficult times.ldquoI genuinely wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do next.Earlier this year, DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen quit their party over concerns following the election of Edwin Poots as leader.Mr Poots was subsequently replaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and a short time later Cllr Hanna, who also represents the Mournes area, and Cllr Owen, who represents the Rowallane area, rejoined the party..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_pitch.jpg","title":"New £12m sports pitch at Ballyhornan ‘fantastic facility’ for local community  ","story":"BALLYHORNANrsquoS new G sports pitch has been officially opened.The pound.m investment mdash which includes floodlights and ultra-modern changing facilities mdash has been funded by the Northern Ireland Executiversquos Social Investment Fund and Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Located adjacent to the Ballyhornan Family Centre, the new pitch is already widely used and has brought a number of benefits to the community.The Social Investment Fund contributed pound.m to the new development with the remainder provided by the local authority, with the Ballyhornan Community Association playing a pivotal role in helping secure the funding for the new pitch which was completed in October last year.Designed to increase access to community and leisure services by providing a fit-for-purpose, safe and structured environment to meet the needs and expectations of the Ballyhornan community and surrounding area, the new pitch will make a major contribution to help improve the health and well-being of people in the area.Ballyhornan and District Community Association chairwoman, Patricia Curran, expressed her delight to finally have a completed facility after years of rallying to secure funding for the G pitch which can be used all year round.ldquoWe are very grateful to all the statutory bodies and the local council who supported us throughout this campaign. Without them, we would not have achieved our goal, said Mrs Curran.ldquoThis pitch will be a great asset to Ballyhornan and outlying communities and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to provide a top of the range sports facility.Mrs Curran extended thanks to several people who worked with community officials to secure agreement for the new pitch and deliver it.Special thanks were extended to former local council officer Liam McLernon, Cllr Dermot Curran and former councillor Naomi Bailie for their ldquoimmense support.Mrs Curran also highlighted the support of Celtic Bhoys Football Club which uses the new pitch for its home games. She said the clubrsquos support was essential ldquoin making the project a success.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who performed the official opening, said one of the organisationrsquos key objectives was to improve the health and wellbeing of everyone in the district and reduce health inequalities.ldquoThis new facility will become a thriving hub that will have a hugely positive impact on the local area, benefitting the health and wellbeing of people of all ages by offering improved access to modern sporting facilities, she said.ldquoThis fantastic new facility is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups and the health and wellbeing impact on our community will be immense.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the official opening of the new pitch was ldquotestament to the work done by Mrs Curran and the team at Ballyhornan, working alongside officials from a number of organisations and elected representatives.ldquoItrsquos a real joy to see a picture of the late Eddie McGrady in the community centre in Ballyhornan who officially opened the building, he continued.ldquoThis latest development should serve as a reminder as to what can be delivered when communities, political representatives and government bodies work together in a common effort. I can only hope we get to see more of these good news stories in the time ahead.Cllr Curran said he was ldquodelighted to attend last weekrsquos official opening ceremony and thanked the funders of the new pitch for their respective contributions.ldquoThese investments are investments in our community and something we should all be very proud of. However, none of this would have happened without the hard work and determination of Patricia Curran and her team, he continued.ldquoGetting to this point over the past  years was a hard road with plenty of potholes, but Patricia never gave up. I am delighted that with help she get over those hurdles. However, had it not been for her dedication, this new pitch development simply wouldnrsquot have been possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_billy.jpg","title":"Politicians say ‘no’ to plan for school  ","story":"A NUMBER of politicians and school principals are opposed to creating a new integrated education college in the area.The proposed -place Mid Down Integrated Collegewould replace Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, providing sixth-form places.Public consultation into the development proposal brought forward by the MDIC steering group ended in September and the Education Authorityhas already given its response to the parentsrsquo group behind the proposal.However, DUP politicians and three of four post-primary schools in the area mdash Saintfield High School, St Colmanrsquos High School and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch and St Colmcillersquos High in Crossgar mdash have publicly voiced their concerns for the first time.Strangford MLA Harry Harvey said: ldquoI am disappointed that despite widespread opposition locally, the Education Authority continue to press ahead with these proposals. The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests. An inclusive and imaginative solution would have received our whole-hearted support, but this current proposal unfortunately fell short of this vision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Smell in Downpatrick causes stink with MLA  ","story":"A PERSISTENT foul smelling odour which is prevalent in a large part of Downpatrick is to be addressed by Northern Ireland Water.The utility company is to invest in a permanent dosing plant that will be added to sewage before it is pumped for treatment, with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath.He said he had been lobbying for the odour issue to be addressed and had been working with NI Water to come up with a solution to the problem,The foul smell is noticeable in a large part of Downpatrick including the Ballymote Centre and parts of Killough Walk, Glebetown Drive, Bishops Brae Gardens, Mallard Road, Braeside Drive, Vianstown Road, Cathedral View, Pemberton Park and Pegasus Walk.ldquoEssentially we are looking at a quarter of Downpatrick affected by this odour issue, said Mr McGrath.ldquoIt has been a long road to get to this point, but NI Water is working to come up with a solution. I had previously requested a site meeting with officials to look at the key areas where the issue is most prominent and have been told that talks will take place, alongside some preliminary work.Mr McGrath said this included the continued dosing of sewage at an upstream wastewater pumping station, with NI Water looking to acquire additional land to construct a permanent dosing plant.ldquoSome very welcome news is that a local businessman plans to treat waste generated at his premises before it enters the sewerage system, he said.ldquoThe new system should be up and running in the coming weeks and this is the sort of community activity that Downpatrick does best local people identying solutions and putting their shoulder to the wheel.Mr McGrath said he will continue to seek progress reports from NI Water and keep local people up-to-date with whatrsquos happening.He added: ldquoItrsquos my hope that we are approaching an appropriate and sustainable solution to this long running issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Trust committed to Downe MRI scanner  ","story":"THE districtrsquos most senior health official said she would welcome regular conversations with the public and politicians in helping shape ldquosafe and appropriate services across the area.The commitment by South Eastern Trust chief executive Roisin Coulter came after a meeting she had on Monday with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors.Describing the talks as ldquouseful, positive, open and honest, Mrs Coulter said the health trust was ldquoproud to offer health and social care services from over  facilities across the Down area.She said that since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, all services apart from urgent care have been restored to the Downe Hospital in Downpatrick, where  inpatient beds are open and all outpatient services back up and running.The health chief also issued a reminder that the regional review of urgent and emergency care services across Northern Ireland which is being led by the Department of Health is expected shortly.ldquoIt is anticipated that this review will influence the future of all urgent and emergency care services throughout Northern Ireland, said Mrs Coulter, confirming that the health trust continues to provide a consultant led urgent care centre at the Downe from Monday to Friday between am and pm, alongside a nurse-led minor injuries service on Saturday and Sunday and GP out-of-hours service.ldquoThe urgent care centre has proven very successful with the public and treats an average of  patients every day, the health chief continued.ldquoWe remain committed to the installation of a new MRI scanner at the Downe.

Picture: Colm Lenaghan PacemakerHowever, the consequences of such legislation are profound, as they have been in the Republic.It will automatically create a double administration and bureaucracy, and serious disputes will certainly arise over its implementation.The cost of interpretative services are in the millions across the civil service, for a language which is rarely spoken outside of classrooms by teachers paid to speak and teach it.Double signs and services will appear on everything one can imagine: road signs public building signs estate signs signs on public transport hospitals ATM machines government documents and Irish language broadcasting, the list is never-ending.Compulsory Irish may come in for some or all schools as we have seen in the Republic, depending on what legislation says.This will be a massive change for Northern Ireland and has the potential to destabilise the fragile peace.One also has to wonder why Ulster-Scots has not been legislated for and why is Irish or Gaelic so imperative. Is it to suit Sinn Féin and their united Ireland agenda, who interestingly speak far more English than Irish Westminster has made what amounts to a constitutional change, bar enactment, in Northern Ireland’s administrative infrastructure – now they have to live with it and be totally responsible for its fallout.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

John Hume and Austin Currie talking at SDLP Conference in Newcastle.   .  bwHis decision to squat at a council house in Caledon in June  is widely seen as the beginning of the civil rights movement, which challenged inequality and discrimination against Catholics.He went on to create the SDLP along with John Hume and Gerry Fitt in .In , he won a seat in Dublin West for Fine Gael and pursued a career as TD and minister in the Republic until he retired in .A family statement said: “The Currie family is heartbroken to announce the death of Austin Currie.“Austin was married to Annita for  years. They were a formidable team whose love for each other and their family saw them through some of the worst times in Northern Ireland’s recent history.“He is survived by his children Estelle, Caitriona, Dualta, Austin and Emer, their partners and  grandchildren.”The family statement continued: “Our Daddy was wise, brave and loving and we thank him for the values that he lived by and instilled in us.“He was our guiding star who put the principles of peace, social justice and equality first.“From Edendork in county Tyrone to the bog of Allen, Daddy was most at home with his beloved Annita and his family, surrounded by newspapers and grandchildren.“We will miss him deeply.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mr Currie was a “titan” of the civil rights movement.He added: “His housing protest in Caledon in  was one of the key sparks for the civil rights campaign that followed and he spoke for a generation of young nationalists when he refused to allow his constituents to be treated as second class citizens anymore.“His radical activism led him to join together with other young leaders and together they formed our party on the principles of a shared society where everyone got a fair shot at le, something so many of their contemporaries had been denied.“Each time we lose a political giant like Austin we lose a piece of our history.“While moments like this bring us great sadness, it also gives us the opportunity to celebrate the man and the huge contribution he made to politics in both the North and South of our island.”Mr Varadkar said: “I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of Austin Currie, and extend my sympathies to his family.“A pioneer of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, Austin was one of the outstanding politicians of his generation, highlighting discrimination against nationalists in issues like housing with a famous sit-in protest at Caledon.He added: “I knew Austin as a brave, courageous and principled man.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
