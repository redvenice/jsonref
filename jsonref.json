I think science informs. It doesn\u0027t decide, and it doesn\u0027t lead the way.\u0027So it\u0027s a key part of the input to decision making and it\u0027s very important that the decisions are informed by science, so I think informed by science is the right way to describe this. \u0027Rather than sort of slavishly following, not least because science doesn\u0027t have all the answers to these things. \u0027And of course, you know there are many other parts that need to come into these very complex decision making processes.\u0027Responding to whether Winston Churchill\u0027s phrase that \u0027scientists should be on tap, not on top\u0027 was better, he said: \u0027Should we be available when needed? Yes. \u0027Should we be clear about what it is we\u0027re trying to say and fearless in the way we do it? Yes. Even if it is uncomfortable. \u0027And should we be absolutely sure people have understood it? Yes. \u0027Should we be on top in the sense we make the decision? No. We\u0027re not elected politicians. We\u0027re not people who\u0027ve got the democratic mandate to make the decisions.\u0027 The country\u0027s top scientist also addressed accusations that the Government made U-turns on Covid policy, such as face masks in schools, a circuit breaker lockdown and vaccine passports. He said: \u0027Science is actually about uncertainty. \u0027Many people think science is about the facts you get out the other end...\u0027We\u0027re always challenging those facts, and we\u0027re trying to look and things change, and that uncertainty is part of the progress of science. \u0027Trying to get that framed in some way because it\u0027s no good going to a politician and saying, well, it\u0027s all uncertain. We just don\u0027t know.\u0027And decisions have to be made, so it\u0027s trying to get the boundaries of that uncertainty clear for people is important.\u0027He added: \u0027But you know the other thing that\u0027s different is that as a scientist, when you get evidence that changes your mind because it\u0027s now giving you new information, that is an exciting part of scientific progress. For a politician that feels like a U-turn. \u0027Or for the media that often feels like a U-turn.\u0027And that that\u0027s a very interesting distinction that\u0027s important to try and communicate effectively to politicians. It\u0027s not a U-turn. \u0027This is new evidence that gives you a new position.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan NOT bring Lilibet Christened Church England","story":"Share this articleIn August, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliam told the Express the couple will \u0027do things their own way\u0027 with their daughter Lilibet. He said: \u0027It seems certain that her christening will be in Meghan\u0027s home state and with the secrecy but without the controversy that surrounded Archie\u0027s christening.\u0027 The couple have never released an image of their daughter to the public, with royal commentator Richard saying the decision shows the Duke and Duchess are acting on their own terms.The latest claims come after it was revealed that Prince Harry was not expected to return to Britain next week to join his brother Prince William at a party to honour their mother. The party had originally been planned for July 1, when the brothers unveiled a statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, on what would have been her 60th birthday.Prince Harry flew back for the unveiling without wife Meghan, who had given birth to the couple\u0027s second child, Lilibet.Due to coronavirus restrictions, the plans were scaled back, with just the Princes, their uncle Earl Spencer and aunts Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes present.Harry was due to attend the rescheduled party for 100 guests, believed to include Sir Elton John, on October 19, although it is unclear if Meghan would have accompanied him.However sources this week said it was not expected he would return for this. Since attending the statue\u0027s unveiling, Harry has announced he is writing his memoirs. They are due for release next year, when the Queen will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne. In February a spokesperson for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry confirmed the couple were expecting a second child together. The couple shared their announcement - aptly on Valentine\u0027s Day - by posting a black and white image of Harry resting his hand on Meghan\u0027s head as she lay in his lap underneath a tree.\u0027The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple\u0027s longtime friend Misan Harriman. What wonderful news for the Sussexes!!\u0027 their spokesperson added. Lilibet – whose middle name is Diana – was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in June.    It is understood the Queen was informed by Prince Harry that her great grandchild would be named in her honour, ahead of their official announcement which was made on their official website. However, Buckingham Palace appeared to be caught off guard by the timing of the Sussexes\u0027 news with a spokesman for the palace congratulating the couple 90 minutes after the announcement broke.    Omid Scobie, a journalist favoured by Harry and Meghan, later tweeted that the couple would \u0027not be sharing a photograph at this time\u0027 of Lilibet and that they were now on \u0027parental leave\u0027. He said the couple\u0027s office was encouraging anyone who wanted to send gifts to support organisations working for women and girls. The name Lilibet was coined by the Queen and used by her younger sister Margaret and their parents.George VI once said: \u0027Lilibet is my pride. Margaret is my joy.\u0027Lilibet arrived six days before what would have been the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 100th birthday."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/11/17/28266308-0-image-m-4_1589215218794.jpg","title":"Jeremy Hunt admits groupthink did not adequately prepare Covid pandemic","story":"Share this articleHe added: \u0027We know that clearly wasn\u0027t the case.\u0027Ex-Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who stood down last month, previously admitted \u0027famously all the preparations and the plans that were in place were for a flu pandemic\u0027.Britain\u0027s health chiefs war-gamed several flu pandemic scenarios before the onset of Covid.And No10\u0027s response to the coronavirus crisis was largely based on policies that were thought to have worked against flu. But it emerged this week that officials did in fact wargame such a scenario.Operation Alice, carried out in 2016, even recommended ministers start stockpiling personal protective equipment (PPE), invest in a digital contact-tracing system and introduce testing of foreign travellers.The Government has since been criticised on all three of these areas of its response in the actual pandemic, despite the recommendations to prepare for them coming four years before the crisis.  Mr Hunt, who now chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said the countries \u0027that have direct experience of Sars and Mers were the ones who responded best in the first half the pandemic\u0027.Questioned on the impact of Mr Johnson\u0027s personality early on in the pandemic, Mr Hunt suggested the PM delayed lockdown because he was following the advice, not because he thought it would be \u0027unpopular\u0027.He said: \u0027Every PM\u0027s personality matters. But in this particular case.. he was following the scientific advice.\u0027And the question we have to ask is why across the whole of the system in those early months, everyone was advising the wrong approach?\u0027Mr Hunt said that when images of the pandemic in Italy hit TV screens in the UK, the focus was on hospitals rather than other places like care homes.One of the biggest errors made towards the start of the pandemic was that hospitals discharged tens of thousands patients into care homes without testing them for the virus because officials were focused on \u0027protecting the NHS\u0027. This had the devastating impact of \u0027seeding\u0027 the disease among the vulnerable, the report claimed. Almost one in four people who died from coronavirus lived in a home, with 40,000 residents succumbing to the virus up until this May.Mr Hunt said: \u0027The focus of attention, as so often happened in my time as well when I was health secretary, became what was happening in hospital wards, and we didn\u0027t have that bigger picture as to the whole system.\u0027And that\u0027s what we urgently need to put right.\u0027He said that \u0027in the context where there were things that we didn\u0027t know, it took us too long to get to the right approach\u0027.Referencing the report, he said: \u0027We say this was like a football match with two very different halves, and yes there were those very serious errors that… led to many tragedies.\u0027But in the second half of the match, we have the vaccine programme which was, we say, the most effective initiative in the history of British science and public administration.\u0027We had the discovery of treatments like dexamethasone in the UK which saved a million lives worldwide, we had that extraordinary response in the NHS which saw everyone who needed a ventilator and an intensive care bed, got one.\u0027The report concluded Britain led the world on vaccine development and medical research throughout the pandemic — saving millions of lives globally."},{"url":null,"title":"Moment terrified man leaps car roof away dog apologizes driver","story":"Share this articleMan Jumps On Car Roof to Escape Dog - YouTube"},{"url":null,"title":"Yet nightmare Christmas Britains busiest port turmoil","story":"Share this articleWorkers at the supermarkets said deliveries had ‘just not turned up’.Meanwhile, there were warnings of price rises affecting staple items including baked beans and coffee.Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said yesterday the firm is ‘raising prices, where necessary’, blaming a lack of truck drivers in the UK and labour shortages and an increase in logistics costs in the US.He added: ‘If costs keep going up we’re going to struggle. We will simply have to increase the price for customers.’The price of Arabica coffee has jumped almost 73 per cent in the past year to levels not seen since 2014 after 20 per cent of coffee plants in Brazil - the world’s biggest bean exporter - were killed by drought and severe frost in the past year.In Colombia, the third largest coffee-producing country in the world, farmers have refused to deliver bags of beans unless they receive higher prices.Shoppers face higher supermarket prices as part of a deal to protect vital supplies of carbon dioxide.The price of the gas, which is used to carbonate drinks, preserve food and stun animals for slaughter, is expected to rise fivefold after the Britain’s biggest manufacturer threatened to shut its factories.Carbon dioxide is also used in surgical operations in hospitals, and as a coolant for nuclear power stations.Ministers stepped in with a subsidy worth tens of millions to keep the supply going for three weeks and allow space for CF Fertiliser, which makes three-fifths of the UK’s supply, to negotiate with its customers.It has now agreed higher prices that will guarantee supply until at least January.But drinks companies and food producers may be forced to pass on the huge cost increase, thought to be from £200 to £1,000 per ton, to their consumers.Industry bosses warned yesterday that three in five retailers expect to increase prices before Christmas in the face of rising costs for energy, ingredients and wages.It comes after last month’s warning from Tesco chairman John Allan that food inflation could hit 5 per cent this year after a long period of falling prices.Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the new deal between CF Fertiliser and its customers – industrial gas companies – was a ‘more sustainable solution’. He added: ‘Critical industries can have confidence in their supplies of CO2 over the coming months without further taxpayer support.’The deal reflected ‘the vital importance of this material to everything from our nuclear industry to hospitals to the food and beverage industry’.Last week Mr Kwarteng temporarily exempted parts of the CO2 industry from competition law so the deal could go through. Previously, ministers had warned that companies would have to accept a large rise in CO2 rates, with a possible fivefold increase.Now CO2 customers will pay CF Fertilisers a set price until January, which will let the company continue to operate while global gas prices remain high. But with energy bills for its factories expected to rise further still, there is no guarantee that the firm can keep going beyond that date.And a CF spokesman said the company expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to develop ‘robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand’.Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ‘The Government has taken decisive action in these exceptional circumstances to allow a deal to be reached which will continue the supply of CO2.’Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: ‘We welcome news of this arrangement, which provides some certainty of supply over the next few months. Although CO2 is a only a small percentage of total cost for most soft drinks producers, the significantly higher prices for supply only add to the economic pressures already facing manufacturers, including the shortage of HGV drivers.’Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ‘We welcome a deal to ensure that CO2 supplies are secure until after Christmas.‘However, this is yet another example of cost pressures in the supply chain, along with rising transport costs, higher energy and commodity prices, and ongoing labour shortages.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Tory James Gray avoids suspension saying Sajid Javid Nadhim Zahawi look alike","story":"Share this article \u0027But a lot of volunteers at the event were upset by them and Mr Zahawi spoke to Gray afterwards.\u0027A lot of people at the event - who were all working hard to roll the vaccine out - have been talking about what had happened.\u0027  Gray had been hosting the reception on September 8 to thank St John Ambulance volunteers and frontline staff for what he described as their \u0027extraordinary efforts\u0027 during the pandemic.The Monday after the get-together he proudly posted a picture of himself with Mr Zahawi and SJA chief exec Martin Houghton-Brown online. It is not clear whether the photo was taken before or after the incident.In fact Mr Javid had not yet arrived at the event when it happened and only turned up later and posed for pictures. The day before the reception, at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Mr Gray had raised the importance of the role of St John, adding: \u0027This is, I think, the first opportunity for the whole House to thank all those who have played a role in rolling out the superb vaccine programme over the past six months or so, ranging from the whole of the national health service to the military.\u0027If I may, I should like to make particular mention of the Order of St John—St John Ambulance.\u0027Boris Johnson had replied: \u0027The volunteers have been fantastic and I have met many of them over the past 18 months who have done an absolutely astonishing job.\u0027Mr Gray was admitted as a commander of the Order of St John back in September 2020.He has been the MP for North Wiltshire since 1997 but has been dogged by a number of scandalsIn 2006 he was exposed to have been having an affair while his then wife was battling breast cancer.Mr Gray had been conducting a 19-month affair with married Philippa Mayo when their relationship was revealed.They subsequently set up home together just eight miles from his wife\u0027s cottage and got married in 2009.His former wife Sarah was said to have told friends after the split she wanted \u0027His political career to crash and burn\u0027. After MailOnline put the story to Mr Gray, he insisted he had not been racist in any way or said \u0027They all look the same to me\u0027.He said he had been expecting Mr Javid to be there earlier and saw the top of Mr Zahawi\u0027s head and wrongly assumed it was him.He added: \u0027The notion that this is some sort of racist remark is ridiculous. They are two very good friends of mine.\u0027I said \u0027I am sorry to confuse the two of you. You two look very alike\u0027.\u0027I said \u0027I am sorry if I got you too mixed up\u0027\u0027The idea that this is racist is completely untrue.\u0027Nadhim did not speak to me about it afterwards, he spoke to a lot of people.\u0027They are very close friends of me, both men.\u0027He said he had not mixed them up before, adding \u0027They are very close friends of me, both men.\u0027Mr Gray also denied St John Ambulance had asked him to step back from charity engagements. Mr Javid has previously spoken passionately about who critics on the far right and the left racially abused him. The former home secretary said he had been called \u0027P***\u0027 and \u0027come to expect\u0027 abuse over his Muslim background.Speaking to Nick Robinson\u0027s Political Thinking podcast in 2019, he said: \u0027I get it from the far-left, including lots of Asians, who would say \u0027he\u0027s not brown enough\u0027.\u0027I get it from the right, and the far-right in particular, saying \u0027he\u0027s too brown\u0027. Those critics have got a lot in common – they don\u0027t like me because of my colour \u0027They believe, whether they\u0027re coming from the far-left or the far-right, that someone\u0027s colour, faith or background should define who they are – rather than the content of their character.\u0027That is something that sadly I\u0027ve got used to.

While the Treasury is understood to be reluctant to fund a bailout, ministers are weighing up proposals from Kwarteng to provide short-term loans or guarantees while gas prices are high, to help sectors such as steel, glass, chemicals and paper. The trade body UK Steel said it backed Kwarteng in calling for assistance from the chancellor Rishi Sunak, but warned that short-term lending alone would leave the industry battling against a “hostile environment” and at risk of shutdowns. Its director Gareth Stace said: James Gray was told to step back as a commander of the St John Ambulance (SJA) after reportedly introducing the then vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi as the health secretary at a parliamentary reception last month. Sajid Javid is the health secretary. The event was held to honour volunteers who helped the NHS with the vaccine programme during the spring and summer. Gray, 66, was said to have mixed up the two ministers in the room. A witness who spoke to the Daily Mail said when Gray’s error was pointed out to him, he told the audience: “They all look the same to me.” The witness added that afterwards, Zahawi pulled Gray to one side for a private conversation. The quintet, including Corbyn’s former director of communications Seumas Milne and former chief of staff Karie Murphy, said they would “vigorously defend themselves” in a high court action. Labour has filed papers accusing the pair, along with the communications team member Georgie Robertson, the former head of complaints Laura Murray and staffer Harry Hayball, of having responsibility for leaking the April 2020 report, according to their lawyers Carter-Ruck. The report claimed to have found “no evidence” of antisemitism complaints being handled differently to other forms of complaint during Corbyn’s tenure, or of current or former staff being “motivated by antisemitic intent”. His time as leader of the opposition was marred by complaints of racism against Jews and accusations senior officials were slow to crack down on members who promoted antisemitism. But the report found bias against the Islington North MP contributed to “a litany of mistakes” that hindered the effective handling of the issue. In a statement issued by lawyers for the five, they said: Philip Allott, who oversees police and fire services in North Yorkshire, was widely condemned for his comments suggesting Everard “never should have submitted” to the arrest by killer Wayne Couzens. Couzens, a politan Police officer, falsely arrested the 33-year-old in order to kidnap her before raping and murdering her and was sentenced to a whole life order last month. The North Yorkshire Police, Fire and Crime panel will meet on Thursday with discussion of Allott’s comments, for which he subsequently apologised, forming part of the agenda. Smith, the MP for Skipton and Ripon and a former cabinet minister, said: He since issued an apology for his remarks. North Yorkshire Fire Brigades Union has previously called for Allott to go, with its brigade secretary Steve Howley saying he has “received an unprecedented amount of correspondence from FBU members regarding Allott’s comments – the common theme is outrage”. He added: Hansard shows that the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, told the Commons on Wednesday 11 March 2020 that there was not, in fact, a consensus among the scientific and political communities: Barclay acknowledged there had been “difficult judgments to be made” over coronavirus lockdowns. Asked if the timing of the autumn 2020 lockdown was an error, he told the same programme: He added that the failure to implement an earlier lockdown was a consensus decision. He claimed: In comparison, he said increasing testing capacity in the UK was “painfully” slow. This had an impact on care homes, Clark added, because testing everyone being transferred there from hospital would have prevented the “seeding of infections into care homes”. Clark said “everyone working in this was trying to do the best thing, there’s not a single person that wasn’t motivated and working all hours to try to make the right decisions”. Nevertheless, he said there was a need “to confront ourselves with some difficult truths, especially where they do lead you to be able to do things differently”, though he rejected calls to bring forward the public inquiry.Hunt said there was a fatalism in the early days of the pandemic response that led the government to believe that widespread immunity was the only way to stop coronavirus. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning whether there had been a policy of herd immunity, the former health secretary said: Hunt said part of the reason was that the government believed some of the measures taken to curb the spread of the virus in China, where the pandemic originated, “would not be possible in a democracy”.Hunt said that, when images of the pandemic in Italy hit TV screens in the UK, the focus was on hospitals rather than other places such as care homes. He told Good Morning Britain: He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain the UK should have locked down earlier and “the prime minister is of course ultimately responsible, but some of the advice that he got was also wrong”. He added: He said the countries that have “direct experience of Sars and Mers were the ones who responded best in the first half the pandemic”.Referring to the Test and Trace system, he said: Hannah Brady, a spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, criticised a passage in the report that said the “success of the vaccine programme has redeemed many of the persistent failings of other parts of the national response such as the test and trace system, so that the outcome is far better than would have been the case without this success”. She said the report “manages to barely mention the over 150,000 bereaved families”, adding: Brady said the report proved a judge-led independent inquiry, which has been promised by the government in spring, “must have bereaved families at its heart”. Asked if he would apologise, he said:  Two former Conservative ministers, now serving as chairs of parliamentary committees, said Whitehall displayed “groupthink”, evidence of British exceptionalism and a deliberately “slow and gradualist” approach. And health officials and political leaders were criticised for failing to be transparent with their data, meaning to little constructive criticism could be offered. Representing the government this morning, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Stephen Barclay has sought to portray the pandemic as an unprecedented situation ministers were trying to get to grips with in real time. He has told Sky News: However, critics would point out that this was the situation that faced every nation on the planet, yet the UK compared poorly with many."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"An increasingly vigilant public and punishments might help save this crucial habitatStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: iStockThe vast majority of doctors in training reject the draft consultant contract under Sláintecare and say they will emigrate rather than accept it, according to a new study.Some 87 per cent of trainee doctors say they are unlikely to consider the public-only contract being offered, and 94 per cent say they would consider working abroad rather than accept its terms.More than 1,100 higher specialist trainees and fellows in training to become consultants were surveyed for the study, published in the Journal of Medical and Health Studies.Over 90 per cent reported being significantly concerned about the contract, in relation to their ability to advocate for patients and to provide patient care, and also in relation to potential working conditions in the future and the difficulty in changing the contract once it is agreed.Earlier this year, at the opening of contract talks with representative bodies, the Government offered salaries ranging from €210,000 to €252,000 for hospital consultants from mid-2022 who will work exclusively in the public system.Private practiceUnder the proposals, consultants working under the Sláintecare contract would not be permitted to carry out private practice either in public or private hospitals.Initial talks took place in early May, but medical organisations were unhappy at what they maintained was the “not for negotiation” stance of the department.A barrister has since been appointed to chair the talks and the Department of Health has removed a controversial proposal in the draft contract which would have imposed restrictions on the right of consultants to advocate on behalf of their patients.In the study, respondents were asked a series of questions before, and after, reading the contract.Before reading it , 55 per cent said they wished to pursue a mixed public-private practice and 38 per cent stated a preference for a public-only contract after reading the document, only 6 per cent preferred the public-only option.First-choice optionEmigration was the first-choice option for 1 per cent of doctors before reading the draft contract, but 40 per cent afterwards. Exclusive private-only work was the first choice of 0.2 per cent before reading, and almost 20 per cent after.A significant majority (82 per cent) said they had concerns over possible deskilling if they were confined to public hospital practice, due to an anticipated lack of theatre access.“Almost all respondents have stated they may emigrate rather than accept the current conditions, which will have catastrophic implications for training, service provision and workforce planning,” the study notes.“The aim of the Sláintecare contract is to attract and train the very best clinicians. However, the currently proposed contract seems highly unlikely to retain these very clinicians.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"budget 2022 main points what s in it for you","story":"Budget 2022 is expected to amount to about €4.7 billion, of which €1 billion is believed to be available for new spending with €500 million allocated for tax measures.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will present Budget 2022 at lunchtime on Tuesday, a multibillion-euro package that will see the Government attempt to tackle the rising cost of living.Budget 2022 is expected to amount to about €4.7 billion, of which €1 billion is believed to be available for new spending with €500 million allocated for tax measures.Here are the main points we know so far about where that money is going:Welfare and pensions- €5 increase in fuel allowance to take effect immediately - €5 increase for pensioners, jobseekers and other welfare recipients from January - Christmas bonus will be paid in full- Back-to-school allowance to increase by €10 - Carers’ allowance to increase by €5 and more carers will qualify for payments- €3 extra for the living alone allowance- Hot meals programme will expand to about 100 Deis schools- €10 increase in the income threshold for the working family payment- Extension of the period during which the domiciliary care allowance can be paid for children in hospital from three months to six months- Reduction in the number of PRSI contributions young people have to make to access dental treatment, from 260 to 39 weeks- Qualified child payment will increase by €2 to €40 for under-12s, and by €3 to €48 for over-12sIncome taxes and work- Tax credits will be indexed and bands will offset the impact of inflation on people’s takehome pay. - Income tax deduction amounting to 30 per cent of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and broadband in respect of those incurred while working from home- The minimum wage will increase by 30 cent - Exemption from top rate of USC for all medical holders and those over the age of 70, earning less than 60,000 to be retained- Help-to-buy scheme to be extended for 2022 but a review will be carried out over the year- €194 million for homeless services - €18 million for Traveller accommodation schemes- €65 million for housing adaptation grants- €85 million for retrofitting- A zoned land tax will be introduced to encourage building of homes.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe While the increase in the fuel allowance will come into effect from the night of the budget, the €5 increase for pensioners, jobseekers and other welfare recipients will come into effect from January.Speaking on his way into Government Buildings on Tuesday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the backdrop to the budget is Ireland emerging from the pandemic.Mr Martin said, in terms of children and families, the Government will “do the best we can within the resources to support children in education, in childcare and in reducing costs in terms of access to health within the health system itself both in terms of primary care and GPs and in terms of hospitals as well and access to hospitals.”It was important that the budget’s social welfare package reflect the issue of rising fuel costs and “the energy situation across the world”, said Mr Martin, in comments broadcast on RTÉ.Housing, education and carersThere will be €194 million for homeless services, €18 million for Traveller accommodation schemes, €65 million for housing adaptation grants and €85 million for retrofitting. The help-to-buy scheme will be extended in its current form beyond the end of the year.Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien brought a memo to Cabinet on Tuesday for a targeted commercial rates waiver for Q4 2021, at a cost of just over €62 million, for the hospitality, arts and entertainment, travel agency and airport sectors.Minister for Education Norma Foley secured a commitment that the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools will be reduced by one point.In addition, some €18 million will be allocated to expand Deis scheme. A further 1,165 additional SNAs and 980 special education teachers will be added.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys will announce a significant package for carers that will see the weekly payment increase by €5 along with significant changes to the means test for the allowance. The changes will mean the first €50,000 in savings will be disregarded from the means test, up from the current level of €20,000.It is understood there will also be €3 extra for the living-alone allowance, while the hot meals programme will expand to about 100 Deis schools.Business, health and justiceThe State’s support scheme for businesses, the EWSS (employment wage subsidy scheme), will be extended to next April but will begin to be tapered from December. Income tax relief will be provided in the form of indexing tax credits and bands to help offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay.In justice, Ms Humphreys secured the recruitment of 800 additional gardaí next year, as well as a 20 per cent increase in the Garda mountain bike unit. Some 400 Garda civilian staff will also be recruited, bringing the total level of Garda staff to 3,800, the highest-ever number.A new community safety innovation fund will be given an initial allocation of €2 million.The Department of Health is set to receive less than €1 billion in direct Covid-19 funding next year, down from €2 billion in Budget 2021. A renewed focus on medical waiting lists will see a funding package of more than €200 million mobilised to tackle backlogs. Free GP care for children up to the age of seven will also be a feature of Budget 2022.There will be a cut to hospital charges for children and funding for disability services will increase by about €100 million.The limit for the Drug Repayment Scheme is to be reduced from €100 from €114.Ms Humphreys is also to introduce a new grant designed to support people who suffer hair loss due chemotherapy or from illnesses such as AlopeciaThe measure is to be introduced through the expansion of the Treatment Benefit scheme – providing a grant towards the purchase of wigs and hair pieces for people who suffer hair loss due to chemo or illnesses such as alopecia.The grant is expected to be worth up to €500 towards the cost of the wig.Minister for Culture and the Arts Catherine Martin has secured a commitment to introduce a pilot basic income scheme for artists in January as well as a €25 million fund to help venues hold events after they reopen towards the end of the month.It is expected there will be 50 cent imposed on a packet of 20 cigarettes.

The Government is preparing to unveil Budget 2022 on Tuesday. Photograph: Crispin RodwellThe Government is preparing to unveil Budget 2022 on Tuesday and, until this weekend, the room for manoeuvre appeared to be limited. Unexpectedly strong economic forecasts over the weekend have dramatically improved the outlook for public finances and could lead to late pressure on the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to go that little bit further. There are still some discussions ongoing around the fuel allowance, for example, but the feeling is that most of the headline measures have now been nailed down. Here is everything we know so far:Budget 2022Tuesday’s budget package is expected to amount to about €4.7 billion. Some €3.2 bn of this is committed to existing pay and spending increases, €1 bn will be available for new initiatives and €500 million allocated for tax measures.Welfare and pensionsWelfare payments including the fuel allowance are to increase by €5 under a deal struck by the Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys ahead of the publication of the budget tomorrow.Pensioners will receive an extra €5 a week while other welfare payments such as the jobseekers payment and maternity benefit will also increase by the same amount from January. The Christmas bonus will be paid in full while the back-to-school allowance will increase by €10.The €5 increase in the fuel allowance will take effect from budget night, however, as Ministers remain concerned about backlash over the planned increase in the carbon tax.Income taxes and work It is widely expected that one of the headline tax measures will involve the indexing of tax credits and bands to offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay. Much of the €500 million for tax measures will be spent on this. There may also be good news for those who are still working from home. At present, employers can give €3.20 a day tax-free to their employees. Alternatively, workers can claim a proportion of home expenses back themselves. It is expected that this system will be updated with workers able to defray the cost of utilities against the tax they pay. If the minimum wage increases in January, an increase in the USC thresholds, to keep the tax burden of those on this wage at a similar level, is likely.Carbon taxCarbon tax will rise by €7.50 per tonne as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per year. This means an estimated €1.28 extra on a 60 litre tank of petrol and €1.48 more for a full fill of diesel from midnight tomorrow. Increases in the cost of other fuels such as kerosene (900 litre tank up €19.40), natural gas (average annual usage up €16.95), coal (40kg bag up 89c) and peat briquettes (12.5kg bale up 20c) would not kick in until May.Childcare and parentingA childcare package of about €100 million next year is expected, and this may rise to €200 million annually once ramped up. As part of this, fees will be frozen for many parents and there is likely to be expanded access to subsidies for working families and unemployed people. The Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman has already indicated that he hopes to make changes to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) next year and increasing the income limits to access the scheme is one measure under consideration. It is understood that a new direct investment in childcare services will improve staff pay in return for a commitment not to increase fees. Separately, an extra two weeks of parent’s leave is set to be introduced from next August so that parents of a newborn can take up to seven weeks off work supported by the State.EducationDetails emerged on Monday of a budget deal for 1,000 special needs assistants and more than 400 special education teachers. A significant expansion of the Deis scheme was also in prospect while an increase in the Susi student grant for the first time in 10 years has also been mooted.HealthThe Department of Health is set to receive less than €1 billion in direct Covid-19 funding next year, down from €2 billion in Budget 2021. About half of a total Covid-19 spending package of €6.8 billion will be held back as a contingency fund. The renewed focus on medical waiting lists will see a funding package of more than €200 million mobilised to tackle backlogs. Spending on a women’s health package will quadruple to €20 million, while the Department of Health will be allowed to retain some of its underspend to fund more staff increases. It has also been reported that free GP care for children up to the age of seven will be a feature of the budget. Improvements to the drug refund scheme are also on the cards as is a new €10 million package to rollout free contraception.ClimateMore than €200 million is set to be earmarked for retrofitting in excess of 20,000 homes, with half to be spent on 4,500 free home upgrades for low-income or energy-poverty households. The remainder will be given in grants. Some €360 million will go on active travel measures.Cigarettes and alcoholIt is expected that there will be 50 cent imposed on a packet of 20 cigarettes. Alcohol looks likely to remain untouched as the Government is aware of the pressure on the hospitality industry because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Aviation and tourismA €100 million recovery package for the tourism sector is planned, focused on sustainable recovery, festivals and nightlife activities. The Department of Tourism will also target UK and US visitors with flagship events such as an American football college game. A basic income guarantee scheme for artists will be piloted from January. Some €25 million will be put aside to help venues put on events after the next reopening date of October 22nd.HousingSpending on housing is set to rise to €4 billion. This will include nearly €200 million in funding for homeless services and €85 million for retrofitting. An extension to the Help to Buy scheme is expected. The scheme offers a tax rebate to first-time buyers of new homes and is due to run out at the end of the year. It appears as though the parameters of the scheme will remain the same in terms of how much a person can claim back.PolicingThe number of new gardaí to be recruited is expected to rise from 500 to a new figure of 700.Business supportsThe Government has made it clear that it intends to phase out the pandemic unemployment payment but an extension to the business support known as EWSS (employment wage subsidy scheme) will be announced. There are indications that it may be needed all the way up to next summer but Ministers may find a middle ground and announce its extension until spring. The primary qualifying criteria for the EWSS is that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70 per cent of their previous turnover level and this is unlikely to change. The question is around how the scheme is recalibrated, or whether the subsidy rates change."},{"url":null,"title":"tactics of uk s brexit negotiating team deplorable ahern says","story":"The UK’s Brexit negotiator David Frost will on Tuesday set out Britain’s demands for changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol amid a stand-off with the EU over the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Photograph: Peter ByrnePA Wire Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern has described the tactics of the UK’s Brexit negotiating team as “deplorable”.The European Union was trying to find solutions to the situation while it looked like “the representative from the UK was out to do everything to make life almost impossible,” Mr Ahern told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny show.“He might think that’s very smart negotiation, but I think it’s deplorable. In normal business people just don’t do things like that,” Mr Ahern said.The protocol left Northern Ireland under some EU trade rules after Brexit to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Border checks on goods moving to Northern Ireland from Britain have angered unionists and led to a threat from the UK to suspend the arrangement.British Brexit negotiator David Frost is due to set out the UK objections to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the agreement in a speech in Lisbon on Tuesday, timed in advance of the EU’s publication of its proposals to overcome difficulties with the protocol.Downing Street has said the ECJ role in ensuring compliance with the rules of the protocol is “a central issue” for the UK, but Irish Government officials said that nobody in Northern Ireland had raised the ECJ as an issue.Mr Ahern said that while the UK had “rolled over a few with a few countries”, it had not signed any significant trade deals and was experiencing major problems with staffing and filling positions.People from other countries were gone, and this was affecting the UK and its budgetary situation. “On the day of our Budget where we’re spending €4.6 billion they have a paper out last night saying that they’re going to have cuts of several billion soon, in their Budget paper of next week.“They’re in a bad position from a trade point of view, it’s not in any one’s interest to see them in that position.“Somewhere along the way they might realise that Brexit was not at all a great position and then start trying to deal with the EU in a fair way.”Mr Ahern said that at the moment the Conservative party viewed “fighting and bashing the EU” as being tactically in their political interests, it was likely to continue as long as public opinion continued to think that this was a good way of dealing with diplomatic relationships. “Somewhere along the way” UK prime minister Boris Johnson might decide that it was “not such a great idea to be fighting with the EU.“Are the British stupid enough to go into a full trade war, that’s the question? I don’t think Boris is that silly, to go into a full trade war, the EU has a lot of weight of ways of really hurting the UK if it gets into that business”.FrustrationsMr Ahern said he understood Simon Coveney’s frustration at the leaking of information and that European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic must be very annoyed at efforts to undermine his work before it was presented.“Frost wanted a fresh deal out of the negotiations. That was not the way to handle the business because the EU’s document isn’t coming out until tomorrow and then what he did over the weekend was he started leaking parts of the speech he was going to make in Lisbon today, it’s not the way to carry on negotiations and it’s very unhelpful, but it is part of the continual process of what the British are at, I don’t think it’s too hard to work out what the game is.”The “whole game” with the UK was to try to “kick the can down the road”. They’ve been at it since 2016 and they’re at it again, Mr Ahern said.“I think they have it in their sights to get out of the Protocol altogether - Boris currently says privately that he was misled (by whom?) this is the question, he was negotiating with the EU, but I don’t think he took much part of the negotiations. He wasn’t negotiating with the Irish government, he was having meetings with them, but I don’t think the British have moved away from what the Protocol was designed or the Withdrawal Agreement was designed for, and that was to avoid a hard border between the UK and the Single Market operating in the Republic of Ireland. “What they are endeavouring to do is have a position where Northern Ireland is in the Single Market, but does not have to comply with any of the rules of the Single Market. In fairness to the EU, they’ve made it perfectly clear, regardless of where the border was, a land border or a sea border, you couldn’t have a position where you get the benefits of the Single Market without having to pay the checks and balances. That is the crux of the matter.”Mr Ahern said that he felt the issue of the European Court of Justice was a “red herring”, it was nothing new, it had been mentioned by the UK last July. “I think that’s a bit of a red herring in the whole debate - they know that if there’s a breakdown in the end somebody has to arbitrate and they know the European Court of Justice is the way that everything in Europe operates. They’re throwing that in knowing the EU will say no to that. “By his own admission Frost had committed to three weeks of intense negotiations to try and resolve the issues - he threw in the European Court of Justice knowing that was the one issue they wouldn’t deal with. Simon rightly said that was another red line they were throwing in, I honestly don’t believe ... that’s just trying to muddy the waters, we shouldn’t take it too serious I think.“Frost is a guy who is not trying to find solutions. Gove was a guy who was very good at finding solutions - that’s been his track record, like him or not. Frost just seems very good at taking the hardline Brexit position and he looks as if he’s determined to go on with that. Mr Ahern said he did not think the UK would trigger Article 16. “I think the Brexit argument is going to get worse not better. That argument will probably not take place this side of Christmas.“If there’s a trade war, either a selective one or a complete one in 2022 - that will not suit anybody, but Frost is pushing his luck on this.”"},{"url":null,"title":"moderate face of germany s afd steps down as party shifts further right","story":"AfD co-leader Jörg Meuthen (right) is standing down after losing a long-running power struggle with hardliners in the party. Photograph: Tobias Schwarz AFP via Getty Images)The co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has announced he is standing down, after losing a long-running power struggle with hardliners in the party.In a letter to AfD members on Monday, Jörg Meuthen (60) who is also a member of the European Parliament, said he would not be running again for party leader at internal elections in December.Mr Meuthen, a former economics professor, has been co-leader of the AfD since the summer of 2015 and represented its more moderate face.But he was increasingly at odds with other senior figures in the AfD, such as Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla, leaders of the party’s parliamentary group, who are backed by influential hardliners, particularly in eastern Germany. In his letter to party members, Mr Meuthen described an “incredibly demanding time” as leader that had been marked by “some hardships and disappointments”. He vowed, however, “neither to fall silent nor to stop my political work”, without specifying what that might be.Tensions and isions have riven the AfD for years. Mr Meuthen led a long-running campaign against “The Wing”, a hard-right movement within the party that was formed in 2015, and he was behind a successful attempt to expel one of The Wing’s most prominent members, Andreas Kalbitz, from the AfD in 2020.The Wing, which was classified by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency as a rightwing extremist organisation in 2020 and formally placed under observation, was dissolved by the AfD executive board that same year. But another of its founders, Björn Höcke, head of the AfD in the central state of Thuringia, remains an influential force.The AfD began as a Eurosceptic party but used anxiety over the 2015 influx of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, mostly from war-torn Syria, to ride a populist wave into parliament. It became the Bundestag’s largest opposition party.But its fortunes waned amid shifting public concerns during the coronavirus pandemic and its very public isions. Its regional branches in Thuringia, Saxony, and several other states are under local surveillance by the domestic intelligence agency.Public splitThe party attempted to latch on to protest movements against the coronavirus lockdown as well as vaccine sceptic groups. It failed to leverage that alignment into better results in last month’s national elections, where its share of the vote fell to 10.3 per cent from 12.5 per cent in 2017.The election outcome led to a very public split between Mr Meuthen on the one hand and Ms Weidel and Mr Chrupalla on the other. At a press conference after the vote, Mr Meuthen pointed to the nationwide results as proof of the need for a more moderate course, using the moment to skewer his more rightwing rivals and argue the party had “significant acceptance problems” with mainstream voters.Ms Weidel and Mr Chrupalla said they were satisfied by the results, arguing they were being misrepresented in the media. Ms Weidel argued the media “juiced the Greens to the top”. The Greens came in third with 14.8 per cent, after the centre-left Social Democrats in first and Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats in second.Yet one aspect of last month’s elections suggest the party could continue to drift further to the right.The best AfD results were in Thuringia, where it garnered more votes than any other party for the first time – 24 per cent. The AfD also came out top in Saxony, with 24.3 per cent.Hardline party figures see the electoral results as proof that Mr Meuthen’s approach failed. They argued that they adopted the more moderate style he called for in the campaign, using softer speaking voices in stump speeches and less aggressive campaign posters under the slogan “Germany. But normal.”Mr Meuthen is not the first AfD leader to step aside over similar disputes. In 2017, the then party leader Frauke Petry stepped down immediately after the Bundestag election, also over concerns that it was not distancing itself enough from hardline nationalists. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"false positive lateral flow tests children double week","story":"The amount of false positive coronavirus lateral flow tests has increased in secondary school children, official data show.Anecdotal evidence of children receiving a positive lateral flow and then a negative follow-up PCR have circulated on social media and numbers from the UK Health Security Agency indicates the phenomenon is indeed on the rise.Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the newly-minted UKHSA, has said the body is aware of the trend and is “looking into the cause”.Figures from Test and Trace, which used to be controlled by the Department of Health and now falls under the remit of the UKHSA, reveal that in the week ending September 22, almost 620,000 students took lateral flow tests at home as part of routine asymptomatic screening and almost 14,000 came back positive.However, 1,112 (8 per cent) of these pupils returned a negative or void follow-up PCR, indicating the lateral test result was a false positive.One week later around 580,000 secondary school students took a lateral flow test and almost 16,000 were found to be positive.Of these tests, 87 per cent (13,863) were later confirmed via PCR, with 13 per cent — or around one in eight — coming back as negative or void.The reason for the surge in positive lateral flow test results in children remains unknown, with Dr Kit Yates, a Senior Lecturer in Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath, saying it could be down to any one of myriad factors, including faulty lateral flow tests, children manipulating the test to get out of school, or a mathematical quirk brought about by the sheer volume of tests being done.In an article for The Conversation, the member of Independent Sage explains: “Understanding whether there’s something truly wrong or whether this is just a mathematical artefact has significant ramifications – for testing, contact tracing and the monitoring of the UK’s current Covid situation.“The UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) chief medical adviser, Susan Hopkins, has noted that the organisation is looking into the issue.“The UKHSA acknowledges that it doesn’t have an explanation as yet but is investigating because it has “not experienced this before to such a degree”.More from NewsWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?October\u0026#39s Hunter\u0026#39s Moon: when it will peak in the UK and full moon dates for 2021Bologna bombing: Newly found tourist footage finally gives families hope for justiceBelarus risks Kremlin\u0026#39s wrath after \u0026#39abducting\u0026#39 pro-Putin journalist from MoscowCoveney has some cheek accusing Britain of risking a \u0026#39breakdown in relations\u0026#39 with the EUMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gp phone consultations recorded face to face appointments","story":"Telephone consultations with GPs are being incorrectly classed as “face-to-face” appointments in official statistics, NHS chiefs have admitted, following an investigation by The .In recent weeks, ministers, including the Prime Minister, have intervened to promise patients access to face-to-face appointments, amid mounting concern about the difficulties some are facing.Before the pandemic, about 80 per cent of consultations took place in a doctor’s surgery. However, the latest monthly figure is just 58 per cent, with little change since officials vowed in May to give all patients the right to a “face-to-face” appointment.Now, The  can reveal that even this figure exaggerates the number of consultations which are actually taking place in person.NHS officials said that because of the way some local systems were set up, some appointments were automatically being logged as face-to-face slots, regardless of how they were actually delivered.  Anne Bedish, a  reader, viewed her own patient record online, and was surprised to see that all the telephone appointments she had in the past year had been recorded as “face-to-face” consultations.The 68-year-old, who suffers from a number of health problems and was on the Government’s clinically vulnerable list, had 12 phone appointments in the past year, which she found had been classed as “face-to-face” visits.When she contacted Glenlyn Medical Practice, in East Molesey, Surrey, to question the miscategorisation, they confirmed that the appointments had been by telephone, but the record went unchanged.NHS Digital, which publishes national data on GP appointments every month, suggested this pattern could occur far more widely, because of the way data has been recorded.Officials said: “We do acknowledge that there may be data quality issues with the data and instances where the data may not be a true representation of what may be happening in all practices. “From March 2020, face-to-face appointment mode data may not be entirely reflective of what happens in the practices, as appointment types have been assigned to appointment modes prior to the pandemic.“Thus, even if the appointment was carried out through a different mode, the appointment registers as a face-to-face appointment on the system.”Officials said this was most likely to happen if appointments had been set up in advance as a “block booking of appointments” and was most likely to affect cases early on in the pandemic.However, neither of these were the case for Mrs Bedish, whose most recent appointments occurred less than a month ago.Dennis Reed, the director of Silver Voices, a campaign group for the over-60s, said: “This needs to be investigated. How many of the figures have been fiddled in this way? It is really worrying. “I know that practices are under a lot of pressure to increase the number of patients getting a face-to-face appointment, and it worries me that we could see more and more of this.”It came as it emerged that the proportion of GP home visits have almost halved since before the pandemic. NHS figures show that while pre-Covid roughly one per cent of all GP appointments were home visits, in July and August they amounted to 0.6 per cent.Home visits are crucial for the housebound, elderly and dying, campaigners warned, although senior medical figures have been calling for the practice to be scrapped for decades.On Monday, a grieving husband claimed that his cancer-stricken late wife would still be alive if her GP had agreed to pay a home visit.Anton, the father-of-three from Bromley, south-east London, told LBC Radio he had begged a doctor to visit his 44-year-old spouse but a nurse was sent instead, who allegedly checked only her pulse and temperature.He said that by the time his wife went to hospital, her cancer had spread to her brain.According to NHS figures for August, there were 151,627 home visits paid in England, down from 157,998 in July.Patients’ groups and campaigners have warned that many vulnerable people have been unable to access care, with coroners linking a string of deaths to remote appointments.In May, health officials promised to scrap a system of “total triage” introduced during the pandemic, and give patients the right to choose to see a doctor in person.However, last month the head of the Royal College of General Practitioners told MPs there was no point making such promises when GPs did not have the capacity to meet them.But the Prime Minister insisted patients were entitled to be able to see a doctor who could give “proper hands-on understanding” of their problems.Boris Johnson said: “I am absolutely certain that unless we can deliver that there will be people sadly whose symptoms are not picked up and who will suffer as a result.”Mrs Bedish said: “It really worries me that this data is giving a misleading picture of how many patients are actually getting a face-to-face appointment with their doctor, and allowing ministers to claim the situation is improving.“I have no problem with my GP practice. Some of my appointments, like one for a skin condition, would have been better face-to-face. But my concern really is about the national data, and how it’s claiming most appointments are happening in person when it doesn’t seem that way at all.”NHS Digital said that the data was “experimental” and only provides an indication of GP activity, as it was pulled from GP practice systems, which record data as they see fit, rather than answering specific questions such as mode of appointment.Caveats published with the monthly data state: “The mode of the appointment shows the setting of the consultation. For example, face-to-face, telephone, home visit, etc. This is set locally by the practices so may not represent the actual care setting of the appointment. For example, some video conference appointments may be logged by the practice as face-to-face.”More from NewsWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?October\u0026#39s Hunter\u0026#39s Moon: when it will peak in the UK and full moon dates for 2021Bologna bombing: Newly found tourist footage finally gives families hope for justiceBelarus risks Kremlin\u0026#39s wrath after \u0026#39abducting\u0026#39 pro-Putin journalist from MoscowCoveney has some cheek accusing Britain of risking a \u0026#39breakdown in relations\u0026#39 with the EUMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sally rooney refuses allow new novel published hebrew due views","story":"Sally Rooney, the acclaimed Irish author, has reportedly refused to allow her new novel to be published in Hebrew due to her views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The disclosure was made in a recent newspaper interview which said that Rooney had turned down a translation bid from Modan, an Israeli publisher, as she supports a boycott of Israel.Rooney\u0027s new novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You, was released in September and quickly topped book charts in the UK and Ireland.When Modan approached Rooney\u0027s agent in an attempt to sign another translation deal, the agent announced that Rooney supports the cultural boycott movement on Israel and therefore does not approve translation into Hebrew, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.The interview with Rooney was published by the New York Times in September, but was then translated into Hebrew and published by Haaretz with additional details.Haaretz added that Rooney\u0027s agent, Tracy Bohan, confirmed that the author had declined the translation when approached for comment.The  approached both Rooney\u0027s agent and Modan, the Israeli publisher, on Monday night but did not immediately receive a response.Rooney\u0027s two previous novels, Conversations With Friends and Normal People, have both been published in Hebrew by Modan.Rooney, 30, has previously been outspoken about her opposition to Israel\u0027s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, which the Palestinians claim as their own land.She recently signed an open letter which called for an end to the support provided by global powers to Israel and its military especially the United States”, and also urged governments to “cut trade, economic and cultural relations”.In a report on Monday night, the Jewish ic Agency also noted that in her second novel, Normal People, the main characters attend a protest against Israel\u0027s role in the 2014 Gaza war.The boycott revelation - which was not mentioned in the original New York Times article - was brought to light in a blog post by Gitit Levy-Paz on the website Forward.Rooney’s decision surprised and saddened me. I am a Jewish and Israeli woman, but I am also a literary scholar who believes in the universal power of art, she wrote.Ben Judah, a British author and journalist, also condemned the decision. Depressing and unpleasant that Sally Rooney won’t allow her new novel to be translated into Hebrew, he wrote on Twitter.All three of Rooney\u0027s novels have been showered with praise by critics for her minimalist writing style and melancholy depiction of life in post-financial crisis Ireland. The novels also address tensions between Ireland\u0027s working and middle classes.In the UK she has received four book awards, including Young Writer of the Year by the Sunday Times in 2017 and the Costa Book award in 2018.Normal People, which follows the on-off relationship between Marianne Sheridan and Connell Waldron during their youth, was adapted into an acclaimed BBC series in 2020.In an interview with The  in 2018, Rooney said that she struggled with socialising while growing up, despite her newfound status as the voice of the so-called millennial generation.I thought school was immensely boring and, as a teenager, I often found social life quite mystifying…I was not someone to whom it came easily to be charming, she said.A spokesman for Modan confirmed that it would not be publishing Rooney\u0027s third novel but declined to say whether this was due to a boycott, and instead referred The  to Rooney\u0027s agent.More from NewsWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?October\u0026#39s Hunter\u0026#39s Moon: when it will peak in the UK and full moon dates for 2021Bologna bombing: Newly found tourist footage finally gives families hope for justiceBelarus risks Kremlin\u0026#39s wrath after \u0026#39abducting\u0026#39 pro-Putin journalist from MoscowCoveney has some cheek accusing Britain of risking a \u0026#39breakdown in relations\u0026#39 with the EUMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"retain explain compromise far","story":"Were you foolish enough to be taken in? Did the weasel phrase ‘Retain and Explain’ mislead you? Of course not. You also realised that this would mean a different kind of shame for our nation’s past, your past, my past, and therefore our memory for the future.It was a fudge of course, a palliative intended as a sop to the mobs which were protesting belligerently on our streets, tearing down statues and throwing them into rivers. It was  motivated by the fear of a wave that could proliferate from Bristol and into the streets of other English towns. But the plaque placed under the Rhodes statue at Oriel College, Oxford yesterday morning, demonstrates the futility of the idea of institutional explanation. The three paragraphs offer little information, one indeed being a simple instance of buck-passing: ‘In June 2020, Oriel College declared its wish to remove the statue but is not doing so following legal and regulatory advice.’Well, that is a real case of intellectual achievement, as well as an excuse for vandalism averted. But there are other gems: ‘Some of his activities led to great loss of life and attracted criticism in his day and ever since.’ That, of course, would work for very many. Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist, as were many around the world at the time, including Africans, notably Menelik II of Abyssinia but he is of note in Oriel and Oxford as a whole as a benefactor of great generosity and imagination. We all know this is more complex than the plaque-writers (a new career for the ambitious second-rater) suggest. Indeed, if any institution wishes to try to explain the historical nuances of any inidual statue it would require many pages and much complexity. And still few would be delighted. This is the beauty of historical study - a perpetual debate, an ongoing discussion, the very antithesis of three dull paragraphs shafted into a railing under the Rhodes statue. Surely, it is better for iniduals to research the ‘lessons’ of a statue for themselves and to consider what, if anything, it means to them rather than being dictated to. Rather than ‘Retain and Explain’ we should ‘Retain’ and leave any explanation outside the institutional maw.The culture in too many British institutions at present is one of fear and concession. Fear of the threat of revolution against traditions and customs this country has practiced for generations, and concession to the revolutionaries. Under this pressure, state-sanctioned explanations of the past become a diatribe against it. Overtly political in nature, they lead to a failure to grasp the more interesting dimensions of many historical questions. The problem is compounded by a Government obsessed with short-term fixes - eager to avoid bad headlines in the days ahead rather than preserving our great institutions for the future. Introducing Retain and Explain may have helped stop the protests, but it now threatens to leave a permanent stain on great buildings and under beautiful statues. Why should we condemn admirers of Oxford and all it stands for - intellectualism, open debate - to shoddy three paragraph ‘explainers’, because a few radicals threatened to take matters into their own hands? We have given in to the mob far too easily.

The study, from the cross-party Science and Technology Committee and the Health and Social Care Committee, said the UK’s preparation for a pandemic was far too focused on flu, while ministers waited too long to push through lockdown measures in early . In a wide-ranging report, MPs said the UK’s pandemic planning was too “narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model” that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. Here are eight key findings from the report:Preparedness The Governmentaposs pandemic planning was too narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. The national risk register predicted that the likelihood of an emerging infectious disease spreading within the UK was lower than that of a flu pandemic, with only up to  people dying. The report recommended that experts from abroad should help draw up plans while specialists should scan the horizon for future threats. Army logistics experts should play a more central role in preparing for pandemics. Herd immunity While allowing people to become infected early on to reach herd immunity was not an official Government strategy, there was a policy approach of fatalism about the spread of the virus. This led to a strategy of only trying to moderate the speed of infection through the population - flattening the curve - rather than stopping its spread. SAGE experts believed completely suppressing the virus would cause a second peak.Lockdowns Ministers took a gradual and incremental approach to restrictions such as social distancing, isolation and lockdowns and MPs said it was astonishing that it took so long for them to realise this was a catastrophically wrong decision that would dramatically increase the death toll. There was a  belief the public would not accept a lockdown and lack of testing meant there was little data on Covid spread. Ministers ignored scientic advice for a two-week circuit breaker in autumn which could have saved thousands of lives and meant there was a month-long lockdown - apart from schools - in November instead. The PM announced a third lockdown on January  . Restrictions The Government was too slow to bring in self-isolation rules while light-touch border controls only on countries with high Covid rates meant the arrival of more cases from countries like France and Spain. Regional tiers brought in last October were not watertight enough to prevent infection spreading. Scientic evidence for measures like the pm curfew on pubs was lacking. Tougher social distancing measures last autumn could have stopped the spread of the Alpha iant across the country and saved more lives.  Social care Social care had a less prominent voice in Government in the early stages of the pandemic than did the NHS. The decision not to test people being discharged from hospitals to care homes early on was a failure and led to deaths in care homes. Staff shortages, the lack of testing and dficulties in obtaining PPE all hampered isolation and infection control. The social care sector remains drastically in need of funding and reform - or it will be at risk from future pandemics. Health inequalities There were unacceptably high death rates among people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, the MPs concluded. Increased exposure to Covid as a result of peopleaposs housing and working conditions played a signicant role. BAME staff in the NHS, often in more junior positions, faced greater dficulty getting appropriate PPE equipment. There were also disproportionately high mortality rates among people with learning dficulties and autism - in part because of pre-existing health conditions but also dficulties accessing care. The experience of the covid pandemic underlines the need for an urgent and long term strategy to tackle health inequalities, they concluded.  Testing The slow, uncertain, and often chaotic performance of the £ billion test, trace and isolate system severely hampered the UKaposs response to the pandemic, the MPs found. Test and trace failed in its stated objective to prevent future lockdowns - despite vast quantities of taxpayersapos money. The report concluded were it not for the NHS vaccines programme further lockdown restrictions would have been needed in summer . Vaccines MPs praised ministers for identying that a vaccine would be a long-term route out of the pandemic and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance for setting up the Vaccines Taskforce to procure jabs. The Government was right to support vaccine research and development, including the Oxford AstraZeneca jab, while the NHS successfully handled the roll-out of the programme, with over % of the adult population jabbed by September . But the conclusion that the vaccine programme has redeemed many of the Governmentaposs other failings - which resulted in , deaths - will be controversial.

CF Fertilisers, Britain’s main carbon dioxide producer, was forced to close down two of its UK plants - Cheshire and Billingham - last month following the rising price of gas. The shortage had a major impact on numerous industries because CO is needed to stun animals for slaughter, produce fizzy drinks, extend the shelf le of food, help surgical operations and cool nuclear power plants. In September, the government agreed to spend millions of pounds on bailing out CF Fertilisers – a private US firm – so that it could restart production at the Teesside factory.  Ministers have now brokered a longer-term deal, lasting until January, which will allow the plant to charge signicantly more for CO in the coming months to ensure production remains viable.It is unclear how much more companies will have to paybut food producers could face a possible fivefold spike in the cost of CO that could ultimately impact food prices.It comes as retail industry experts warned that shoppers could face “disruption and frustration” over the festive period amid empty shelves as hundreds of thousands of people have started to stockpile groceries for Christmas.According to the , there is speculation that prices of CO could jump from £ to as much as £, a tonne. The British Meat Processors Association said: The industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward. We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work.” The deal was welcomed by Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, but he added: The increased cost of buying CO is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. “This will of course add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners.  Carbon dioxide is a by-product of fertiliser manufacture and CF supplies around  per cent of the UK’s needs. Following the government’s new deal, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said “critical industries can have confidence in their supplies of CO over the coming months without further taxpayer support.” But there are fears that yesterday’s announcement does not address the industry’s dependency on a small number of companies that are at the mercy of gas prices.The UK is facing a cost of living crisis, with inflation having seen a record spike in August. In addition, the coronavirus pandemic has heavily impacted global supply chains.It comes a day after the boss of Kraft Heinz – the world’s fth-largest food and drink company –warned people will have to get used to higher food prices.Supermarket bosses in the UK – which faces the dual shock of Brexit and the pandemic – have recently warned of worsening conditions for consumers, such as rising prices and emptier shelves.Despite the rise in food and energy prices, the government has pushed ahead with scrapping the £-per-week universal credit uplt introduced during the pandemic. The government said: CO suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer.

When his mistake was pointed out, he was claimed to have said to have told guests: “They all look the same to me” - something Mr Gray denies.Fty invited guests - who included Labour leader Keir Starmer - had been watching Mr Gray onstage when it is claimed he made the comment.Mr Zahawi was said to have immediately had a private conversation with his fellow Tory MP following his remark.What do you think to this story  Let us know in the comments  Mr Javid had not yet arrived when the incident happened, only turning up later for photos. Mr Gray had been hosting the reception on September  to thank volunteers and frontline staff for their efforts during the Covid pandemic. A St John Ambulance spokesman told the Mirror: “St John does not tolerate racism in any way, shape or form. “We spoke with James Gray following the event about our values as an open, inclusive and progressive charity.” The Mirror understands the charity had already asked the MP to “stand down from all St John Ambulance activity”. Calls to Mr Gray’s mobile phone went to voicemail tonight.But he told MailOnline he had not said, “They all look the same to me”, but admitted confusing the two ministers.

Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay failed to say sorry more than a dozen times after MPs described the response to the pandemic as one of the worst ever public health failures. The damning probe by the Commons Health and Science committees found ministers made a “serious error” by moving too slowly into lockdowns last year.Experts said the , death toll in the first wave could have been cut in halfBoris Johnson had locked down a week earlier in March .Askedhe wanted to apologise by Sky Newsapos Kay Burley, Mr Barclay said: Weaposve followed throughout the scientic advice. We got the vaccine deployed extremely quickly, we protected our NHS from the surge of cases but of coursethere are lessons to learn we are keen to do so.  Pressed again on whether he was keen to apologise, he replied: “Well, no, we followed the scientic advice. We followed the scientic advice, we protected the NHS, we took the decisions based on the evidence before us. “But of course, we’ve always said with something so unprecedented as the pandemic, there will be lessons to learn. We’re keen to learn them - that’s why we’ve committed to an inquiry and that will be the opportunity to look at what could be done dferently and what lessons we take into the future. He also admitted that he hadnapost read the report in full. In another interview with LBC, Mr Barclay said he recognised the devastation to families but the decisions were based on the information they had at the time. Asked for an apology to those who lost relatives during the pandemic, he said: Well I recognise itaposs devastating and my heart goes out to any family, any of your listeners where they lost a loved one. Mr Barclay was asked eight times to apologise during the LBC interview. Bereaved families of some of the , people who died during the pandemic said the report was a “painful confirmation” that their loved ones need not have died. Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “Although this report falls well short of holding those in power during the pandemic to account, it still manages to identy clear and catastrophic mistakes which led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.” Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyNHSPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Oakhill secure training centre in Milton Keynes houses  boys aged between  and . In a monitoring report into the facility by Ofsted, the Prison Inspectorate and the Care Quality Commission warns “widespread failings” are having a “signicant impact” on the care and well-being of child inmates.Children have spent approximately  hours per day on average locked in their rooms, increasing to  hours on some days, according to records published by the centre. Inspectors have also raised concerns over the accuracy of the data, indicating the time the boys have spent in their rooms could be higher than what is being reported by the centre, the Independent reports. It comes just  months after the same inspectors issued an urgent warning to another secure training centre in England after it emerged children were being locked up for -and-a-half hours a day. Furthermore, it also came out that children at the centre in Rainsbrook, Rugby, were subjected to a spartan regime. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.In June, the government removed all  children living in that centre to other custodial settings. The then-justice secretary Robert Buckland said he had “left with no choice” due to the “very serious failings” at Rainsbrook. Campaigners have said the recent bombshell Oakhill report should be the “final straw” and that secure training centres be shut down to ensure children in trouble are “given the care and support they need. Anna McMorrin MP, shadow minister for victims and youth justice, said there was an “alarming pattern of failure” across the youth justice system and accused ministers of “repeatedly failed to act on past warnings”. She told the Independent: It is time for the government to commission an independent review of youth custody, as Labour has called for, to get a grip on this spiralling crisis. The new report also notes how temperatures in children’s living units and in other parts of Oakhill were “too high”, leading to an environment during the summer months that is “not conducive to positive care”. The report states: There was no means of cooling the children’s living units or staff administration areas. This makes living and working at the centre very uncomfortable at best. Inspectors were told by children that activities were cancelled last minute - usually because there wasnapost enough staff. Furthermore, minimal staffing levels during July and August  were not met Staff told inspectors that morale was “very low” and that they did not feel supported by managers. The report notes: “The way in which centre staff encourage children to develop positive behaviours and social skills is in disarray.” Inspectors conclude that children’s day-to-day experiences are “very poor” and that “little progress has been made” since similar concerns were raised by inspectors in May . Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “The distressing realities revealed in this inspection report echo what the Howard League has seen through its own legal work with children in custody during the pandemic and before, with boys locked in their cells for hours on end without fresh air or face-to-face education. He added: This report on Oakhill should be the final straw. It is time to close the secure training centres and ensure that boys and girls in trouble are given the care and support they need.” A spokesperson for Oakhill told the Independent the safety of children was “paramount”. They added: “Earlier this year, staff numbers at Oakhill were severely depleted by the impact of Covid- as signicant numbers of staff were required, under prevailing regulations, to self-isolate at home. “In these unprecedented circumstances, managers at Oakhill had to adopt a restricted operating regime, including remote learning for children from their rooms.” They said that since the Ofsted visit, Oakhill’s operating regime for children had “improved” and that over the past month children had been able to spend on average  hours out of their rooms daily and education in classrooms had been “restored”.

The mum-of-two has waived her right to anonymity to share how police allegedly laughed at her when she reported the incident in Greenwich, London,  years ago. Emma Wilson, also known as Emma B and currently working for Magic FM, described how she had dropped off her then five-year-old at school and was walking with her baby son in the pram when the horric incident occurred. She said Couzens, who between December  and September  was working as a Special Constable for Kent Police, had shouted hey at her, at which point she turned around and saw him exposing himself.

She called  but officers found her allegations funny.In an interview with The , she said she decided to speak out when pictures of Couzens emerged after he raped and brutally killed Ms Everard.I really wouldnapost say anything out loudI wasnapost very sure, because itaposs important and itaposs serious, but as soon as I saw the pictures of him, I said aposThataposs himapos, she said. Speaking of the moment she reported the exposure to the police, she said: They laughed when I was describing the graphic bits and what he was doing, they thought that bit was particularly funny.

The Met Police are now investigating the incident, according to the . The depraved cop jailed for killing Sarah Everard is already facing a fresh probe over a sexual assault on a drag queen, who made a formal complaint against him last Tuesday.The performer told the Mirror he was in costume when Couzens allegedly started molesting him while he stood at a bar in Deal, Kent – then propositioned him to have sex in a dark alley.And he claims the evil father-of-two even brazenly told him he was a police officer when he told him to stop. More claims about Couzens have emerged since he was given a full-le prison sentence last month for the rape and murder of Sarah.  He is alleged to have taken a prostitute to a wedding anniversary party because his we could not make it. On another occasion, it is claimed an escort turned up at his police ­station demanding cash from him. Couzens served with Kent Police from  to  and joined the Civil Nuclear Constabulary in , then London’s Met force in .

Police were told a man had been spotted driving naked from the waist down – but no action was taken. There were also reports Couzens indecently exposed himself twice in a McDonald’s car park in Swanley, Kent, just days before kidnapping Sarah. The Met said the crime was “allocated for investigation” but not concluded by the time Sarah was killed. It added it would “re-evaluate our approach to indecent exposure”.

Mr Reck says he now suffers from anxiety after the incidentTeesside Magistrates Court heard that Mark Donnison ripped down the fence and stamped on it before attacking James Reck Image: MDMByKristy DawsonShiler Mahmoudi:,  Oct | commentsA man who ripped down his neighbouraposs fence and assaulted him following a -year row over the boundary line has been fined. Mark Donnison, , tore down two fence  between his home and his neighbour James Reckaposs house, before then attacking him, Teesside Magistratesapos Court heard. He broke the fence up into bits and stamped on it before crossing the boundary line and attacking Mr Reck, who recorded the incident on his phone on May .It comes after the neighbours disputed the boundary line between them for  years, Teesside Live reports. Prosecutor Ian Martin told the court: The defendant had taken it upon himself to pull down the witnessapos fence and then to further break up bits of it, stamp all over it before effectively invading over the property line to assault the victim in this case.  Itaposs all captured on mobile phone footage. The court was shown the footage that shows Donnison, a factory operative, crossing the line into Mr Reckaposs garden and appearing to attack him.  In the background of the video, a woman can be heard shouting look what you have done and get off my husband. In a victim statement, Mr Reck said: The amount of stress following it has been a nightmare. My stress levels have been heightened. Selling our property and waiting to complete the sale - itaposs increased my anxiety and Iaposm not a person who usually suffers therefore I know this has been a knock on effect. Donnison, from Billingham pleaded guilty to criminal damage to property valued under £,, as the two fence  were valued at £ each, and assault by beating.  Paul Watson, defending, told the court: Mr and Mrs Reck have moved from the property, he has no idea where they have gone. Also what is not noted is this - thereaposs actually two fences attached to each other so Mr and Mrs Reck had, without permission of Mr Donnison, attached their fence to his - screwed theirs to it. He went on to say that an ongoing dispute had existed between the neighbours for  years and Mr and Mrs Reck refused to compromise with Donnison. Mr Watson told the court how that his client had lost his temper after the Recks refused to compromise. He said: Afterwards Mr Donnison erected the fence on the proper line therefore the situation was resolved.  He accepts that he went too far. He went on to add: Thereaposs clear knee from him into the leg of Mr Donnison which doesnapost help the situation. Twelve years he would say of provocation. The neighbours have gone. He doesnapost know where they have gone to thataposs not going to continue and he replaced the fence at his own expense. District Judge Mark Daley asked Mr Watson: Has the -year dispute been about the boundary the whole time   Mr Watson replied: Unfortunately yes sir. Thereaposs been reports by Mr Donnison to police, especially when a sign was put up and he asked the Recks to remove it which they did. Reports by the Recks against Mr Donnison and his partner. Not everyday but on enough occasions to cause an affect with the mental health of Mr Donnison. District Judge Daley told Donnison: You pleaded guilty to these offences at the first opportunity. I have taken that into account, along with the fact you are, until now, a man with no previous convictions. This is an offence which does merit some kind of punishment, Iaposm going to deal with that by way of a financial penalty. The judge fined Donnison £ and ordered him to pay £ compensation to his former neighbour. He also ordered the defendant to pay £ prosecution costs and a £ surcharge.

There had been suggestions the couple wouldto Britain to have their four-month-old baptised at Windsor Castle like their son Archie, two. Lilibet Diana, affectionately known as Lili and who is named after the Queen and after Harryaposs mum Diana, was born in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calornia in June.But a palace insider told the: “There will not be a christening in the UK. It is not happening.Another source said it would be “highly unlikely”.  Instead, Lilibet is likely to be christened into the Episcopal Church of the US, a member church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. If baptised in Calornia, she would not automatically be considered a member of the Church of England, unless she came to Britain and joined a CofE congregation. Anyone can say they are a member of the Church of Englandthey worship in a CofE church and are not a member of an incompatible religion.A member of the Royal Family does not need to be baptised to remain in the line of succession.In , Meghan Markle was baptised and confirmed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a secret service at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace.Holy water from the River Jordan from the private Royal Family font was poured on Meghanaposs head in the ceremony and The Chapel Royal choir of six Gentlemen-in-Ordinary and ten Children of the Chapel performed throughout the service, it was claimed.  The Sussexes stirred controversy with their first child Archieaposs christening as they kept the ceremony private.In August, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliamstold Express:Harry and Meghan’s relations with the British press went badly downhill when Archie was christened in private and the names of the godparents were not released.”He continued: It must be likely that she will be christened in Calornia though there were rumours of a possible christening at Windsor.” Mr Fitzwilliams said: It seems certain that her christening will be in Meghan’s home state and with the secrecy but without the controversy that surrounded Archie’s christening. It comes after a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed the couple will not be flying back to the UK for a party in honour of Princess Diana.  Around  people are expected to attend the bash at Kensington Palace on October , with Diana’s old friend Sir Elton John said to be on the guest list. The celebration has been organised to thank donors for funding a commemorative statue of Diana which now sits in Kensington Palace’s Sunken Garden. It was previously reported that royal aides were preparing for Meghan and Harry to make a surprisefor the bash. Harry has ed to the UK on only two occasions since moving to the US, namely for his granddadaposs Philipaposs funeral and for the unveiling of Dianaaposs statue on what wouldaposve been her th birthday. Meghan stayed at home on both occasions, mainly on medical grounds as she was heavily pregnant when the funeral took place in April.

He was jailed in  following a DNA breakthroughJohn McGlynn is back on the streetsByTom Pettor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct A rapist linked by a former det­ective to crimes by the Night Stalker is now back on the streets after  years in jail. John McGlynn was convicted of rape, another serious sexual offence, burglary and  imprisonment over the  attack on an -year-old widow. McGlynn, now , was one of two men who had subjected victim “Rose” to a four-hour ordeal. He was jailed in  following a DNA breakthrough. His finger and palm marks also matched those left at Rose’s home. Sources now say that McGlynn, of Darlington, Co Durham, was released last year under licence, two-thirds into his -year term.  Rose, who died before McGlynn was caught, told police two men had broken into her home in Beckenham, in the heart of the Night Stalker’s hunting ground in South East London. And former detective Colin Sutton, upon whose career ITV drama Manhunt is based, believes Night Stalker Delroy Grant – who he helped catch in  after a -year reign of terror – may be the second man. Rose told police that one attacker was black, shone a torch in her eyes, soothed her and gave her water — as Grant often did with his victims.  Grant and McGlynn were both sexually attracted to elderly women and had once lived in Leicester at the same time. Mr Sutton, who is played by Martin Clunes in the TV hit, makes his claims about the pair in his book Operation Minstead, which was the basis for the second series of Manhunt screened last month.In it, he writes: “I think there is a sequence of events that would fitwith the evidence and explain the surprising inconsistencies in this shocking case...“Delroy Grant and John McGlynn knew each other in the mid-s and discovered they had a shared attraction to elderly ladies.” Mr Sutton also said the “striking similarities with Grant’s modus operandi were utterly convincing”. And he fears the pair could be behind more crimes on top of the  already linked to Grant, who is currently serving four le terms for  offences.

The article hails the ocean as the best natural solution we have to climate change on the planet.She also praised the environmental work being done on Ascension Island, a United Kingdom overseas territory that lies , miles off the coast of Africa, reports theExpress .“If the rest of the world were to follow Ascension’s example, we could see fish stocks recovering and carbon-absorbing habitats reviving within a few years – all with the potential to mitigate climate change,” she wrote. There is only one ocean. The challenges it faces are sadly man-made and most can be turned aroundwe act now.  If we work together to protect it, the ocean will protect us – in perpetuity. Ascension, which is a volcanic island, is just  square kilometres in size and has a population of around  people. Despite its tiny size, the island is home to a ground-breaking initiative aiming to protect oceans. The Blue Marine Foundation and its Great British Oceans Coalition partners are aiming to protect .% of the island’s waters. The princess’ article will appear in the special th anniversary edition of Spear’s Magazine, which has been produced in partnership with the Blue Marine Foundation. Her plea comes just weeks after Harry and Meghan Markle met with UN deputy secretary-general Amina Mohammed at UN headquarters in New York to talk about climate change.After the meeting, Mohammed said they discussed how to engage on issues we care about deeply, such as vaccine equity, climate action, the economic empowerment of women, youth engagement and mental wellbeing.However, thepair were slammedfor later using a private jet tohome to their £million home in Calornia. Former government minister Norman Baker, , told Newsweek : Itaposs completely hypocritical for Prince Harry or other members of the royal family to lecture people about climate change when theyaposre emitting more carbon than almost everyone  on the planet.People using private jets are in the top one percent of carbon emitters in the world. Prince Harry needs to stop using private jets orhe wants to use private jets, he needs to stop lecturing people on climate change,” Baker said. It is not particularly challenging to get a flight from New York to Calornia - people do it all the time. His criticism comes after the couple reportedly used  private jets in two years.William has also urged the public to work to safeguard the planet with hisEarthshot initiative.Comment MORE ON We CareUnited NationsMeghan MarklePrince HarryNorman BakerRoyal FamilyClimate changePrivate jets\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair married in a grand ceremony at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in  with her ied guest list including her grandmother the Queen, supermodel Cara Delevigne and singer Robbie Williams.In fact, more than  people packed into the chapel exactly three years ago to see Eugenie and Jack exchange their vows.Butyou look closely enough at pictures from the day you can see one prime seat at the front of the chapel in front of the Queen was left empty. However, it wasnapost down to a no-show on the big day - it is actually down to the Queen herself. Thataposs because traditionally the Queen and the rest of the royals sit on the right-hand-side of the quire in St Georgeaposs Chapel.Her Majesty is said to prefer to sit in the second row of seats, as, according to The Sun, she finds the front row uncomfortable.

Click here to sign up .And with tradition dictating that no one is allowed to sit in front of the Queen and obstruct her view - this is why the seat was left empty.The same seat was also left empty months earlier when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married in the same chapel. However, there was actually a member of the royal family missing on Eugenieaposs wedding day - the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, she attended a school harvest festival in Scotland, which she had agreed to make an appearance at before Eugenieaposs wedding date had been confirmed.Since marrying in , Eugenie and Jack have moved into Frogmore Cottage in Windsor and earlier this year welcomed their first child - a son called August Philip. And in a sweet moment in a documentary that aired last month honouring Eugenieaposs late grandfather Prince Philip, she revealed young August got to meet his great-grandfather shortly before his death in April.August was born on February  this year and holding back the tears, Eugenie explained: We named August, August Philip because grandpa has been such a huge, inspiring character in my le. I brought little August to come and meet him and told him that we had named him after him and it was such a lovely moment. We were very lucky to do that. Last month, Eugenie also became an aunt for the first time after her sister Princess Beatrice gave birth to a daughter she named Sienna Elizabeth.

The Queen, , was spotted using the same walking stick back in January , when she used it to assist her walking following a knee operation but has rarely been seen using one. Her Majesty was handed the stick after stepping from her state limousine, and appeared to be moving freely as she walked to her seat for the start of the service.  She used the stick again as she left. It is believed to be the first time she has used a walking aid at a major public event.She did not arrive by the traditional great west door but via the poetaposs yard entrance, a shorter route to her seat.Both developments are understood to be tailored for the Queenaposs comfort. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.The Royal British Legion has been a leline to the nationaposs armed forces, veterans and the wider military family. The legion is also famous for its poppy appeal, which encourages public donations infor the red flower worn in memory of the UKaposs war dead. Retired Lieutenant General James Bashall, the RBLaposs national president, said the centenary was a very proud moment for all those associated with the legion and it was an honour to have their patron the Queen and Anne as guests at the service. He said: In our centenary year, we remain committed to our mission to ensure that those who have given so much for their country get the fair treatment, support and recognition they deserve. And, as we look ahead to the next century, we invite the next generation to continue our vital work in the years to come. General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, was among the congregation for the service and the outgoing head of the armed forces was joined by members of the military, veterans and their families from the UK and the Commonwealth. RBL supporters, volunteers and partner organisations were also sat in the pews for the service led by the Dean of Westminster Dr David Hoyle. Readings were given by Colour Sergeant Johnson Beharry, Sir Nick and Sara Jones, whose husband Lieutenant Colonel Herbert H Jones was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his bravery at the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands Conflict. Princess Anne gave a scripture reading on the theme of service, and there was a rededication from the RBLaposs national president, reaffirming the legionaposs commitment to its work. Naomi Hall, an RAF and Afghanistan veteran supported by the RBL as she recovered from physical and mental health injuries, also gave a reading. Ms Hall said: It is a great honour to be asked to help mark the centenary of an organisation that has done so much for me and my military comrades for the last  years, and a privilege to do so in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen. When I was at my lowest ebb, the RBL was there for me and has been ever since. My road to recovery has been a long journey and I could never have imagined it would lead to this day. The RBL was founded on May , , and brought together four national ex-servicemen organisations established to care for military personnel and their families after the First World War. The physical injuries of the ing servicemen were not the only issues that needed addressing. Some men found it dficult to find work, which left their dependants in need. During the following decades the charity has helped members of the armed forces from every major conflict. The past few weeks have been busy for the Queen after she carried out several engagements in Scotland, including attending the opening of the Scottish Parliament on Saturday.It came after her annual summer holiday to Balmoral came to a close and she spoke publicly for the first time about late husband Prince Philip, describing the many happy memories they shared in Scotland.She then travelled back to England and last week started the Queenaposs Baton Relay for the  Commonwealth Games at Buckingham Palace.

She wore a series of gowns by Dolce  Gabbana with her main dress, which had an intricate floral lace design, a high neck, long sleeves and puffed shoulders, reportedly taking six months to create. The couple exchanged their vows in front of celebrity guests that included singer Pixie Lott, and Idris Elbaaposs we Sabrina at the Villa Aldobrandini in Rome. Kitty grew up in South Africa with her mother Victoria, read psychology at the University of Cape Town and has modelled for brands including Dolce  Gabbana and Bvlgari.She also scored invites to the wedding of her cousins William and Harry and her Instagram account shows her at fashion shows in cities such as London and Milan.Although the monarchy has now changed to put sons and daughters on an equal footing in terms of ascending to the throne, British primogeniture law has not been changed to peers such as dukes and earls.

The royals are constantly seeing their names splashed on the front of newspapers and magazines - and for most of them, their names are so recognisable that they often just go by one name.But it turns out that for some royals including Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge, the names they are best-known by arenapost necessarily the same ones that are on their birth certicates.There are some that have very dferent first names on official documents. Here we look at them below... Meghan Markle  When she shot to fame playing Rachel Zane in legal drama Suits, she was known to people around the world as Meghan Markle.And when she married Prince Harry in , she gained a new moniker, the Duchess of Sussex.But even though we all continue to call her Meghan, thataposs not her real first name.When she was born, she was officially called Rachel Meghan but has used her middle name, which her parents have called her since birth.But ironically Rachel was the name of her popular character in Suits.

His full name is Henry Charles Albert David, which is believed to have been picked by his late mum Princess Diana. However, since he was born he has nearly always been known as Harry - apart from in official documents. Kate Middleton  Since she was first on the scene as the girlfriend of Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge has always been known as Kate. Even now,  years on from her wedding, most people still know her as Kate - despite her real first name being Catherine. When she was born in , she was officially called Catherine Elizabeth Middleton. It is believed Catherine was shortened to Kate by her friends at school and university. But nowadays, whenever William refers to his we in public, he always calls her Catherine. King George VI King George VI was the Queenaposs father and his reign lasted from December  to his death in February .But when he was born in , he was actually given the first name of Albert, with George one of his middle names alongside Frederick and Arthur. However, most of his family and friends referred to him as Bertie. As the second son of George V, he was never expected to take the throne but in  his brother Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry orcee Wallis Simpson and he became King. But rather than being King Albert, he chose to reign as George - the same name as his father - to reportedly restore confidence in the monarchy. Queen VictoriaOne of Britainaposs most famous queens was Queen Victoria, whose reign lasted almost  years from  to her death in . But Victoria wasnapost actually her real first name - her full name was Alexandrina Victoria with Alexandrina a tribute to her godfather Tsar Alexander I of Russia. However, she was known to most people as her middle name Victoria or by the nickname aposDrina. And when she ascended the throne, she picked Victoria as her regnal name.

Image: GettyByNeil ShawBethan ShufflebothamNiche Writer:,  Oct | commentsA little-known dog walking law could mean that even owners of the best-behaved dogs could wind up being hit with a huge fine. It’s not uncommon to see dogs trotting alongside their owner off the lead, especially when they’ve been well trained.But in doing so, even responsible dog owners could find themselves in big trouble with the law, including a potential prison sentence and an enormous fine up to £,, Hull Live reports. Car leasing company,Select Car Leasing , has warned dog owners of these laws, so they can avoid falling foul of the law.What are the rules  Under the Road Traffic Act  it is a criminal offence for a dog to be on a ‘designated road’ without being held on a lead. It comes under the same legislation that will see you finedyour dog isn’t secured in the car, and requires you to give your details to an owner should their pet be involved in a road accident.  Local authorities also have the power to issue a Dog Control Order, which comes with a maximum fine of £, – which can be issued as a fixed penalty notice in place of a prosecution. Other things you could be fined for under this order include failing to remove dog faeces, not putting and keeping your dog on a lead when asked to do so, permitting a dog to enter land they’re not allowed on, and taking more than a specied number of dogs onto a land. Not only that, but The Highway Code, Rule , also says: “Do not let a dog out on the road on its own. Keep it on a short lead when walking on the pavement, road or path shared with cyclists, horse riders and pedestrians. This includes bridleways.”It’s Dog Show week over at TeamDogs - a six-day celebration of what makes our pets special in the style of a virtual village fete without the muddy field and dodgy hotdogs. Every day we will reveal a dferent category that we’d love you to enter by simply sharing a photo or video of your gorgeous dog. Find out how to enter. Select Car Leasing’s managing director Graham Conway said: “If you’ve got your dog well trained, good for you. It’s a brilliant thing to achieve and you should be proud that you’re being a responsible pet owner. “However, do not fall into the trap of simply being too smug or over-confident. “You may have seen well-behaved dogs walking at the side of busy roads without a lead, or even crossing busy roads while walking at the side of their owners. To the bystander, it might appear asthe situation is all in control. The onlooker might even be suitably impressed. “But in the eyes of the law, that’s an offence, landing you with a criminal record and a hefty fine.” The rules are in place to keep dogs, owners and drivers safe, Graham explained.  He added: “And you can understand the reasoning behind the legislation. If your dog suffers a momentary lapse in concentration or obedience, and ends up darting into the road, there’s a risk it could cause serious injury to other road users - as well as to itself. “If the very worst happened because of your out-of-control dog, you could face six months in prison and a £, fine.” Are there exceptions  Whilst the rules outlined above are clear, there are, however, a few exceptions – including for dogs that are used for tending sheep or cattle in the course of a trade or business or for trained pooches engaged in work for the police or armed forces. But these only apply when the dog is on duty - not just on their evening walk with their handler, as in which case, the same rules apply.Fetch. Chase. Eat. Sleep.

What other laws surround dog walking  There are other important things to remember for dog owners - particularlyyou’re one of the many millions of Brits new to dog ownership having acquired a new furry family member during the pandemic.TheSelect Car Leasingmotoring expert reveals: “The Road Traffic Act , Section , also species that all dogs - whether near a road or not - should be kept under control by the owner or whoever is in charge at the time.“That means thatyou pass the lead of your dog to your young child - however well intentioned that act might be - and the dog then bolts while your child loses grip on the leash, you can face prosecution. “The Act clearly states that reasonable care must be taken to ensure the dog does not cause injury or damage by straying onto a road. And letting your dog off the lead near a highway just because you think it’s infallible is not ‘reasonable care’.”  According to the Pet Food Manufacturers’ Association, a whopping . million UK households acquired a pet at the start of the pandemic – with almost half of those being dogs. Meanwhile Select Car Leasing, also recently warned about the dangers posed by vehicle airbagsyou let your pooch ‘ride shotgun’ with you in the front passenger seat. A Select Car Leasing spokesperson said: “Most dog owners will know they need to keep their pet suitably restrained when they’re in a car, as stipulated by the Highway Code. “But many owners are left confused as to whether dogs are allowed in the front seat or not. It’s something of a grey area. “Whilst not particularly recommended - dogs should generally be in the backseat or boot for their own safety – there are plenty of owners who do let their dogs ride shotgun, particularlythey own a sports car that only has two seats in the first place.

An airbag is designed to provide protection for a human, not a canine, and the cushioning is simply in the wrong place. “When an airbag deploys it does so with so much force it could even crush a dog cage. “We’ve also heard of cases where a dog has actually been catapulted towards the driver as a result of the airbag going off, resulting in serious injuries for both the dog and the motorist. “We’d urge all dog owners, particularly those with a lockdown pooch and new to dog ownership, to make themselves aware of the dangers.” Some cars allow for the disabling of the front passenger airbag - but you need to consult your vehicle manufacturer guidebook before taking such action.

Over  assaults were reported last year, with inspectors writing: Only serious incidents of violence were investigated. The report added: Most prisoners spent  hours each day locked in their cells with little useful activity to fill their time, while much of the unit was branded shabby and in a poor state of repair.  It added: Prisoners were not provided with coats an we saw some using bin bags to protect them from the rain. After violent incidents, some prisoners were locked up for several weeks without meaningful human contact, welfare checks or any indication as to when the restrictions would end.Some, it found, were locked up all day - bar  minutes to take a shower and make a phone call.  None of the cells had access to electricity, other than a light switch and cell call bell. The regime on the unit was minimal, with half an hour on the exercise yard, time for a telephone call and shower, and a visit by the duty governor and nurse every day, stated the report, which found it needed urgent refurbishment. Inspectors found few meaningful incentives to encourage good behaviour among young inmates. For many, custody at this time was neither purposeful nor rehabilitative, added the report. There was no indoor association provided, which limited the availability of social activities.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

We also encourage them to develop a more consultative and ambitious approach with prisoners that expects more of them and incentivises their engagement with what the prison is able to offer. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson addressed the report. They said: “Whilst we are pleased to see a reduction in violence at HMP YOI Deerbolt, assaults against our hardworking staff are never tolerated and will be reported to the police where appropriate.” Comment MORE ON Ministry of JusticePrisonsFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sinead Bowlesapos devastated parents Andy and Anita Bowles say she had shown no signs of feeling depressed or having mental health issues.The -year-old, who was a team leader at Alton Towers, had been furloughed during the pandemic and just “put her head down” to get on with her university studies, StokeonTrentLive reports. Then, days before her death, she had gone out with friends and contracted Covid. Her father, Andy, said: “I think her feelings came on quickly. She just felt she’d got Covid and was locked up.  “Like a lot of parents who are in this position, the common denominator is you never expect your child to take that course of action.” Sinead had just completed the second year of her degree course at Staffordshire University and wanted to study for a master’s at Cambridge. She was found dead at her family home in Hanley, Staffordshire, on July . An inquest on Monday heard that Sinead’s best friend Keisha Nichols, who lived next door, had raised the alarm after realising she hadn’t let her dog out. Earlier that day, Sinead had also sent a worrying text, saying: “I genuinely wish I could go to sleep and not wake up.” By the time she was found with several ‘goodbye’ notes on her bed, it was too late for paramedics to save her. Sinead had found an interest in helping to turn round the lives of former prisoners, and was doing a podcast with Keisha, in which they would talk about positive ways to improve mental health. Sineadaposs mum Anita, said: “She also had a passion for Men Unite and helping others.” After losing her grandparents aged , she had “started to focus on le again” in the months leading up to her death, Anita said. “As part of her university course, she went to visit prisons around the UK, which she loved. She was a natural in talking to people.” Her parents, who are orced, said she had been a “shining light in our lives and was loved dearly by her family and many friends”. Concluding the death was the result of suicide, North Staffordshire senior coroner Andrew Barkley said Covid may have been a factor in what happened, although it was unclear. The family have raised more than £, for the charity Young Minds in her memory. Andy scaled Mount Snowdon on Friday and is planning to take on the Three Peaks Challenge next year.To donate to the family’s Just Giving fundraising page, clickhere.

Symptoms have been described as being similar to Covid, so how can you tell one from the other Hundreds of thousands of people have been wiped out by a cold that is reportedly worse than Covid at times Image: Getty Images Tetra images RFByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporter:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsMany Brits have been struck down by what has been branded as the worst cold ever - but what are the symptoms and how do you know itaposs not Covid  There isnapost exact data on the number of people who have caught the devastating bug in the past few weeks, as most people donapost report to their GP with a cold.But there is sufficient anecdotal evidence proving the lurgy has spread widely up and down the country.Rather than the usual runny nose and cough, the disease appears to be laying people out. Some people told the Mirror how the cold had been more debilitating than Covid, while others reported having to call sick for weeks because of it. One reported being so badly hit by the bug they had to call sick on the first day of their new job.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments below The spread of whataposs been branded the UKaposs worst lurgy has been attributed to a dip in immunity after a year and a half of social distancing and wearing face masks.Symptoms are very similar to the signs of Covid in a person who has been double-jabbed, raising fears the virus could be dismissed as a cold. So where does this super cold come from and how can you tell itaposs not Covid  Key dferences between cold and Covid symptomsAccording to Professor Azeem Majeed, we are seeing an increase in colds and other respiratory infections across the UK compared to the previous winter, when rates were very low because of social distancing and other infection control measures to tackle Covid.He said the symptoms of a cold typically include a blocked or runny nose, sore throat, headache, cough and sneezing, many of which can also occur in people with Covid-.Now that most adults in the UK have been fully vaccinated, when people do contract Covid-, it is often with milder symptoms that can overlap those from a cold, he told the Mirror. This means that for many people with these kinds of symptoms, a Covid- test will be needed to separate the two conditions. There will be a lot of scope for the public to confuse the symptoms of colds and Covid- during the winter. The message for the public should be to always be cautiousthey have symptoms of a cold, get a test when appropriate, and limit interactions with people outside your household until you are better. NHS guidance says you should treat a cold with:rest and sleep keep warm drink plenty of waterto avoid dehydration gargle salt water to soothe a sore throat You should see a GP :your symptoms do not improve after  weeks your symptoms get suddenly worse your temperature is very high or you feel hot and shivery youaposre concerned about your childaposs symptoms youaposre feeling short of breath or develop chest pain you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes, or a heart, lung or kidney condition you have a weakened immune system – for example, because youaposre having chemotherapy You can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands regularly with warm water and soap, not sharing towels or other household items with someone who has a cold, staying fit and healthy, and avoiding touching your face. The NHS lists the following symptoms as the three big signs of Covid - a high temperature which leaves your back or chest feeling hot, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid study app, the guidance is not up-to-date. The UK still has more cases than most of Europe and I believe this is for two main reasons the first is a lack of masks and social distancing and the second is because we’re ignorant of the symptoms, he told The Mirror. We should be looking out for things like sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. The classic three - cough, fever and anosmia are rarer these days, yet the government has done nothing. By not updating advice, we’re letting people into care homes, schools, workplaces and large gatherings displaying known signs of Covid. Roughly,  in  people in the UK have Covid. If we don’t wake up to the fact these cold-like symptoms could be Covid, we will continue to keep numbers high, putting unnecessary strain on an exhausted NHS. Where does the UKaposs worst cold come from  The spike in viral infections come as the public s to normality -with less stress now on mask wearing and social distancing as Brits head back to work or school.New arrivals at universities also face a spike in Fresheraposs Flu - an increase in viral symptoms as students bring viruses from their own towns to their lecture halls, Wales Online reports.Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth told the BBC she caught a cold at a festival and it was aposthe worst everapos. She said: I barely slept, Iaposd wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired. The cold lasted more than a week, she said. Noor Hashmi, , another student, told the BBC: Normally Iaposm still able to go about my day, but this one left me with muscle fatigue, a lost voice and headache that meant Iaposve just stayed indoors. Dr Philippa advises people experiencing symptoms of Covid - like a new cough, fever, loss of sense of taste or smell - to take a PCR test.Cold symptoms can be treated with rest, fluids and over-the-counter painkillers, she adds. Following Covid prevention measures - like wearing masks and social distancing - means weaposve missed the chance to develop immunity to coughs, cold and flu viruses for two years. As your body has not had the opportunity to fight the illnesses, when they reach you the symptoms can be worse. Should you get a PCR test  The NHS advises people to testthey have any of the Covid symptoms it lists. Experts from Zoe Covid App recommend getting a Covid testyou have common symptoms of Covid, with this being particularly importantyou experience a loss of smell or taste. This is echoed by Cardf Universityaposs Professor Ron Eccles, who told the Mirror you cannot separate colds from Covid in jabbed people. Soyou have a cold and are worried about spreading COVID to vulnerable members of your family or those at work then you should get a COVID test, he said Comment MORE ON NHSAppsCare homesImmune systemNursing homesFluCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jared and Kristi Owens were flying from Texas to Las Vegas at the beginning of the month, but were told by staff at the Southwest Airlines counter at Lubbock airport that the bag on the scale was about two kilograms overweight. Not thinking too much of it, Jared said: Really quickly we are like aposoh, we have got to rearrange some stuffapos. But when they unzipped the bag to see what they could remove, the familyaposs tiny chihuahua named Icky popped her head out of one of Jaredaposs shoes, with the couple having had no idea she was in there when they packed it. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Incredibly, Southwest Airlines staff member Cathy Cook, who was helping the couple at the check in desk when the discovery was made, even offered to look after Icky while they were gone to ensure she remained safe. Jared was blown away by the gesture, saying: They have got a heck of an employee in Cathy. She went above and beyond and never made us feel, you know, they could have turned us in saying we were trying to smuggle a dog to Vegas or something. Never acted like that, they were extremely gracious. Like I said, she was willing to watch our dog for us while we were gone. Jared said the overweight bag check almost certainly saved Ickyaposs le and the pair were thankful they never boarded the plane with the stowaway in tow. But he said that hiding away in small places was not out of character for their lucky pet, adding: She’s the burrower, that’s what she does. She burrows in clothes, she burrows in obviously suitcases now.

It is unclear which vacationers he was referring to and when the argument was. Gabby was reported missing in September after Laundrie, , ed from a cross-country road trip from New York to Oregon without her. Speaking to The Sun, Dog the Bounty Hunter added: I know that he calmed her down usually by grabbing her mouth like this because when you grab someone’s mouth like that you know she was verbal.Gabby was last seen leaving a hotel with Laundrie in Utah, Salt Sea Lake, in late August. After a widespread search for her, the social media influenceraposs remains were found in a remote area in Wyoming, US, on September . Authorities confirmed they belonged to Gabby just two days later.  Laundrie disappeared from his home in North Port on September  after telling his parents he was going for a hike. There was one argument on August  in Moab, Utah, where onlookers called police after Laundrie allegedly hit Gabby.

Some personal issues.  Laundrie, , adds: It’s a long day. We were camping yesterday and camping got… the stuff, wise and stuff. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I hit the bump there.

Officer Daniel Robbins then asks the couple about what they do for work and Gabby says she is a travel blogger. Gabby then claims Laundrie blocked her from getting into the van. She said: He told me I needed to calm down, yeah. But I’m relatively calm. I’m down all the time. He really stresses me out. And this is a rough morning. Gabby later in the same conversation alleged Laundrie grabbed her face, left a “burning” gash on her cheek, and red marks on her arm as cops notice some bruises. She said: Well, he like grabbed me, like, with his nail, and I guess thataposs why it hurts. I definitely have a cut. Like, I can feel it.  In another part of the video, Laundrie alleged that Gabby hit him first and tells the officers: I’m fine. And I love Gabby. I hope she doesn’t have too many complaints about me. I was just trying to make her calm down. Asked by RobbinsGabby takes any medications, Brian replied: She just gets crazy. No. No, I don’t think so. None that I know of. It ended with officers demanding the couple spend the night apart and cops finding a hotel from Laundrie to stay.  Several days later, Laundrie ed to Florida on September  alone while Gabby was left alone in a hotel in Utah. Gabby was last seen on August  when she apologized to restaurant staff after Laundrie argued with them. Her family reported her missing on September .

And one golden retrieveraposs grumpy reaction to a small portion has gone viral after she was put on a diet on the vetaposs orders.The beautul dog, called Mango, has had sympathy from many quarters after she fumed at the lack of food, the Daily Star reports.Her puppy dog eyes have been melting hearts, with TikTok viewers feeling really sorry for her. The clip, which was originally posted by TikTok user @itsmissmango, was a huge hit on the app, with over , views and almost , likes.The video begins as Mangoaposs owner pours a measly cup of food into a big dog bowl.  The golden retriever pauses, clearly expecting more is on the way. It takes a second for her to realise what is going on, but then Mango quickly catches on and begins to flash her owner a desperate look. The adorable look only gets cuter by the second, leaving many to question how Mango’s owner could possibly resist her eyes. But it then turns to turns to a scowl as the dog fumes at the lack of dinner.  But as the video explains, the diet is on the order of Mango’s vet, rather than the choice of her owner, so the poor pup is all out of luck. Viewers instantly fell in love with the golden retriever, with one user commenting: “Omg those eyes are breaking my heart, my love.” Another equally enamoured viewer wrote: “Just give that dog more please.” A third added: “Mango - I’m coming to rescue you!”  Golden retrievers have proven to be one of the most popular breeds on the video sharing app, racking up  billion views. The lovable gundogs are well known for being intelligent and affectionate family dogs, described as ‘kind, friendly and confident’ by The Kennel Club. In another viral video a goldie called Phi Phi was caught ‘spying’ on her next door neighbour, a Samoyed called Bentley.The nosy pup found a peep hole in their garden fence, and loved watching what her ‘bestie’ was doing on the other side. One follower even joked the spy dog could be the next James Bond, writing: “I can’t wait to see more of James Bond the dog, haha #spydog.”It’s Dog Show week over at TeamDogs - a six-day celebration of what makes our pets special in the style of a virtual village fete without the muddy field and dodgy hotdogs.

Sharing her story anonymously, the woman said that she was quizzed on her work, how much money she earned, and her approach to le. She said that the questions continued until she felt like she had been asked about everything, and then they started judging her and discussing between themselves. In the end, the woman said sheaposd had enough of being interviewed for the position of aposgood weyapos, and abruptly left - much to the shock and bemusement of her partneraposs family. What do you think about the womanaposs situation  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, she said: His brother, who is in a similar field of work, started quizzing me on my work. He asked me kinda rudelyI just got into that field to meet a wealthy man. I left early after a conversation with his mom who was asking me about my homemaking skills and not really liking my answer that my boyfriend is the better cook and before I met him I was eating too much takeout but heaposs teaching me to cook. His mom made a comment about how in her day women brought something special to the table. I tried to play it off as a joke saying that I bring him beer, but it really didnapost land. Anyway I headed out early and he stayed that night, but as soon as he left he wanted to talk about why I had dipped super early. I said I felt like I was being interviewed for a job of being aposgood weyapos instead of just meeting people socially, and I feel like thataposs not something I enjoy, I like hanging out with people who are chill and accepting.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. After talking to her partner, who she admits is wealthy, he said that his family were just being protective and she had overreacted - but Reddit users didnapost agree. One said: His family and he are complete a******s. His reaction is a look into your futureyou tolerate that from them and from him. The lot of them clearly feel superior to not only you but anyone who wasnapost born into their tax bracket. Itaposs not wise to ignore such blatant harbingers of relationship inequity and ingrained disrespect. You can do much better. And another wrote: How horrible you had to fend off all their questions and hazing on your own. I hope your partner at least had your back on some of it. Youaposve now clearly stated you are uncomfortable with this kind of behaviour, so your partner should be telling his family that this hazing is no longer acceptable. The question is, now that you know he is retrospectively OK with their behaviour, is he good enough for you  Asked a third.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

I was so embarrassed. My own mum didnapost even show, she wrote in the caption, before adding: Had a baby shower today just to wait there looking stupid, and end up having nobody show.

Another added: Just remember your baby loves you more than anyone  ever could. Honour that baby by doing better for your baby than your mum did for you. Thataposs what Iaposm doing for my daughter. Unfortunately not everyone was quite so supportive, with several TikTokers suggesting Annieaposs story didnapost quite add up.

His comments during a speech at the Defence Development Exhibition came as he stood surrounded by intercontinental ballistic missilesand giant portraits of himself in military unorm, Reuters reports. The DPRK leader said: ”We are not discussing war with anyone, but rather to prevent war itself and to literally increase war deterrence for the protection of national sovereignty.” He added that the US is “creating regional tension with wrong decisions and action” and that he did not trust Washington’s claim that it has no hostile intent towards him, NK news reports.  US military activities such as joint exercises with South Korea are “bringing about many prospective dangers” and “raising the urgency to further strengthen ourselves”, he continued. He also promised to carry out military development plans including new solid-fuelled ICBMs, a new nuclear missile capable submarine and a military reconnaissance satellite – but claimed these were all in the name of self-defence. Describing South Korea’s attitude as “dualistic, illogical and gangster-like”, he went on to reject warn that he would “respond with strong action and not condone” the South’s intent to “harm” North Korea’s right to self-defence. His comments came amid increasingly heated tensions between North and South Korea, less than a month after both sides test-fired ballistic missiles in the latest volley of the arms race. South Korea recently tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, alongside plans to build major new weapons include aircraft carriers and the purchase of American-made F- stealth fighters. North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations claimed it has the right to self defence and to test weapons given the “hostile policy’ by the US, after South Koreaaposs military said North Korea had fired an unidentied projectile towards the sea off its east coast. In an address to the annual United Nations General Assembly, Kim Song said: “Nobody can deny the righteous right to self-defense for the DPRK to develop, test, manufacture, and possess the weapon systems, equivalent to the ones which are possessed or being developed by them.”  The US has said it would be willing to hold diplomatic talks at any time with North Korea. On Tuesday, South Koreaaposs national security advisor, Suh Hoon, is expected to meet with his American counterpart Jake Sullivan to discuss the subject of North Korea. Speaking to reporters in Washington on Monday, Mr Suh said he planned to discuss President Moon Jae-inaposs proposal for a formal declaration ending the - Korean War and for possible easing of sanctions on North Korea, Yonhap news agency reported.

The gruesome graveyard contains bones from humans as well as at least  dferent kinds of animals, including cattle, horses and rodents.The research team that found the bones has suggested they were carried to the Umm Jirsan cave by hyenas over the past , years.The cave is a winding system of lava tubes and volcanic activity has created the hollowed cylinder of rock left behind. The volcanic fields of Harrat Khaybar are just under one mile long - making it the longest lava tube in the area.  Scientists have been studying the underground system for more than a decade before they analysed the bones found there.Study author Dr Mathew Stewart from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Germany wrote on Twitter : This lava tube is chock-a-block with hundreds of thousands of beautully preserved animal remains.Dr Stewart and his colleagues analysed the location and frequency of cuts and scratches on the bones in order to find out how the bones got there.  The team concluded the bones were brought in by striped hyena, a species native to the Middle East. Theyaposre said to be avid collectors of bones, which they bring to their dens to be eaten, fed to young, or stored for later use. Striped hyena skeletal remains and their fossilised poo were also found in the caves, further strengthening their theory. In , researchers working the cave reported hearing growling sounds, suggesting it was still an active site. Dr Stewart said cave bones are unusually well-preserved, offering insight into thousands of years of bioersity. He tweeted: The material at Umm Jirsan has accumulated over the last , years, attesting to the excellent conditions for the preservation of bone within the lava tube. In a region where bone preservation is very very poor, sites like Umm Jirsan offer an exciting new resource. The research was published in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.

proof# Aberdeen#s connectivity has reached a signicant milestone.CityFibre has now laid  milesof fibre internet cables across the Granite City # enough to connect it to its twinned city of Stavanger in Norway, as the crow flies.Both cities on either side of the North Sea share similarities including their reliance on the energy and fishing industries.But as a result of CityFibre’s Gigabit City Investment Programme # Aberdeen will now also join its Nordic neighbours in terms of quality internet.Currently, just % of the UK population are able to access full fibre enabled connectivity, but the service is already live across many parts of Aberdeen.Allan McEwan, CityFibre’s city manager for Aberdeen, says the achievement is the first step in making Aberdeen #one of the world#s best digitally connected cities#.Residents in Woodside, Garthdee, Ruthrieston, Mannofield, Kincorth, Broomhill, Kaimhill, Ferryhill, Northfield, Rosehill, Hazlehead, Airyhall, Mannofield, Hilton, and Torry are already able to access the service.Work is ongoing in Bridge of Don, Rosemount, Cornhill, Kittybrewster, Sheddocksley and Spital areas # with more to follow shortly.Mr McEwan said: “Aberdeen and Stavanger have a well-established relationship, with the two city’s expertise and workforces collaborating and sharing knowledge across the North Sea.#The fact that we have now laid enough fibre in Aberdeen to cover the distance between them really hits home how much progress we have made. We’re well on our way to making the city world-class in terms of its digital infrastructure, and the people of Aberdeen will reap the benefits for decades to come.“As a team, we’re really proud of the speed of deployment and benefits this will bring to Aberdeen, and with our network now live across many parts of the city we are pleased to be enabling residents to connect to the fastest and most reliable broadband services available.#Ties with the North Sea industry has seen Aberdeen establish itself as a global energy hub, and a key player in the energy transition.#We are confident that our full fibre network will provide the city with a critical boost on this journey and secure Aberdeen’s legacy as one of the world’s best digitally connected cities.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/Union-St-Trams-1a.jpg_12358819-e1634033255893-940x564.jpg ","title":"innovative more like back to the future public doubtful of aberdeen tram revival","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA potentialof trams to the streets of Aberdeen has left residents debating everything from Edinburgh#s light rail fiasco and the state of Union Street, to time travel and classic episodes of The Simpsons.Yesterday, The Press And Journal revealed that trams or a light rail system remain in the thoughts of those mapping out the city#s Covid recovery with a grand £ million refresh of the Aberdeen masterplan.However, masterplan lead Councillor Marie Boulton said the prospect would not come to fruition any time soon.It comes as work continues on a tram-like Aberdeen rapid transit system, similar to Belfast#s Glider service, which could be funded by the Scottish Government.The sight of old images of trams in the city brought on a bout of nostalgia for some, who shared memories of the city fleet#s final ride down to the beach.Meanwhile, others hit out at the decision-makers of the day for discarding Aberdeen#s trams in the first place.Few voiced support for the proposals without caveat, admitting the idea still felt far-fetched in the modern age.Stan Castles said: #It is a pleasure to get on San Francisco#s trams, however, to lay the rails again would be a monumental task and cost for the council. Never going to happen.#Others thought the time had come and gone for Aberdeen#s tramways, #as nice as they are#.But the idea captured the imagination of Colin Farquhar, who tweeted that he would #love# to see a tram network in Aberdeen.#Imagine Beach gt Union St gt Holburn Street to Duthie Park. Maybe Union Street gt Bridge of Don or Union Street up to Queen#s Cross.#Jordan Jack, an infrastructure campaigner told us: #The answer is clearly yes, .#Third largest city in Scotland, plenty of dual carriageways ripe to convert to tramways, we should already have trams. Instead we#re getting #bus rapid transport#.#However, while there were healthy numbers of commenters on the Aberdeen Journals social media channels both for and against the idea, it was the noes who came out in force.Many focussed on the potential for an Edinburgh-sized financial disaster, after the project to reinstate the capital#s tram network cost more than £ million than initially quoted.The line eventually put in place was shortened as the project rolled on for three years past the original  deadline.Reader Lorraine Chisholm wrote: #After the disaster and never-ending cost increases and moving deadlines in Edinburgh, maybe trams should stay in the past!#Another, Bob Steele, urged city leaders simply to #look at Edinburgh and learn#.Meanwhile, Jonny Bee pointed to the huge costs associated with a project like reintroducing trams to Aberdeen after their s demise # while leading us nicely on to the next argument against the far-off plans.He wrote: #The project to reintroduce trams to Edinburgh cost almost £m.#Edinburgh is obviously a bigger and more expensive city but those figures still say something about how expensive these things are.#The council would be much better off investing much less money to make existing busses greener.#Others also mentioned Aberdeen#s pioneering work on hydrogen buses # hoped to be tied to a future north-east industry in hydrogen production # after the city launched the world#s first fleet of H-powered double deckers at the beginning of the year.Bill Stewart took to Facebook to tell us it was a #daft idea#, adding: #Juston with the introduction of hydrogen-powered buses.#Removes pollution from the streets while giving the flexibility of route alterations when needed and no need to dig up roads to install tracks etc.#Commenters also revealed they would prefer another project supported by Mrs Boulton: to reinstate rail links between the Granite City and Aberdeenshire towns including Banchory, Ellon, Peterhead and Fraserburgh.Michael Matthew wrote: #At what cost  Think about how much it cost Edinburgh. It would be better having trains from Aberdeen to Peterhead, Ellon, Fraserburgh, Banff etc joining up to Elgin.#While Mrs Boulton confirmed council officers were not actively working on plans for trams to come back, she revealed light rail mass transportation services were at least in the back of their minds.But first, the council is working on fixes for the city centre # to bring people back to Union Street after Covid, to face up to the change in retail practices and as the need for office space continues to lag well behind vacant buildings.Readers clearly prioritised this work first, with some calling for money instead to be put towards reduction of business rents and rates in the city centre to bring business back.Despite Union Street#s former tram lines, readers also raised concerns about sharing the space with the trollies should cars still be allowed to use the city#s main thoroughfare.Some took issue with claims that bringing trams back from the would be #innovative#, as Mrs Boulton claimed on the front of The PJ yesterday.Referencing the family favourite movie, starring Michael J Fox, reader Fiona Cuthbert quipped: #Innovative  More like Back To The Future.#According to many, including Mark Davidson, it would be a step backwards in time # by # years#.He added: #You can do better than this you can#t, it#s time to step aside and let someone who can take over.#mdash Alastair GossipOctober , Once the pop culture references began, it was only a matter of time before the age-old staple of any rail transportation news comments section emerged # the Springfield monorail.An ill-fated con sold to the hometown of The Simpsons, the flawed single-track train lasted a single, acclaimed episode of the long-running cartoon.Springfield residents voted to blow their fortunes on the genuine, bona fide, electried, six-car monorail system # said to glide as softly as a cloud by silver-tongued salesman Lyle Lanley # and sealed the deal through a show-stopping musical number.Bri Mc wrote: #Just need a catchy song to get the locals on board.#Mark Walker added: #Aye surebut let#s get the monorail in first.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/27c5d6d6-1d1f-4039-aa4b-42c92d8cad47-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/27c5d6d6-1d1f-4039-aa4b-42c92d8cad47-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/27c5d6d6-1d1f-4039-aa4b-42c92d8cad47-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/27c5d6d6-1d1f-4039-aa4b-42c92d8cad47-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"take away takeover of empty supermarket in inverurie town centre","story":"Inverurie fast food fans will soon have another menu to browse after plans to convert an abandoned town centre supermarket were approved.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

who had just announced Stephen Hatfield as their new manager - forced three corners in the opening stages as they aimed to make an instant impression for their new boss.But Gala weathered the initial storm and with just four minutes on the clock Calum Hall cut in from the left and drilled a -yard pile-driver into the bottom corner of the net.After that, the visitors totally dictated the play, pinning Gretna back deep into their own half with skipper Jack Beaumont spraying passes across the park as Gala probed and pressed for the breakthrough.And it came on the ninth minute mark when Ciaren Chalmers burst through the home defence and his shot squeezed over the line.The dominance continued and a third goal arrived in the rd minute when Zander Murray spectacularly erted a Beaumont delivery into the roof of the net with a volley.After the interval Gretna retreated into their own half to try and keep the score down and the plan worked.Although Gala should have scored a fourth on the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty for handball.Daryl Healys spot kick lacked power and the Gretna keeper pulled off a fine save.Gala continued to dominate but Gretna were dangerous on the break and almost pulled one back when a shot struck the inside of the post but bounced back along the line.And Gala had keeper Dean Beveridge to thank for a brilliant slide tackle to foil a Gretna forward who had evaded the offside trap.However, the visitors were coasting to victory with Gregor Jordan and Lewis Hall outstanding at the back with the game outcome out of sight.Unfortunately, a stramash in the Gala goalmouth in injury time as a corner was about to be delivered ended the game on an ugly note.The result was four yellow cards - two for each team - with one of them to Gala right back Sean Docherty, currently on loan from Hearts, but as he had been booked earlier he ultimately received a red card which was a disappointing end to the game.With five wins in a row, Gala now have a huge Lowland League encounter against Civil Service Strollers at Netherdale on SaturdayThe Edinburgh side are the surprise packets of the Lowland League this season and are currently deservedly fourth in the table with another midweek win against Caledonian Braves.

However, I do know that there were a lot of concerns locally about its effect on existing accommodation providers. Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate. The new proposals will still represent a signicant investment in Tweedbank and the Scottish Borders and will bring jobs to the local area.

This week, reporter Hilary Scott speaks to two men who, for several years, have helped people in the Borders...Itrsquos hard to believe that the Peeblesshire Foodbank has been running for almost a decade.When Francis Mordaunt and James Adams decided to join the small team of volunteers, they all thought the foodbank would be short-lived, a stop-gap while the economy recovered from the financial collapse.But the desperate crisis of people going hungry continued to rise, and the impact of the pandemic was felt most deeply by poorer households.Former manager Francis, and team leader James, have now retired from their roles.This week, they told me how the foodbank went from operating from a garage with a few referrals, to becoming a registered charity with premises in Cavalry Park, feeding hundreds of people across the county.The foodbank was formed in  following a meeting held at St.Peters Episcopal Church, initiated by the Rector Rev Jim Benton-Evans.Rev Jim was chairman, Katie Buckingham was secretary, and the manager was Gillian Hughes. The board of governors included several clergy, a headteacher, a local councillor and several others, who decided to operated under the auspices of The Trussell Trust, who were involved in many other foodbanks in the UK.Francis retired to Peebles that year and joined the congregation of St Peterrsquos.ldquoHaving told Rev Jim that I was interested in becoming involved in the community, he invited me to become a volunteer, he said.ldquoMany years earlier, while living in Edinburgh, I had helped at the Old St.Pauls Ritz Cafeacute that provided breakfasts during the week to the homeless men and women in the Grassmarket and central Edinburgh. So volunteering at the foodbank in Peebles appealed to me as it was another opportunity to help those who for whatever reason were going hungry.Initially, Francisrsquos voluntary role was packing food parcels at the Bakehouse Hall and delivering them.ldquoIn those early days, the food was stored in Enid Clariersquos garage in March Street Lane, he said.In Autumn , local MP David Mundell officially opened the Peeblesshire Foodbank, and Francis was appointed treasurer.Francis said: ldquoI inherited a positive bank balance from the initial fundraising efforts before I became a volunteer. Unfortunately, our costs were almost non-existent, so there was little to do the first purchase I remember was a set of scales as the Trussell Trust required us to weigh all food donations in and out and record them on a central database.The foodbank soon moved to more permanent premises in Cavalry Park with storage space for food donations.Francis added: ldquoWe now had a modest rent to pay, insurance costs and a mobile phone but few other costs. The Trussell Trust required us to become a charity, and Rev Jim asked me to complete the application to the Scottish Charity Commission.The Peeblesshire Foodbank became a registered charity in January , and two years later, Rev Jim handed over the reins of the foodbank.Before departing, he set up a management structure to ensure the foodbank continued to run smoothly.Francis, who was appointed as manager, worked with team leader James Adams.Rev Callum MacDougall was the chairman until his retirement in , when Father Tony Lappin took up the position.ldquoOnce the pandemic hit the premises at Cavalry Park became hopelessly small, and Father Tony arranged for the foodbank to move temporarily to St Josephrsquos Hall, explained Francis.ldquoSo one of my last actions for the foodbank before retiring was to arrange the rental of the new much bigger premises in Cavalry Park where the Peeblesshire foodbank is now located.Since its inception, the number of people reaching out to the foodbank for help has grown rapidly.ldquoIn the early years, we had up to two referrals a week, about  a year with an average of two people fed per referral. That meant we were feeding about  people a year, said Francis. ldquoBy , that had increased to nearly  people a year, and by  it was over .Francis said the role made him quite emotional at times: ldquoIn several cases, the recipients burst into tears on receiving their food parcels delivered to their doors. It meant a lot to me to see the gratitude as the foodbank was meeting an urgent need.Jamesrsquos involvement in the foodbank echoed Francisrsquos, as he retired to Peebles from Belfast in  and joined St Peterrsquos Church.He said: ldquoMy we and I were anxious to get involved with the community and make friends, and to help with a foodbank seemed a worthwhile opportunity.Recalling the old days when they used a garage to store food, James said: ldquoIt had no heat or light and littleany shelving, but it was a base. Donations were mainly from Tesco collections.ldquoThere was a book recording parcels issued, and my memory was that perhaps only four or five were issued in an average week, and there was a description of the call and the circumstances. I donrsquot think the availability of the Foodbank was well publicised at that time.However, he says there was a dficult period when he and Francis struggled to keep up with demand.ldquoWe ended up covering  days at a time, which was not sustainable. We were, on average, delivering around eight parcels per week at that time.Appeals for help brought in big-hearted community volunteers.James said: ldquoWe were able to move to a four-week rota, and Billtook responsibility for uplting donations and collecting empty boxes. In addition, positive steps were taken to advertise the foodbank and increase usage, and leaders met at intervals to discuss all aspects of the foodbank. This was, I believe when things began to move forward.Although the charity had an army of volunteers, financial constraints were a concern.ldquoIn the beginning, money was scarce, and there was always a worrywe could continue to afford the premises when we moved to Caly Park, said James.However, both have paid tribute to ldquosuper fundraiser, Nancy Fenton.James added: ldquoNancy held a coffee morning and progressed from that to raising money by selling a wide iety of items online. The work she put in was phenomenal, as was the cash raised, but these efforts raised the profile of the foodbank as well. Her efforts gave us a very secure financial base which has provided some security as the Foodbank progresses.In addition, local churches, businesses, charities and iniduals raised funds for the foodbank, usually on their own initiative.And iniduals have been making financial donations directly to the bank account via the website.Francis added: ldquoDonations of food, particularly through the local supermarket collection points, always continued at a high level, and shortages were only ever confined to a relatively few inidual items. The generosity of the Peeblesshire community has been incredible.Reflecting on his days delivering food parcels to those in need, James said: ldquoThere were people, mainly those living alone, who I delivered to more than a few times. I rightly or wrongly felt that they found it dficult simply to cope with le in general, and the foodbank was essential to simply feed themselves.Ultimately, COVID and age marked the end of Francis and Jamesrsquos incredible journey with the Peeblesshire Foodbank.The Trussell Trust stood down everyone over the age of  years.During the pandemic, one thing thatrsquos brightened our lives has been the stories of the everyday heroes doing their bit to support people through these dficult days.Together, these two selfless gentlemen worked tirelessly for several years making sure struggling families had a meal to put on the table.They are the retiring heroes behind Peeblesshire Foodbank, who helped countless people."},{"url":null,"title":"former-jed-forest-star-completes-ninth-charity-marathon","story":"FORMER Jed-Forest star Chris Laidlaw is now three quarters of the way through his lsquo in  marathon challengersquo.Laidlaw, who hails from Jedburgh has been running a marathon each month this year to raise funds for three charities which mean a lot to him - the Murrayfield Injured Players Foundation Marie Curie and Alzheimerrsquos Scotland.His first marathon took place on New Yearrsquos Day on a -mile course near Edinburgh and since then he has run another eight.This was ato happy territory for him as he set out from Fisherrow Harbour in Musselburgh and finished at Hallhill, home ground for Dunbar Rugby Club, where he spent three years as Development Officer.He said: ldquoThe marathons donrsquot get any easier.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

When they called me for a pre-programme chat, I was asked how my age affected my parenting. I was askedI had less energy as an older parent and got very tired. My response was that every parent, no matter the age, gets very tired!I agreed to do the show. Their intentions were good and I was treated very fairly, and I think the host was sympathetic and supportive. Irsquom not the oldest parent in the land, but I do concede that Irsquom older than most, at least in terms of my younger children, the youngest of whom is six.But the experience raised some interesting questions for me about how age is often used to define us and our abilities, and indeed how we can define ourselves by it.Thankfully, these days society is far more erse and also, I believe, less judgmental, of people who donrsquot conform to stereotyped roles. But the truth is, recently I have begun to feel the cold wind of ageism affecting how I see myself and my opportunities.This radio programme was just the most recent example of my age being regarded an issue. Of course, as we age we do change in our abilities, nobody could deny that. But that can be for the better as well. Being seen as older is relative to the context, I get that. As a dad of young children, I accept the label of older parent. But it was the assumptions about how my age must negatively affect my capabilities as a dad which hit me hard.I felt uncomfortable even acknowledging these feelings to myself. Then I realised that was part of the problem: that people who are older can feel they have no entitlement to speak out against the unfair judgements they feel are attached to their age. Societyrsquos message can be brutal: as people get older, they need to give way and quietly fade .Irsquom nearly , not very old really, but certainly getting on. This is not about denying my age. I would not want to pretend to be younger. I am who I am. Actually, Irsquom quite proud to have made it this far and hope to have a couple more productive decades, at least,my luck holds out.But I fear that so far Irsquove only had a taster of what is to come with assumptions about my age. It seems to begin in earnest when someone reaches their s.Finding work after the impact of the lockdowns is a massive challenge, and huge source of anxiety, for millions of people. Those who are older, I suspect, will find their age a source of subtle discrimination, regardless of their actual abilities and family responsibilities.And the key word here is lsquosubtlersquo. Few employers will say out loud that they think someone is too old for a job, eventhey have the abilities to do it well. There is anti-discriminatory legislation in place now to prevent that. So itrsquos unspoken and structural ndash the discrimination is so ingrained that most of us donrsquot see it or realise discrimination is taking place. Its most powerful effect is the internalisation of it by older people themselves, who donrsquot even apply for jobs they know they are fully qualied and able to do, because of the fear they will be seen as ldquotoo old.I myself have only come to understand this as I have grown older and experienced it personally. I was once young, of course, as all older people were, and I was as guilty as anyone  of judging older people because of their age when I had youth on my side. So I speak from no moral high ground and some may say itrsquos just the way of things.Thatrsquos the pernicious nature of this kind of discrimination: it can be seen as a sad but inevitable rite of passage part of the circle of le in which we will inevitably be marginalised by society in a host of dferent ways as we get older.But I donrsquot believe it need be this way, and part of changing it is talking honestly about it, and calling it out when it happens. Age is just one part of who we are. It doesnrsquot completely define us or our abilities, capabilities or suitability for a job or le responsibility. And let us not forget that age discrimination doesnrsquot only affect older folk. Young people, including teenagers, can suffer from it too from older people.There are cultures which revere the contribution and abilities of older people, rather than dismiss or diminish them letrsquos try and make our society one of them. I donrsquot say this for me, but for everyone out there who is experiencing that gradual push into the margins they feel they just have to accept, regardless of what they can actually do.Itrsquos about inter-generational respect and it has to go both ways to be effective. In a sense, we would all be winners with this change, as we all learn,we are lucky enough to become older, that time truly does fly."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraiser-raises-700-walk-scott-foundation","story":"Iain Donaldson-Elder, , a former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil, participated in this yearrsquos recent Walk with Scott.Walkers covered  miles across East Lothian and Iain joined at Haddington as they made their way to the town rugby club after following the Longniddry to Haddington railway walk.Accompanied by Jim Liddle, from Leuchie House, a respite centre near North Berwick for people with MS and other long-term conditions, Iain ldquorolled his wheelchair for about three miles and was delighted to receive a certicate as a Scotter of the Year from Councillor Colin McGinn.Iain told the Courier: ldquoThe walk itself was wonderful, emotional and, although short, very rewarding as I got to meet people that I had only known through Facebook.

This one, on September , wasnrsquot great. The PCR test, organised weeks before with a well-known health and beauty chain, and essential to cross the border into Croatia fewer than  hours later, had been cancelled. I could, however, travel to a Glasgow branch ndash from Dundee.After thanking them for their offercame the panic to source another test in Dundee, where there isnrsquot a huge amount of choice. The only provider had a single slot left in half an hour, and the cost would be pound. Considerably more than I had planned for.However, itrsquos no test, no fly, despite having recovered from Covid and two shots of Astra Zeneca.Once the negative test result arrived the next day, it was time to complete the Croatian government entry paperwork. On top of that there was the matter of sourcing and paying for a PCR test for the second day of my. In addition, having planned to visit three or four locations thinking in Croatia, I would need to research the options for a test before flying back  days later.Finally, where would I find the paperwork to get back into the country when I had my negative testin Croatia. The alternativehellip I honestly didnrsquot plan for that.*If the trip hadnrsquot been work-related, to check out a new Croatian hotspot, then I wouldnrsquot have chosen to venture abroad this year. However, with only four days on the commission I would be looking for a test centre pretty much as soon as I arrived. It made sense to extend the stay and make all the palaver worth it.A flight of just under three hours with a mask wasnrsquot particularly onerous. In fact, Irsquove had colds after so many previous flights that itrsquos something I might do in the future.Arrival in Zadar was remarkably stress free. Having steeled myself to be shepherded into the post-Brexit duncesrsquo queue, where people pointed and laughed, and to have my neatly prepared paperwork examined in close detail, it was smoother than most arrivals. One queue for ldquoall passports and there was no need to extract paperwork from my smart folder. It seemed that the submitted test result had been linked to my passport. A quick flash of the bottom half of my face and I was across the border.With the first kiss of toasty evening air on my unmasked skin, it was worth it.Downtown Zadar had enough of a buzz without feeling crowded. Those who have already experienced Dubrovnik or Split will recognise the atmosphere, but itrsquos quieter here. No Game of Thrones group tours. However, there are the same marble-tiled streets and mix of architecture ndash from the ninth-century Church of St Donatus to UNESCO recognised city walls, to what locals call the Tito houses, apartments built quickly out of necessity after the Second World War.So much of the city, some estimates say %, was destroyed by the Allies by a year of bombing, it was known as the Dresden of the Adriatic. Moving the rubble uncovered a Roman forum, built from the st to rd century BC. There is nothing precious about this find, however, with the ruins used as makesht seating.From here yoursquoll hear distant sounds of the haunting Sea Organ, created by Croatian architect Nikola Bascaroni#. Sit on the steps at the end of the peninsula, look out at the islands and hear the waves create harmonic sounds in the pipes within the steps.Bascaroni# also went on the create the adjacent Greeting to the Sun. Hundreds of solar plates soak up the sun by day and by night create a multi-coloured light show.The islands had piqued the interest. Checking that weekrsquos sailings there was a ferry to Silba island the next day. Accommodation booked, and with after a fast sailing of an hour and  minutes hourI stepped on to a car-free island. Bliss for the nervous pedestrian.No cars, no masks, apart from in the islandrsquos small grocery store. Eating was alfresco and there was little  so do apart from wander the quiet lanes, take a dip in the Adriatic, and sample the local speciality, Dalmatian tuna. Vegetarians will struggle. Vegans should picnic from the storehellipThree hours back across the Adriatic and Rijeka, Croatiarsquos third-largest city and an approach that looks very much like Dundee from across the Tay.Apart from an attractive Old Town and the city where I would almost kill myself by climbing the  steps of the Petar Kru#i# stairway in  degree heat, this is the place where I had to source the lateral flow test  hours before arriving home. It took a couple of hours out of a Saturday morning, but it was easy ndash and cheap, at around pound. After filling in a short form at the Public Health Institute, I was directed to the car park where several testers in clean suits worked their way through the queue.Once swabbed, I was told that the result would take longer than the  minutes required by the EU Covid Digital Certicate. I could have walked away and waited for an email but I wanted the old school piece of paper in my hand ndash and the result. It did cross my mind that things could change pretty quicklythe test was positive. Around  minutes later the translated certicate arrived I was fit to fly.Now the UK paperwork could be completed and once that was edI could check in for theflight and I could enjoy the last couple of days in Rijeka and one of Europersquos most stunning capitals, Zagreb, where I would fly home.Everywhere in Croatia, it was clear that they were more than relieved to see visitors back in their cities, towns and on the islands. The country does have exports, but increasingly the economy is dependent on tourism.Of course, between pressing send and publication, the rules will have changed. The Scottish Government site is the place to check and then the government website of your planned destination.It was an absolute faff at times, but what Irsquoll remember is the sound of the Sea Organ, the quiet lanes of Silba, the top of that staircase in Rijeka, and my continuing love affair with Zagreb.*If I had been ing after October  and not fully vaccinated, I would have still have had to had a PCR test and complete a passenger locator form in the  hours before ing.

His claim that Ms Blackman published a ldquonon-apology apology is incorrect she did not give the impression of an apology, because she does not have anything to apologise for. She has made it clear she stands by her position.He has done what he has accused others of: he has put a target on Ms Blackman because she took a stand against transphobia, while he rails against \"the loss of womenrsquos sex-based rights\". As a woman I would add that trans peoplersquos rights are of no threat to mine. It might helpMr McKenna realised that we have been living with trans and non-binary communities for a very long time, and wersquove lost none of our rights, nor will we lose any future rights. If people such as Ms Cherry could stop for a moment, and think about the damage they perpetuate daily towards others, this world would be a kinder and more peaceful place. A basic level of respect for all human beings should not be up for debate. We should always love and accept people as they are.It is an embarrassment to see Scottish MPs pour gasoline on to the fire of transphobia and call it \"standing up for womenrsquos sex-based rights\".If we are incapable of extending the courtesy of humanity to people persecuted by a manufactured and cult-like obsession with genitalia, we have no chance at all of being a forward-thinking, free and independent country.We need more SNP MPs to take a stand against transphobia, not fewer. Our society as a whole should always be one that chooses love over hate, peace over combat, and compassion over suffering and cruelty.Ciara Doyle, South Ayrshire.WHY ARE WOMEN BEING SILENCED IrsquoD like to raise a cheer for both Joanna Blythmanrsquos article crime test for new students is only the start\", The Herald, October  and also Catriona Stewartrsquos ldquoIn Lammy Land you can grow a cervix but not a brain . At last some journalists are speaking the truth about the trans issue and the Scottish Governmentrsquos gender identication legislation. What is the SNP Government thinking with this legislation  Why are women being silenced over this  When the voters and in particular women realise what this will really mean for them there will be a mini explosion.As an ordinary womanplease protect our female-only spaces. I do not want biologically male people allowed free access to them. A lot of us think knowledge of facts and common sense have gone out of the window.Elizabeth Reid, Dunblane.WE ARE NOT GUILT-TRIPPINGJOANNA Blythmanrsquos criticism of the pre-matriculation modules at the University of St Andrews is inaccurate and misleading in several important respects.The modules at St Andrews are not new. They have been in place here for several years, were campaigned for by our students, and co-designed with them.In the current feverish rush to vent at anything that might appear vaguely woke, Ms Blythman and others have fixated on a single question which asks students to consideracknowledging any feelings of personal guilt for unconscious bias is a good or a bad thing.The answer to the question is, explicitly, that ldquono one should feel guilty for displaying unconscious bias, butguilt is felt, acknowledging it can be a useful starting point for tackling bias. That is a very dferent thing from Ms Blythmans assertion that St Andrews is ldquoguilt-tripping its students in the name of ersity.The voices raised in anger against these modules are almost exclusively middle-aged and white, their university years are decades behind them, and minor considerations like the truth appear not be getting in the way of a good rant about the ldquolatest craziness.Thankfully, students take a more mature and nuanced view. Only the unwise would think it a good idea to put , people from  countries into one square mile in north-east Fe and trust to luck that there would be a unorm understanding of community norms.Our students recognised this. That is why they campaigned for these modules on consent, ersity, and sustainability, and sought to make them discursive and challenging.On ldquoposh St Andrews, and Scottish students making up ldquojust % of the student body, we respectfully offer two facts for consideration: approximately % of our Scottish entrants each year have a background in care, come from a low-progression school, or live in an area of multiple deprivation.The number of Scottish students at St Andrews, or any Scottish university for that matter, is determined entirely by the Scottish Government, not the universities themselves. We are told precisely how many Scots we may admit each year, andwe exceed that number, we are fined. That is the price of a system which must be capped to enable free tuition. Scotlandrsquos universities are as representative of the population as the Government allows them to be.Niall Scott, Director of Communications, University of St Andrews.INDOCTRINATED TO THINK SCOTTISHI NOTE that David Bone and Bob MacDougallappear to agree on the signicance of the First Minister hinting that the SNP only had to wait passively for Scottish independence as the No voters will have died.The assumption that young people coming to voting age will vote Yes for independence in any future independence referendum seems at first sight to be typical SNP complacency. Many will accept without question the fickle and impetuous inexperience of youth as perhaps being behind this assumption.However, it should be remembered that the SNP is in charge of Scottish education. The saying attributed to St Ignatius Loyola, ldquogive me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man, seems to me something for unionists to keep in the back of their minds as indeed the rational older generation dies off.For example, the CfE document on Experiences and Outcomes People, Past Events and Societies for Social Studies, tells us that young people learn to develop an ldquo understanding of the history, heritage and culture of Scotland.I am certain that many people will agree that the import of the word \"heritage\" is in itself something which could be taken as not only emotive but in the new sensitivity of an SNP Government playing a waiting game, potentially inflammatory.Although there is rare reference to the UK in the guidance documentation I am left feeling that our young people are at risk of being indoctrinated at an early age in school to think predominantly Scottish rather than British. Perhaps the First Minister has well thought out her subterfuge to simply wait.Bill Brown, Milngavie.WESTMINSTER AT THE WHEELDOUGLAS Bone complains of \"the almost dystopian Scotland the SNP has created\" since it came to power and Bob MacDougall talks of \"the shambles made of our public services\" in Scotland. Both conveniently forget that Scotland has two governments, one based in Edinburgh, and one in Westminster. The Scottish Government has few levers of control while Westminster is responsible for the steering wheel, accelerator and brake.Oddly, both place the blame for our current predicament on the Scottish Government a bit like suggesting that the passenger who selects the radio programme is at fault when the driver crashes into the wall.John Jamieson, Ayr.INDY QUESTION IS SIMPLEIS Robert Frazerkidding, or does he really believe that ldquo tens of thousands of ordinary people\" are so disinterested in understanding what they would be voting for, or so lacking in intelligence to care, that they would be confused by having to answer such a simple question in an Indyref as ldquoShould Scotland remain in the UK  Yes or No\"  I doubt such people would even bother to vote at all, but perhaps they could be encouraged to lodge a protest votethere was to be a third option of ldquoDonrsquot care\" or ldquoToo dficult\".Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.Letters: Leave voters owe the rest of us an apology"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-less-2-000-new-cases-recorded-overnight","story":"According to the latest Scottish Government figures, , new cases of Covid- have been recorded in the past  hours. deaths have been reported of someone who tested positive for the virus over the past  days.The total death toll according to the measure used by the Scottish Government therefore remains at ,.:Two thirds of additional winter deaths caused by Covid-Separate figures produced by National Records of Scotlandwhich record the number of deaths where Covid was mentioned on a death certicate, put the figure at , as of October .NRS figures include deaths where ldquosuspected or ldquoprobable Covid- appears on the death certicate.Of the , new tests for Covid- carried out which reported results in the past  hours ndash .% were positive.A total of  people are currently being treated in intensive care with recently confirmed Covid-, with  in hospital who had recently contracted the virus overall.The total number of first vaccinations given is ,, while ,, people have now received a second dose."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmIf you#re keen to catch the northern lights, this winter, you could be in luck during the next  hours.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633967490726.jpg--covid_19___mon_11th_october_figures.jpg?1633967490000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211011newscovid 19 mon 11th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows Five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Credit: Simon Graham Harrison PhotographyRead MoreSave Havelock House group wants it listed for th anniversary Developer of old UTV Havelock House HQ fights refusal by plannersThe plans attracted dozens of objections, many due to the cultural and historical importance of the site, and the size of the proposed building – eight storeys. Belfast City Council planners recommended the application for approval, but it was rejected by members of City Hall#s Planning Committee.Locka Ltd appealed the decision however this was recently dismissed by the Planning Appeals Commissioners.The council raised several concerns over the application, firstly relating to the height, scale and design of the proposed building.They argued it would have an overly-dominant impact on the Grade B listed Klondyke Building to the east, and the Grade B+ listed Rose Cottage in Walnut Court to the north west.The planning commissioner said: In my opinion the height and massing of the proposal would be inappropriate, seen in juxtaposition with the Klondyke building the detailed design does not respect the setting of the listed building in terms of scale, height, or massing and this conflicts with [council planning policy]. I judge that the council’s first reason for refusal is sustained.Another council concern was that the proposed building would not fit with its surrounding context and would have an overly-dominant impact when viewed from Ormeau Road and the residential streets to the west and north west, unacceptably harming the character and appearance of the area”.The planning commissioner ruled that the proposed development fails to respect the surrounding context and said this conflicts with sections of the council#s planning policy.I judge that the council’s second reason for refusal is sustained. I acknowledge that the design of the proposed building was deemed acceptable by the council’s planning officers during [pre-application discussion] however, the council itself decided to refuse the planning application for the reasons stated in the decision notice it is this refusal that I have considered, the commissioner#s ruling said.Campaign group Donegall Pass Community Forum welcomed the decision to dismiss the appeal.This outcome may be seen as the beginning of positive change for the community. The community is very appreciative of the result. They view this as an opportunity for the developer to engage with the communitythey are willing, the group said in a statement.Only through engagement can a design solution for the site, which benefits the majority of interests for all parties, be achieved. Donegall Pass Community Forum would welcome such a conciliatory move from the developer as a step to improve relations with the community.This encouraging decision focuses the need to change current legislation to embed communities’ views within the planning process. Belfast City Council is not legally required to undertake community engagement.This is seen as a discretionary decision by its Planning Department. Existing planning law offers only a tokenistic nod to the community’s views, particularly in large-scale developments which affect whole neighbourhoods. Current legislation is outdated allowing developers to force through poorly thought out design solutions.This reinforces ision and exclusion within communities exacerbating their further decline.”Olympian Homes has been contacted for comment.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City Council PremiumAlmost half of Belfast businesses don’t believe prospects will improve in coming months – survey PremiumPest control costs in NI have risen by % in the last five years PremiumMarathon organisers face criticism after single-use plastic bottles left on east Belfast streetTeenage boy held at knepoint during south Belfast robberyNI council axes £k spend on diaries and Christmas cardsMost ReadBelfast restaurant Top Blade slammed for posting image of woman’s underwear on social mediaNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingGlenanne Gang#s Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threatening letter to Denis Mullen#s daughterInjured man admitted to hospital in ‘serious’ condition after being found in field as police investigate possible link to car fire jobs to go as Co Down firm goes into liquidationTop VideosPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Belfast BeatAlmost half of Belfast businesses don’t believe prospects will improve in coming months – surveySinn Fein JJ Magee’s fish supper dinner makes appearance during Belfast council universal credit debateKicking down road ‘laughable,’ says Sinn Fein as bonfire motion fails: PUP councillor blasts attempt to ‘undermine unionist culture’City Quays Gardens: Vibrant urban project to take root along Belfast’s waterfrontFirm linked to ex-KFC tycoon Michael Herbert given the green light to transform Belfast church hall into apartmentsLatestNorth Korean soldier in blue generates social media buzzKiller’s first victim ‘may have been dead for at least a day before being found’AI could detect rogue police officers, says expertIreland now entering ‘new phase’ in pandemic recoverySally Rooney defends decision to block Hebrew translation of new book,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: PAOlivia FletcherOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe number of black primary and post-primary school students in Northern Ireland eligible for free school mealshas increased by more than % since , according to official figures.However, the number of white students on FSM has decreased by % in the same period.The figures from the Department of Education are based on the Northern Ireland school census and show that .% of black students were eligible for FSM in the - academic year, while % of white students were eligible in the same school year.A shocking .% of Irish Traveller students were eligible for FSM too — down from an even higher .% in the - academic year, meaning that four in five Traveller pupils were entitled to the aid at the time.Free school meals are offered to the children of parents or carers who receive benefits such as income support, Jobseeker’s allowance or Universal Credit.The meals are paid for by the Department of Education and administered by the Education Authority. The Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla Yiasouma, said she was “disappointed” but “not shocked that black and minority ethnic children are disproportionately represented in the child poverty statistics”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNorthern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla Yiasouma FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorthern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla YiasoumaDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up And there is currently no specic policy in place to address that some minority ethnic children may be more likely to experience poverty than those from white backgrounds.The Commissioner, who advises Stormont and holds it to account on issues that affect children and young people here, told the Belfastthat “we’re not doing anywhere near enough work to lt our children out of poverty”.Ms Yiasouma said: “If we know that particular groups of children are more likely to be living in poverty — for example, such as those who are from a Travelling or minority community — then we need targeted interventions to make sure that isn’t the case.”In the - academic year, .% of black primary and post-primary school pupils were entitled to FSM, according to the statistics.And in the following year, almost % were eligible to claim.Since , Indian students have consistently been the least likely to be eligible for FSM and in the - academic year, .% of primary and post-primary students from this ethnic group were entitled to the aid.In the same year, .% of Chinese pupils and % of Pakistani pupils were eligible for FSM.In October , the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland noted in a report that children from ethnic minority backgrounds were more vulnerable to poverty, “but specic actions to address this were not apparent”.The Department for Communities is now working on an anti-poverty strategy.A spokesperson said: “The Executive’s anti-poverty strategy is being developed using a co-design approach, in line with the principles of citizen and community engagement referenced in New Decade, New Approach. The strategy will aim to address the causes of poverty and minimise its impact on iniduals within all sections of society.”A number of organisations, including the Equality Commission and the Commissioner for Children and Young People, are part of the advisory process.The Commissioner said: “We look forward to seeing how that is actually going to lt families with children out of poverty.”Poverty leads to “educational disadvantage,” Ms Yiasouma said, adding that “that is what leads to mental health issues”. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Department of EducationMinister urged to support young people who missed out on education due to Covid with new ‘catch-up’ policyPrincipal blames rising costs and supply issues as plan for £m new build derailed grammar schools in NI sign up for single transfer testDemand for integrated education in NI ‘not being met’, says charity as Stormont department criticisedStormont committee told progress made over report on underachievement in education systemMost ReadBelfast restaurant Top Blade slammed for posting image of woman’s underwear on social mediaNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingGlenanne Gang#s Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threatening letter to Denis Mullen#s daughterInjured man admitted to hospital in ‘serious’ condition after being found in field as police investigate possible link to car fire jobs to go as Co Down firm goes into liquidationTop VideosPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Northern Ireland‘My feet are killing me!’ – Speedo Mick giving away thousands on charity tourAbortion clinic exclusion zones needed to stop ‘harassment campaign’, MLAs toldThe Northern Ireland Protocol – what is it and why is it so controversial Five Northern Ireland restaurants longlisted for prestigious Asian Curry AwardsNathan Doak: ‘Sky’s the limit’ for budding Ulster star… but he won’t be the next Ruan Pienaar, says coachLatestNorth Korean soldier in blue generates social media buzzKiller’s first victim ‘may have been dead for at least a day before being found’AI could detect rogue police officers, says expertIreland now entering ‘new phase’ in pandemic recoverySally Rooney defends decision to block Hebrew translation of new book,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

Brae Clinic in Derry is working from a waiting list which commenced on July and there arecurrently  patients waiting to be seen. The waiting lists consists of  face-to-face consultations and  telephone consultations. googletag.cmd.push SineadMcLaughlin, SDLP, said: Waiting lists and waiting times for access to contraceptionservices in Derry and the wider Western Health area have become excessively long. “I am extremely concerned to learn that there are nearly  patients waiting to be seenand that this represents a nine-week queue for access.” She continued: While I am very sympathetic to the situation facing the Western Trust as a result of the pandemic and staff vacancies, lack of access to contraception services may lead to serious social and medical dficulties for many patients. “Family planning is an incredibly important service. It is essential that the Western Trust acts urgently to bring waiting lists and waiting times down as quickly as possible. Health Minister, Robin Swann addressed Stormont regarding the current waiting times for contraception services after McLaughlin addressed the issue. He said the COVID- pandemic had placed “immense pressure on an already reduced service.” Western Health and Social Care Trust have seen immense staff shortages over the last few months. An appeal for staff was released on September  afterAltnagelvinHospital wasunder extreme pressure caring for patients. Commenting on the contraceptive services, WHSC said: “Due to staff sickness and shortages clinics had to be cancelled and clinic capacity reduced based on available staffing levels.”     On June , at Brae Clinic,  patients were waiting for their cancelled appointment to be rescheduled and as of th September these patients have all been seen and the current waiting list wasintroduced. Contraceptionclinics in Omagh and Enniskillen are also experiencing similar problems. On average they are receiving - enquiries per day from patients looking to book anappointment. Vulnerable patients who contact or arereferredto the service are prioritised for treatment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The new greenway will start at St. Columb’s College,through TheHawthorns to Templemore Road and across to Templemore Sports Complex to UpperGalliaghRoad. The development will continue along the line of the former LoughSwillyrailway line, acrossSkeogeLink Road, and on toElaghBusiness Park. googletag.cmd.push Planning officers had providedseven reasons for refusal. One highly discussed reason to refuse was that the new greenway would run through Zoned HA housing lands. Sinn Fein Councillor Christopher Jackson said: “This is a greenway and something we have been promoting right across our city and district as a positive piece of infrastructure to allow people to choose more sustainable modes of transport.If there is zoned housing there, we should be incorporating the greenway through it.” Head of Planning Maura Fox explained: “The proposal is on housing zoned land. By severing the site with one aspect of the development, you are potentially disallowing houses in part of the zoning which has already been protected for housing.” Ken O’Sullivan, Project Manager, speaking on behalf of the Council said: “We know that the housing master plans for these lands is not yet available and we believe our proposals could be easily incorporated into any future housing masterplans on the lands.” After y debate, Councillors voted nine against refusing the planning officer’s recommendation to refuse, with four voting to for refusing the application.     The Councillors approved the application to go ahead, with conditions. The application had been previously deferred in July this year to allow for a site visit. This proposed greenway will be a part of a wide range of new greenway connections between Derry and the South.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

All of it has added up to this. “Anyone that handed my family and friends their change while in the bar and asked for it to be donated, up in Broslashn,you dropped a few quid into their mason jar after a meal,you took part in the Sandwich Co’s breakfast fundraiser oryou bought one of the Iron Man cocktails down at the Taphouse! and of course all of the people that liked, shared and donated on FB, Instagram or Twitter.     “All of you have helped out and all of you played your part in raising this money, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. “A special thank you to Joe Mc Kane and Odhran Mc Kane and the McKane family for being with me every step of the way. Georgie Harkin, Seamus Crossan, Stephen Quigley for being in high spirits. “A special thank you of course to the Bogside and Brandywell Health Forum - they’ve done so much and will continue to do so after my work in raising the money is complete. “And of course a special thank you to my friends family and all of the people that were down supporting.

Dawn McLaughlin was speaking at the Londonderry Chamber’s President’s Annual Dinner in the Everglades Hotel in the city. Attended by over  business leaders, politicians, and civic leaders, the dinner was the first major Chamber event since March . googletag.cmd.push Sponsored by Find Insurance NI, the dinner was hosted by former broadcast journalist Sarah Travers and featured a ‘fireside chat’ with RTEacute Europe Editor and Brexit expert Tony Connelly, who is originally from the city. Dawn McLaughlin said now is the time for elected representatives, candidates, and ministers to prioritise Derry and the North West as we move closer to next year’s election and has called on parties to work constructively to rebuild the local economy after the impact of the pandemic. Chamber President Dawn McLaughlin said: “The pandemic has had a hugely detrimental effect on the North West economy, but I have been heartened and filled with pride by the way in which our local business owners and leaders reacted to the crisis before them. “The dinner is a fantastic occasion and opportunity to celebrate our resilience, recognise the strides we have made collectively over the past  months, and commend the efforts made by our local business community in protecting jobs and keeping their companies afloat in the most dficult of circumstances. “As we begin to come out the other side of the pandemic, the time is now for our ministers and our elected representatives at Stormont to prioritise the North West and deliver for our region.     “While the signing off of the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the opening of the School of Medicine at Magee earlier this year were welcome first steps, there is much more that needs to be done to address regional inequality in Northern Ireland and level up the North West City Region. “Ahead of the next Assembly election in spring next year, candidates from all political parties must commit to properly invest in our city, create and attract new jobs to our region, and address deficiencies in our economy. Opportunity “This includes committing to the full expansion of Magee, transforming our physical infrastructure to improve our connectivity to and from other economic hubs, marketing our region to businesses and investors across the globe as a prime location to do business, and properly supporting our businesses as they recover and rebuild post-pandemic. “There is now an opportunity for all key partners in our region – business leaders, elected representatives, educational institutions, civic leaders – to work together and make sure the North West builds back as strongly as it can after Covid, prioritising jobs, investment and prosperity for our businesses and our communities.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

Dawn McLaughlin was speaking at the Londonderry Chamber’s President’s Annual Dinner in the Everglades Hotel in the city. Attended by over  business leaders, politicians, and civic leaders, the dinner was the first major Chamber event since March . googletag.cmd.push Sponsored by Find Insurance NI, the dinner was hosted by former broadcast journalist Sarah Travers and featured a ‘fireside chat’ with RTEacute Europe Editor and Brexit expert Tony Connelly, who is originally from the city. Dawn McLaughlin said now is the time for elected representatives, candidates, and ministers to prioritise Derry and the North West as we move closer to next year’s election and has called on parties to work constructively to rebuild the local economy after the impact of the pandemic. Chamber President Dawn McLaughlin said: “The pandemic has had a hugely detrimental effect on the North West economy, but I have been heartened and filled with pride by the way in which our local business owners and leaders reacted to the crisis before them. “The dinner is a fantastic occasion and opportunity to celebrate our resilience, recognise the strides we have made collectively over the past  months, and commend the efforts made by our local business community in protecting jobs and keeping their companies afloat in the most dficult of circumstances. “As we begin to come out the other side of the pandemic, the time is now for our ministers and our elected representatives at Stormont to prioritise the North West and deliver for our region.     “While the signing off of the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the opening of the School of Medicine at Magee earlier this year were welcome first steps, there is much more that needs to be done to address regional inequality in Northern Ireland and level up the North West City Region. “Ahead of the next Assembly election in spring next year, candidates from all political parties must commit to properly invest in our city, create and attract new jobs to our region, and address deficiencies in our economy. Opportunity “This includes committing to the full expansion of Magee, transforming our physical infrastructure to improve our connectivity to and from other economic hubs, marketing our region to businesses and investors across the globe as a prime location to do business, and properly supporting our businesses as they recover and rebuild post-pandemic. “There is now an opportunity for all key partners in our region – business leaders, elected representatives, educational institutions, civic leaders – to work together and make sure the North West builds back as strongly as it can after Covid, prioritising jobs, investment and prosperity for our businesses and our communities.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

Drumboe left Whitehead in Co Antrim, where it has been restored, early on Saturday on its way to the Donegal Railway Heritage Museum in Donegal Town where it will go on display. googletag.cmd.push The -tonne engine, which travelled on a low-loader, passed through Derry, Strabane, Stranorlar, Ballybofey and Barnesmore Gap, before arriving in Donegal Town. It stopped at the Tinneys in Strabane, the former site of the railway station to which it made its last journey in December . The engine also stopped on Barnesmore Gap, the scene of many iconic photographs of the engine in its heyday. Following its arrivial in Donegal Town, Drumboe will be lted into position on a new presentation  at the museum. The Drumboe engine was one of half a dozen built for the Donegal railways in  and . It has become the iconic steam engine of the era of railways in Donegal.Two years in the making The project tothe engine into the county cost €, with funding from Leader on top of fundraising. Theof the engine has been more than two years in the making. As well as the restoration of the engine, the project has included the building of a new presentation  and canopy at the museum. The manager of the museum Nial McCaughan explained there is a lot of excitement about theof the engine.     “This is a big thing for the museum but also for the county,” he said. “This is the first Donegal steam engine to be back in the county. It’s also the very engine that sadly left on the very last journey on December,   - the very last passenger service that left Donegal Town for Strabane. So it has come full circle - it is coming back to Donegal Town and it is a great thing for us all.” He said there are plans that the engine, which has been restored “from a rusting hulk,” will be run again on tracks in Donegal. Most of the engine has been fully restored to an operational state so that when funding becomes available, it could go back into steam. “We would love to put Drumboe back in operation - that is that plan,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

An Greacuteasaacuten and Gael Linn – one of the main Irish Language organisations in Ireland – have published an open letter to the Department in North asking them to intervene. The letter was signed by over  teachers, speakers and activists. googletag.cmd.push In it, the letter said the  disapplication of the requirement for all pupils to study an additional language at GCSE, “had detrimental consequences for the study of languages and Irish in particular”. The letter also cited a  per cent reduction of students studying Irish at GCSE level since  and called for the  disapplication to be reversed so that pupils must pick a language as one of their GCSE choices – be it Irish, French, German or Spanish. Sinn Feacutein MLA Delargy said: “I have great admiration and respect for the teachers who have signed this letter and are demanding better from the Department. “The figures presented in the letter make for stark reading, it is clear the emphasis of the curriculum has placed on STEMsubjects over recent years to the detriment of languages. “There have been numerous shortcomings from the Department over the last number of years in relation to the language, these trends must be reversed. “While the Irish medium sector continues to grow unbounded, it’s time to look at the language and other languages within the English Medium Sector.     “Sinn Feacutein supports the demands made in the letter and will engage with the Department as they encourage our pupils to study a language.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The Foyle MLA also confirmed that Sinn Feacutein will bring a motion to the Assembly on Monday calling for action to end this crisis. A drop in the number of HGV drivers, due to European workers now seeking work in EU member states following Britains exit from the EU, has led to supermarkets and petrol stations in Great Britain reporting of shortages. googletag.cmd.push The north of Ireland is in a dferent situation as due to it retaining its Single Market status post-Brexit, goods and petrol have been in supply.

He said: “Boris Johnson and his government’s Brexit has created a crisis in the production of agri-food and the transporting of goods through lorry driver shortages. “Alongside the reckless move to end freedom of movement with its xenophobic undercurrents which has seen many EU citizens leaving, the Tories are refusing to recognise the need to ensure skilled workers from across the EU who want to work here can do so. “The British Government needs to find a solution to the problem of labour shortages which they created through their hard Brexit and ensure EU citizens can work in the north. “Sinn Feacutein’s Assembly motion calls on the Economy Minister to put pressure on the British government to act to end the labour shortage crisis and resolve the issues facing workers and local businesses.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The balance on how to create nutritious, easy-to-prepare school lunches five days a week that kids will love too is a continuous challenge. Healthy Heroes, the lunchtime nutrition programme from the Irish Bread Bakers Association and Bord Bia, offers plenty of simple suggestions. googletag.cmd.push Their latest programme is already underway in hundreds of primary schools around the country aiming to help children improve their eating habits for the better and increase their fitness levels. Studies show that just one in ten Irish childrenmeet the national physical activity guidelines, while at least one in five nationally are still overweight or obese. Created by teachers and behaviour change experts, with the support of Dr Mary McCreery, one of Ireland’s leading consultant nutritionists and dieticians, the schools-based lunchtime programme recognises the importance of intervening early so children develop healthy eating behaviours before they leave primary school. It aims to increase the nutritional value of the lunch box with useful tips and suggestions on ways to include fruit and vegetables in lunch boxes as well as easy – to- understand information on the food pyramid and the contents of the ideal lunch box. The programme involves a novel peer learning approach with sixth class students mentoring younger students on the importance of nutrition and being active. This provides the younger children with important role models, while the older children have an opportunity to foster valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. According to Dr McCreery, school lunchtime is an important opportunity to develop positive attitudes towards food choices and nutrition, leading to le-long eating habits. She offersthe following tips to parents when it comes to school lunches:     Set a good example by eating a iety of foods yourself and make your own lunch at the same time so your child knows how much you enjoy them.Introduce new foods without any special comment so your child can make their own mind upthey like them or not. Make sure you have a wide range of foods available at home. Try to offer dferent foods every day. Shopping in advance is the best way to ensure you have plenty of iety for lunch boxes. Include a carbohydrate, a protein, dairy, fruit, and veg in their lunch boxes. To provide a balanced diet educate your child that treats are for weekends and special occasions. Involve your child in the food shopping to encourage themto pick healthy options for their school lunch. And here are some balanced lunch suggestions from the latest Healthy Heroes programme.

A European Studies student from Waterford, Maireacutead Butler, will use the opportunity to raise awareness with Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin about the challenges still facing girls and women. Speaking about the event, Maireacutead said it isnt good enough that no woman has ever held the office of Taoiseach, but that she was delighted to be part of the takeover. googletag.cmd.push She said, I hope girls across the country will see this and be able to envision themselves in this office one day. The  year old, who is a member of Plan International Irelands Youth Advisory Panel, will also discuss the results of the groups recent research into sexual and reproductive health misinformation in Irish schools. She said, Im grateful to have the opportunity to present the findings to the Taoiseach today.Most concerning were the responses we received about consent, contraception and LGBTI+ identities. “The reality is that when young people are not armed with the right info on sexual and reproductive health, girls and young women are at particular risk of being subjected to sexual and gender-based violence and early pregnancy.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

Conor’s book is open for bookings for weekday and weekend slots throughout the Northwest Like most of us, Conor’s le grinded to a halt during COVID. Not being able to do the things he loved he decided once again to wipe the dust off his old guitar and give this singing thing a go. Luckily for Conor his work from home schedule at times wasn’t overly demanding so he found himself homing in on his guitar skills between meetings. He credits both his music and his love of the outdoors for keeping his sanity throughout the winter lockdown of . A keen swimmer, Conor found himself using the cold water, taking regular dips in Enagh Lough throughout the week to stay present and focused, alleviating the worries and uncertainty that gripped the nation during COVID times.

Fronted by Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite, they confidently wander the border between Indie Rock and Americana — sounding like a long overdue meeting of the minds of Pinegrove, Frightened Rabbit and Julien Baker AND THEY release “Where We All End Up In The End” on October . The album will be released in its entirety on Bandcamp on  October, followed by single releases on DSPs each month thereafter. To give listeners a taste of the album, smallmint will perform a streamed album launch gig on  October and release the fourth and final single ‘Pseudonym’ on DSPs on  October. I don’t know for sure but I’m going to say that DSPs are download streaming s. Hot Press have said The layered production, melodic guitar hooks and enthralling dynamics come together to form a striking and powerful sound and they know a thing or two. The Last Mixed Tape have said A well-crafted piece of songwriting, the bands sound moves dynamically with each twist in the song’s tail”, but I don’t believe they’re the actual last mixed tape and Chorblossom have predictably said Drenched in dreamy Americana vibes, Liv is a superb second single from smallmint, I’d love to see them rip into someone meself. ‘Where we all end up in the end’ began le in , when live tracking commenced at Smalltown America Studios in Derry. Smallmint worked closely together with producer Caolaacuten Austin to achieve the sound on the record. Frontman Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite wears his emotional intricacies on his sleeve through his vocal delivery and upfront lyricism, all set to a musical backdrop of crunchy electric guitars and pounding drums. The result is a confident statement of intent — a testament to the band’s hard work, musicianship, and their own high standards. He said: “We wanted the album to feel natural and to actually sound like a band playing live in a room, which is exactly how it was recorded. It was important for us to keep that space and energy in the recordings - no need for overproduction or too many overdubs, we wanted to let the arrangement of the music by the band, and the lyrics speak for themselves.” Check them out on facebook smallmintband or instagram smallmintband or even www  smallmintbandADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them. The -year-old father of eight, whos Irelands last traditional matchmaker, said hell be using his well-honed techniques to conjure romance on Spanish soil, including bringing his -year-old “love ledger” with him to arrange dates. The third-generation matchmaker said inquiries had already been flooding in from across the world following the release earlier this year of the Hallmark movie As Luck Would Have It, a romantic movie loosely based on the centuries-old matchmaking festival.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs. It provides basic shelter, comfort and security. A home also affords personal dignity, a space for privacy and a foundation for family le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Best wishes to Knockevin staff  ","story":"SLIEVE Croob councillors Cathy Mason and Roiacutesiacuten Howell paid a recent visit to the new Knockevin senior school in Castlewellan.Located on the site of the former Castlewellan Primary School in the town, the councillors welcomed staff and students and hope that they will be very happy and will be warmly welcomed by the wider community.Cllr Howell said the global pandemic had ldquosignicantly disrupted the education of the special school pupils and impacted on their learning, communication and mental health.She extended best wishes to school principal Sarah Liddell and senior department leader Gillian Rea.ldquoWhilst the children have been on the premises from September, there are still issues that I and Cllr Mason will be working closely with the school, the Education Authority and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ensure that staff and pupils have the best all round experience on their newly refurbished site, added Cllr Howell.Cllr Mason said Knockevin caters for pupils with severe and profound learning dficulties aged between  and  and aims to provide a supportive educational environment where they feel secure, at their ease and thrive both educationally, socially and spiritually.She said the main school is located in Downpatrick, with an Early Years Centre in Dundrum.ldquoNow we have the senior school in Castlewellan which will seek to help pupils achieve their maximum level of independence in preparation for le when their education finishes, said Cllr Mason.She added: ldquoHaving visited the Downpatrick site in recent months I have seen first hand how happy and content the children are in school..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_bid.jpg","title":"Bid to save St Mary’s school from closure  ","story":"GOVERNORS and staff have pledged to try and save a primary school in Saintfield from closure.St Maryrsquos Primary School is earmarked to close by August  next year due to low pupil numbers.The Education Authority last week published the closure proposal seeking any objections or support to be lodged by November .The proposal was made by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the schoolrsquos trustees.It states enrolment to the  year-old school on the Old Grand Jury Road has dwindled to  pupils for this academic year, with the majority in the Primary  and  classes.The proposal claims there is currently only one pupil in the schoolrsquos Primary ,  and  classes, two pupils in Primary  and no pupils in Primary .A spokesperson for CCMS said: ldquoCCMS has carried out initial consultation on the closure of St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield, which is a Down and Connor diocesan school. Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges. CCMS believes that the proposal to discontinue provision at St Maryrsquos PS would not impact signicantly on other schools.It lists other Catholic primary schools in the area mdash St Caolanrsquos in Darragh Cross, St Josephrsquos in Crossgar, and St Patrickrsquos in Ballynahinch mdash as being between less than four to seven miles away from St Maryrsquos and which could take its pupils.The proposal also said closure plans had been put back for a year due to the Covid- pandemic.The SDLP councillor for the area, Cllr Terry Andrews, said he shared the concerns of parents and staff.ldquoSt Maryrsquos has provided first-class education to the community for many, many years and the staff are to be commended for their dedication to generations of families who have sent their children there, he said.ldquoI would encourage all local people to take part in the consultation to the EA and make them aware of their strong feelings to the proposal..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Business owners urged to engage over town future  ","story":"THE Downpatrick business community has been urged to play a full part in the consultation exercise on the continued economic regeneration of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is spearheading the initiative and local councillor Dermot Curran appealing to businesses to get involved.While a number of politicians are in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, local authority officials are not keen. However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others. I hope that this vision can be realised..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_conor.jpg","title":"Conor shines in final  ","story":"DROMARA travelled to Ballykinlar to take on a fancied Drumaness side in the county U- Football Shield final last Sunday evening.The game started well for Drumaness with two quick points on the board from Niall Flanagan and Ben Cassidy in the first few minutes, but soon Dromara were awarded a penalty after Thomas McKey was fouled in the box.Thomas took the penalty himself, but it was well saved by lsquokeeper Reece Rogan.Dromara did get on the scoresheet after a foul on Odhraacuten McCann was converted by Jon Rodgers.Both defences dictated play over the next period with Dromararsquos Elliot Harris, Sam Warwick and James Furphy keeping the mobile Drumaness forwards at bay.Dromararsquos fortunes took a hit when forward Odhraacuten McCann suffered a nasty shoulder injury and had to be replaced.Just before the water-break, Drumaness rattled off two excellent long range scores from Conor Armstrong with Dromara replying with an equally great score from Joe McAllister.Dromara were finding the physicality of the Drumaness full back line of Leo Madine, Ben Miskelly and Philip Gladysz dficult to penetrate.Drumaness finished the quarter with a point from Conor Murphy leaving them ahead by three points.The second quarter started off with another cracking point from Conor Armstrong and within minutes Drumaness took control of the game.Shea Quinn got on the end of a long ball and bagged a goal and a minute later Conor Armstrong hit a second goal.Dromara rallied with good points from Thomas McKey and Jon Rodgers but once again Drumaness replied with a point from a free from Conor Murphy and two further points from the unstoppable Conor Armstrong.Drumaness half backs Jaiden Murdock and Conn OrsquoHagan were delivering quality balls to their forwards and Dromararsquos half backs Aidan OrsquoHare and Ryan Gates had to work very hard to stem the relentless attacks.Young Lorcan McNeill scored a great inidual goal to offer Dromara some hope, but, as ever, the Blues hit straight back with scores from Jake Madine and another from Conor Armstrong.The half ended with a fine point for Dromara from the energetic Joe McAllister to leave Drumaness leading by nine points. Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks. Congratulations to the Drumaness team and their mentors on a great display and a deserved victory.Dromara -Drumaness -U- Shield Final.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_cormac.jpg","title":"Cormac enjoy his first days at Harvard University  ","story":"CORMAC Savage was only  when he got his first experience of the hallowed halls of Hard University.Standing in the same place where former president John F Kennedy once walked was enough to confirm to the young teenager that this is where he had to be one day.Just four years later, the Downpatrick man has fulfilled his dream and is studying at the world-renowned Ivy League university in the US.The former head boy of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School has jumped right in and immersed himself into his classes and every extra-curricular activity and group he can possibly join.He has been in the city of Cambridge, on the fringe of Boston, since late August.Despite getting four A* grades in his A-Levels and having achieved considerable praise for his roles in school politics and as a Youth Parliament Member for South Down, he said he was overwhelmed to have been accepted into Hard late last year.ldquoEvery single day I think Irsquom so lucky to be here. I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago. I wrote a letter at  and saidI would like to meet himhe was ever in Ireland.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions. The testing centre in particular is a key asset in the ongoing fight against coronavirus.ldquoThe excellent frontline staff who work there deserve to be allowed to get on with the job free from threats of any kind.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London. She ran an impeccably paced race with splits barely wavering beyond a couple of seconds per mile.This metronomic performance earned her a . finish, well within her . aim and placed th out of the female finishers. Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm. After leading out the EDAC team at the Road Relay Champs in style, he ed to Victoria Park in Belfast for the weekly parkrun.These events are not races but timed runs open to anyone who registers. Neil was taking part as a training exercise in his group coached by Mark Kirk.He lead the pack in with a super slick . for the k which was reported later as being the third quickest parkrun time recorded at any of the weekend parkruns throughout the UK.We donrsquot normally report on parkrun as it is impossible to keep on top of all the activity, but this one is worth a mention. Well done for putting EDAC on the map.We are always open to new senior members and have acquired quite a few recently who are glad that they have taken the plunge.We are an all rounder club with members chasing speed, distance and the challenges but we also have a main body who come to training to keep fit and enjoy the good company.If you are interested, please email Donal at membership@eastdownac for details..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie.jpg","title":"Francie builds boat with recycled material  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man is realising his dream of building a river boat by using recycled materials such as wood pallets and aluminium.Instead of costing around pound, for a new boat of the same size and specication, Francie Morgan aims to finish his ft boat on a budget of pound,.The  year-old intends to launch the four-berth boat from Carrybridge in Upper Lough Erne in Co Fermanagh next May, with the help and support of his family and many friends.But before that, he would love to enter it as a float in next yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.While the main structure is complete, Francie will be working over the winter and spring to fit out the inside.The father-of-seven began to build the boat last year during lockdown and scoured scrape-yards and recycled materials yards to get items which either cost him a fraction of their original price or where the owners were only too happy to get rid of them.ldquoTherersquos men who are only too happy to see me coming to take away some pallets. It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative image of the area.He claimed both councillors asked for a decision to approve expansion work at the plant to be deferred on ldquohearsay evidence and suggested they never checked what he described as the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a petition containing , signatures in support of the controversial development at the Gocean.The plan to develop a -acre site, including a new marina, has split public opinion in the town, but local community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will signicantly raise the profile of Killyleagh as a tourist destination and add support to existing town facilities such as shops, entertainment, recreational facilities, schools and churches.SAINTFIELD mdash Dozens of brides arrived at Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church Hall on Thursday evening for a girlsrsquo night out.There was a distinct absence of grooms as women and girls filled the hall

along the catwalk, wedding tales recalling generations of local brides emerged.The compere told the story of one local woman who had left her husband waiting at the altar for half-an-hour because her

travelling to the far side of the world to adopt her ldquolittle angel, has helped to make a Derryboye womanrsquos le complete.Rosemary Hamilton seems to thrive off her busy lestyle and the fact she and her husband, Terry Graham, adopted a baby girl from China three years ago.Rosemary, who is the co-founder and now chairman of Holywood-based Future Image PR consultancy firm, and her husband were one of the first families from Northern Ireland to adopt a child from China.As Rosemary explained, she has had a long love affair with China and its people, ever since she heard a woman recite the Lordrsquos Prayer in Chinese when she was at Sunday School.Her fondness of the country continued into her adult years, she travelled quite a bit throughout China and Asia, and when she and Terry married they automatically thought of adopting a child from the country..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_mands.jpg","title":"M%26S hotly tipped to open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

This was delayed because of Covid and I canrsquot wait to get started on turning this into an interactive wall mural.The Housing Executiversquos South Down area manager, Liam Gunn, has explained why the Good Neighbours make Great Neighbourhoods campaign is important.ldquoOur estates are full of phenomenal people like Michaela, who make living in their community so special.

A number of children have to cross the road on their way to school and it is essential that it is safe to do so, he continued.ldquoA pelican crossing can help achieve that and I hope that the roads minister will look favourably upon my request. This is a critically important issue that must be addressed.Cllr Curran said it is his understanding that the recent incident involving a child at the Downpatrick Road ldquocould have been quite serious and hopes that action will be taken to prevent any kind of repeat.He said pupils who attend the busy primary range in age from  to  and in addition to his request to Mrs Mallon, he would be keen to meet meet with roads officials on site.ldquoIt is a very serious situation when drivers are not obeying the speed limit, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoA new pelican crossing would require drivers to come to a complete stop to allow children to cross safely..Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe recent incident involving a child has reinforced the need for a dedicated road crossing and I hope that the Department for Infrastructure will respond positively to my request.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13080662.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyPan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expectedAlmost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin SwannDUP Ministers urged to quit roles by unionist rival Jim Allister after High Court rules boycott of North-South meetings unlawfulMan accused of killing cyclist Shaun Mullan, , by careless driving acquittedMost PopularAurora Borealis: Northern Lights could be visible in NI as geomagnetic storm expected to reach EarthDennis Hutchings challenges evidence in trial over  killing that identies him as a soldier in witness statementsDonaldson against ‘having to accept laws of court over which we have no control’Homophobic killer gets extra five months in jail for spitting on female prison officerLord Frost and Simon Coveney in NI Protocol twitter spat                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The resulting health crisis shows the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. The tendency to shirk responsibility, to think short-term and to ignore hard choicesOn Saturday, I fell off my bicycle and smashed my left wrist. As a result, firstly I was sedated and given a procedure to stabilise and reposition the bone. Then, the next morning, my joint was rebuilt during several hours of surgery at Royal Victoria Hospital. I’ve written about the NHS quite a bit over the years. But an up close and personal experience always helps put things in a sharper perspective.That’s primarily because, as a patient, you can’t help but be struck by the kindness, dedication and professionalism of almost every member of staff you meet in hospital.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...They really are remarkable people, with reserves of caring and empathy that most of us can only wonder at. It’s all the more impressive that they display these qualities under such challenging circumstances.For example, the nurses who show endless reserves of patience through the small hours of the night while they are abused and sometimes even threatened by distressed patients. These are often older people, confused and delirious, who are not in any way responsible for their behaviour, but they still say hurtful, potentially intimidating things. It’s a special skill to be able to deal with that, calmly and firmly, in the middle of a busy sht.When you are in hospital receiving care, you see that staff are working incredibly hard, often without breaks, while remaining helpful, interested and sympathetic to every patient. But there are dficulties with the system too. It is busy and struggling to cope.I was unfortunate, or perhaps not, that I had an open wound on my broken joint. There was a risk that it would become infected and that was why I had my operation quickly. The surgeons were blunt that,it hadn’t been for the cut, I would probably have had to wait much longer. Indeed, many patients were waiting considerable s of time, some of them in terrible pain, for essential operations on broken legs, hips and other bones or joints. The lists for emergency surgery are long and growing.There is clearly considerable pressure on beds, with some people waiting in discomfort in A  E or in inappropriate wards or bays. But, at the same time, it can be a y and frustrating process being discharged, even after that decision has been taken and plans have been made to fill the bed. Everybody’s doing their jobs with the utmost professionalism, but there are snags and bottlenecks that hold everything up and give an impression of inefficiency.For an explanation, we have to go back to Stormont and the failure of successive health ministers to reform the NHS in Northern Ireland. Since at least , and the Transforming Your Care report, but arguably as long ago as  when the late Maurice Hayes published his recommendations, experts have repeatedly pointed out what needs to happen.We know that there should be a smaller number of acute hospitals with a greater concentration of expertise and more resources should be directed at providing care in the community. In addition, there are dficulties with staffing, particularly in certain jobs and specialties. Rather than act on these requirements, the executive at Stormont repeatedly delayed taking necessary but potentially unpopular decisions.In , the Donaldson Report made specic recommendations to close facilities and reorganise services. It was parked, due to one of Stormont’s periodic crises, and when the assembly got back to some sort of normality, in , the new minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill, commissioned a new review, Bengoa, which made broadly the same points, but presented them in more general terms. It’s an endless, circular process sustained by politicians who refuse to take responsibility for dficult decisions, like closing smaller hospitals. The latest incumbent at the health ministry, Robin Swann, has had to deal with Covid, so you can understand perhaps why reform has not taken priority, but no great change seems imminent. Remember that, just before coronavirus arrived, in December , there was already a nurses’ strike and medics predicted that the system was close to breakdown.The pattern is clear, and Stormont’s refusal to act has allowed NI’s NHS to become outdated in comparison with services in the rest of the UK. Our politicians have let down its brilliant employees badly and repeatedly. Indeed, the crisis in health offers a neat case-study of many of the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. Their tendency to encourage shirking responsibility, thinking only about the short-term, taking the easiest choices and ignoring more dficult ones, blaming everybody .Unavoidably, the unionist parties’ most pressing problem at the next election is the protocol. However, in terms of making Stormont work, an honest, responsible approach to government that confronts long-term problems, rather than denying or ignoring them, is something that voters will think is long overdue.Royal Victoria HospitalNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyPan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expectedAlmost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin SwannDUP Ministers urged to quit roles by unionist rival Jim Allister after High Court rules boycott of North-South meetings unlawfulMan accused of killing cyclist Shaun Mullan, , by careless driving acquittedMost PopularAurora Borealis: Northern Lights could be visible in NI as geomagnetic storm expected to reach EarthDennis Hutchings challenges evidence in trial over  killing that identies him as a soldier in witness statementsDonaldson against ‘having to accept laws of court over which we have no control’Homophobic killer gets extra five months in jail for spitting on female prison officerLord Frost and Simon Coveney in NI Protocol twitter spat                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Jim Dennison Simon Community Chief Executive, Upper Bann SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly, Lurgan Councillor with Armagh,Banbridge and Craigavon Council Cllr Ciaran Toman and Director of Homelessness Services for Simon Community Kirsten Hewitt.There’s also a floating support service that covers the local area, helping people secure and maintain their tenancy.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
