At a photo call in Switzerland, the Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of York had skied down to have a group photograph. The princess took one look and decided it was all far too tame. “Let’s have a go,” she said to Fergie. The two royal wives proceeded to bang hips and push hard, each trying to dump the other in the snow. This horrified the royal husbands and they had to fight hard to stop them. The cameramen loved it.’JENNI RIVETTPersonal trainer‘I absolutely loved Diana’s sense of humour. She was always playing practical jokes. We had a strict routine at the Harbour Club gym, then suddenly one day she wanted to move to the stretching mat which I thought was odd. When I walked over to her I saw Hugh Grant and Simon Le Bon doing some stretching with her. She just wanted to be on the mat with them and show them how flexible she was. They were all laughing, she was showing them her various exercises and encouraging them to copy her.’JAYNE FINCHERPhotographer         Prince Charles and Diana sharing a laugh on a royal flight to Australia. Photographer Jayne Fincher said she \u0027had a really funny laugh too, it came right from her stomach\u0027‘In the late 1980s, early 1990s before it all fell apart, when we were on long-haul flights she’d come back from first class and hang around the galley for a natter and a joke with whoever was around. She had a great sense of humour and was very good at remembering jokes. She always had a joke up her sleeve and she used to tell quite a few dirty ones. She had a really funny laugh too, it came right from her stomach. Once she saw something funny she was off. That was quite incredible at the time, because royals did not do that.’PATRICK JEPHSONFormer private secretary‘One evening in New York she was coming out of her suite at the Plaza Athenee and the head of her American Secret Service detail was waiting for her. He was very much smitten with the princess, I could tell. That evening she was wearing the most spectacular off-the-shoulder black evening gown. All you could really register was acres of lovely tanned royal skin. She leaned forward and prodded the secret service agent. Under his tuxedo you could see a shape under his shirt. She said, “What’s that?” and the guy said, “Bulletproof vest, Ma’am”. She stepped back in mock horror and said, “Shouldn’t I be wearing that?” That was just typical of her.’DR LILY HUA YUAcupuncturist and herbalist‘She would come twice a week for acupuncture. I have five treatment rooms and Diana always liked to be in room five, which was the biggest treatment room and very light and airy. Sometimes she would invite two or three friends so they could be in neighbouring rooms and have acupuncture together. The insulation wasn’t very good so if I inserted a needle into her friend she would say, “Ow!” and Diana would hear and shout, “Don’t be such a baby.” ’         Diana hitting Prince Charles over the head with a prop glass bottle - one of many practical jokes she pulledMICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘Before an official visit to Spain, there had been rumours of ill health and unhappiness. Filming the princess from behind as she walked down a street in Toledo, her shoulders suddenly started shaking as if she was upset and crying. Members of her party went to her. She kept her face from the camera and I reported that something had happened to make her emotional. I was later told that she had seen something saucy in a shop window and had been trying to stifle her giggles. My report that it was something worse merely made her laugh again.’DR JAMES COLTHURSTDiana’s close confidant and old friend‘When she bought her first car, a blue Honda Civic, I went round to Diana’s with my flatmate at about 11pm and put two L-plates on the car and then tried a string of tins together underneath with enough slack for her to get out of the parking space without disturbing the string, so that when she drove onto Old Brompton Road she was trailing a line of tins behind her. That evening she rang up and I said, “How’s your car?” and she said, “My car’s fine. How’s yours?” I moved to the window and saw my car under the streetlight covered in flour with eggs on top. I had to wash it off quickly, because it goes quite hard. That was fairly much Diana’s line of fun. She was great at one-liners, like when we were on a skiing holiday and I fell asleep with my mouth open. Diana said, “Gosh, James would be a real wower in a goldfish bowl, wouldn’t he?” Her way of phrasing things was funny.’         Diana meeting Australian lifeguards at New South Wales\u0027 Terrigal Beach in 1988JENNI RIVETTPersonal trainer‘We trained in her drawing room at Kensington Palace which was absolutely huge.

Nothing was moving as cars tried to turn right. Suddenly, along the grass verges in front of the suburban semis, the Prince of Wales’s Bentley came bouncing along, up, down and across people’s drives, around parked motorbikes, with the Princess of Wales laughing in the back of the car as if on a scary ride at a fairground.’KEN LENNOXFormer royal photographer‘Visiting the Royal Hampshire Regiment in 1988, she clambered into a tank — a bit like the famous Margaret Thatcher shot, but she was wearing a tracksuit and a military jacket. When she came out, she slid down the tank and I was standing right there. She said to me, “Unfortunately I couldn’t find any ammunition”.’JAYNE FINCHERPhotographer         Diana and Fergie prodding a friend with an umbrella at Royal Ascot in 1987‘She used to get the giggles about things. In Australia in 1988 we were at Bondi Beach and we thought it would be the archetypal lifeguard on the beach picture. When we got there all these scantily clad lifeguards were lined up to meet her, but then the sponsors decided their swimsuits were too scanty so they told them to put their tracksuit bottoms on. Of course we were all horrified because that wasn’t going to make a good picture.As they put their tracksuit bottoms on, we said we were going to go on strike and not take any pictures. So when Diana arrived we were making them take their trousers off again and she could see all this going on. When she came to the beach she started giggling and didn’t know where to look. She looked everywhere other than at those scanty swimsuits. She was posing in the middle of them and looking up at the sky. She was really flushed and got the giggles again — she didn’t want to look down.’NISH JOSHIHolistic health practitioner‘Kevin Costner kept calling her asking her to act in Bodyguard 2, a sequel to his movie with Whitney Houston. She laughed and laughed when she told me, “He keeps calling me wanting me to play the person the bodyguard protected.” She thought it was so funny.’SARAH BRADFORDAlso known as Viscountess Bangor, royal biographer‘I always felt Diana was wary of Fergie and yet when Fergie was turned down as prospective lady-in-waiting for Diana because she was deemed “most unsuitable”, Diana was furious.         Diana and Prince Charles at Prince William\u0027s confirmation ‘There was always trouble afoot when the two women got together, like on Fergie’s hen night when she and Diana wore grey wigs, dressed up as policewomen and pretended to arrest a “prostitute” outside Buckingham Palace. They were put in a police van and driven down The Mall until one of the policemen recognised Diana. He was so shocked he couldn’t believe it and said, “Oh my heavens, it’s the Princess of Wales!”‘Later they went on to Annabel’s nightclub where they narrowly missed Prince Andrew, but they then succeeded in tricking the policemen on the gates at Buckingham Palace and they shut the gates in Andrew’s face as his car approached. Fearing an ambush, he screeched into reverse. That’s when Fergie wondered if she’d gone too far.‘I’ve not been a fan of Fergie’s and none of this would have occurred to Diana without Fergie’s bad influence. A member of staff said Fergie had her own agenda and used to get Diana into trouble and then disappear.’DARREN MCGRADYPersonal chef‘Because we were a small household it was up to Paul Burrell or me to fill her car up with petrol, because she felt vulnerable at the petrol station. She drove a BMW or a Mercedes. So I would drive out through the gate, the police would salute and I would pull faces. I would fill up the car and drive back but I would notice there were chocolate wrappers in the footwell.‘So while I was cooking her healthy food she was sneaking out and having chocolate bars in the car. Every now and again after returning the car I would say, “Your Royal Highness, here are your keys, but I found these in the car”, and hand her the chocolate wrappers.‘And she would say, “Oh they must be William and Harry’s” and smile. Because she knew that I knew! She liked Drifter bars and Time Outs.’MICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘It was customary to meet the Press at the start of a royal tour. In the British ambassador’s residence in Washington in 1985, the princess stood in the receiving line as familiar faces presented themselves, fresh from covering the Queen’s tour of the Caribbean. “Now, let’s see all these glorious suntans,” cried the princess in triumph. “Not much work has been done in the West Indies, that’s for sure.” I told her it was rust, not suntan, as it had rained throughout the Queen’s tour. “I am sure someone believes that,” said the princess. “But it’s not me”.’         Diana and Prince Charles share a post-polo kiss.

It was a Thursday, Ladies’ Day at Ascot, and these two girls were waving at me. I thought, “Well I can’t know those girls they can’t be waving at me,” so I looked the other way.‘Anyway, later when I was at KP doing a fitting I realised it was Diana and Fergie on their way to Ascot who’d waved at me. Diana said to me, “Are you still riding your bike?” I said, “Oh, yes, yes,” and she said, “I hope it disguises you more than when I go to things!” ’RICHARD YOUNGPhotographer‘I used to go to San Lorenzo restaurant a lot because I knew the owners. I’d be sitting there having lunch on my own — crudites and calamari — and a few times Diana came in to meet friends, and as she walked past my table she’d nick a carrot and say, “Oh, Mr Young, how are you?” ’MICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘Diana was shopping in Harrods in 1996 wearing the most elegant Yves St Laurent trouser suit that accentuated her height. There had been some photographs of her rapidly growing sons in the papers which prompted me to say, “You’ve certainly bred some height into the Royal Family.” She stopped and said, “And good looks, Michael, and good looks!” She wagged her finger to emphasise the point. She was proud of her Spencer genes and antecedents as a direct descendant of King Charles II.’         Former royal photographer Ken Lennox says \u0027Diana was a bold girl, and I think Charles found her too difficult\u0027JAYNE FINCHER Photographer‘She was always a bit suspicious when women reporters came along, new ones that she didn’t know. She’d say, “Oh watch that one, she’ll be fluttering her eyelashes at my security staff. And look, she’s got awful shoes from Russell \u0026amp Bromley.” Woman to woman, we’d laugh about that.’JENNI RIVETTPersonal trainer‘I didn’t realise I was supposed to curtsy to her, and one day we bumped into her best friend Julia Samuel in Kensington Gardens and she curtsied to her. I was a bit surprised, and I asked Julia why she was curtsying to her best friend. She said, “I’m not curtsying to her, I’m curtsying to the Crown and so should you.”‘So the next time I saw Diana I apologised and said, “I believe I’m supposed to curtsy to you — so I owe you four years of curtsies.” She said, “That’s why I love you Jenni, because you’re South African and you don’t know about these things. Don’t worry.” She really took people at face value — she used to take off my accent and talk like a South African, and say things like, “Yeeees Jeeeni”. She was very funny.’KEN LENNOXFormer royal photographer‘Diana was a bold girl, and I think Charles found her too difficult. Whereas Camilla was totally acquiescent to everything Charles wanted or said or did, Diana was a young girl with different ideas. If I turned up at something I wasn’t supposed to turn up to, she would point her finger at me and wag it, but it was always with a smile on her face.       ‘She had absolutely perfect manners and a great sense of giggles too. We used to say, though, that when she was upset about something, her laser eyes would be switched on.’MICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘Although they did fall out from time to time, and were in or out of favour with the Press, Princess Diana and the Duchess of York were friends from way back and Fergie was always up for any devilment that occurred to Diana, like livening up an afternoon at Royal Ascot by poking the royal equerry Major Hugh Lindsay in the back with their parasols when they spotted him walking along to the paddock.’MICHAEL WHITLAMFormer director general of the British Red Cross‘On a trip to Washington about six weeks before she died she invited me to have tea with her. She had the room below mine and one of the staff came and said, “Diana would like you to join her and the ambassador’s wife for tea.”‘So I went downstairs to where her living room was. She was sitting there with the ambassador’s wife, in her dressing gown and with white stuff all over her face. I, of course, blushed and looked incredibly embarrassed, and they thought this was highly amusing and spent the next two hours ribbing me about it — “Come join the girls,” she said. “Come join the girls for some girly chat”.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Shocking moment two year old girl tumbles 10 feet sewer","story":"Share this article The shocked mother rushes to the sewer apparently shouting to the workers who immediately rescue the child.According to reports, the girl was rushed to hospital in a state of shock and diagnosed with severe bruises to her right hand.

That was 5,000 square feet. Then I moved into our other house in London, which was 20,000 square feet.\u0027She added: \u0027I know that the house is huge, and yes, it really is quite overwhelming, but with the other houses we looked at that were a similar size to this, you felt like you were in a museum. \u0027She moved into the sprawling 56,500-square-foot chateau, known as The Manor, but insisted on an extensive refurbishment.The previous owner had a bowling alley, a room dedicated specifically to cutting flowers and even an entire climate-controlled chamber for storing silver, in the property.The house also included a barbershop, multiple gift-wrapping rooms, and a French wine and cheese room, complete with French music and side-walk tables.But Petra was not a fan of the decor and embarked on a huge redesign that took more than nine weeks and required 500 workmen.          Petra took ownership of the home that comes with a swimming pool (pictured) after a chaotic period in her personal life, during the collapse of her marriage to James Stunt         The Manor is the largest home in LA and among the largest single-family homes in the entire country, measuring more than 1,500 feet larger than the White HouseCandyland’s former wrapping rooms have since been swapped out for a hair salon and massage parlor.There’s also a tanning room, solarium and a games room.

It’s about a depressed young American woman called Millie, who works in a depressing temp job, while spiralling into even greater depression at the prospect that the job might become permanent. It is also bleakly funny: “I think I’m drawn to temp work for the slight atmospheric changes,” Millie writes. “The new offices and coworkers provide a nice illusion of variety. Like how people switch out their cats’ wet food from Chicken to Liver to Sea Bass, but in the end, it’s all just flavored anus.”Butler’s debut, Jillian, also used the office as a backdrop. Such a setting could be considered brave for a novelist: most jobs are tedious, to complain at length about how tedious they are can be even more so. Nor, in these precarious times, is the “I hate my job” lament in short supply. Yet the generation that graduated into a recession has also been sold the lie that you have to “love what you do”. How to square that with the monotonous pointlessness of most office work? Butler paints it as a kind of spiritual death: “Back at my desk I sit and slowly collect money that I can use to pay the rent on my apartment and on food so that I can continue to live and continue to come to this room and sit at this desk and slowly collect money.”Her coping mechanisms are alcohol, back-to-back episodes of true-crime TV, deadpan humour and delicious hostility. Of an obnoxious colleague: “I fold my hands in my lap and re-create him in my mind … his young girlfriend’s jaw setting compulsively when she smells his breath, his father’s dying words (I wish you had been less of a dick) …”Millie is from the now well-established school of the privileged antiheroine. She is not quite as loathsome as Ottessa Moshfegh’s protagonist in My Year of Rest and Relaxation, though her parents pay for her apartment and she is a horrible snob, tearing down an acquaintance for using “utilise” in conversation (“it’s a real first-gen-college-grad kind of word, like your parents are small-town conservative Christians who didn’t have any books in the house”). When the reader starts to feel compassion for Millie, it feels like a literary feat. That place of tension between the expectations of privilege and the colourless reality of life in an advanced service economy is fertile territory for art and comedy. Capitalism makes people behave odiously, the office becoming a backdrop for petty acts of psychopathy, revenge and narcissism, but opting out, or trying to, comes at a price. It’s the only reality we know. And that is a depressing thought. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s The Tyranny of Lost Things is published by Sandstone. The New Me is published by Orion (£8.99).

Our landmass may be modest in size but is latticed with a generous 140,000 miles of public footpaths, bridleways and byways, and exploring them is one of our favourite pastimes.It wasn’t always so. Before the late 18th century most people walked only because they had to, or if they were on pilgrimage. Walking was the preserve of the horseless poor. With the rise of the Romantic movement came the idea of walking for pleasure, prompting such poets as Wordsworth to some of their finest words after traipsing the countryside on foot.So began the great British tradition of walking, and writing about it. Some authors have accomplished arduous hikes in far-flung lands others have written just as engagingly about journeys much closer to home. Take Robert Louis Stevenson. Famously, he tramped with a donkey across the mountains of the Cévennes, though it is his gentler ramble across the Chiltern Hills that is the focus of my book, The Country of Larks.Non-fiction accounts such as Stevenson’s make up the majority of books about walking in Britain, although fictional narratives have their place too – as do walks in less bucolic landscapes. Today, it seems no topography is too pedestrian to induce British authors to lace up their boots and take to the byways (and sometimes the highways) of our country. Here are my 10 favourites.1. Journey Through Britain by John HillabySometime before 1968, when the book was first published, explorer John Hillaby set off with a backpack to walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats, preparing for his 1,100-mile hike across Britain as rigorously as if he were traversing the Himalayas. Predating today’s emphasis on self-discovery in travel writing, this classic may feel somewhat dated to modern readers. Its appeal lies in the warm and witty evocation of the British countryside and its people, as observed half a century ago.2. As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning by Laurie LeeOne June morning in 1934 the young Lee set forth from the Cotswold village of Slad, where he’d lived for most of his life, to walk to Spain. But before reaching Mediterranean shores, Lee walked through southern England, writing about his wanderings and encounters in characteristically elegiac prose. This was the era when tramps still roved the country lanes, cars were a rarity and Lee was still young and idealistic – before his initiation into the turmoil of the Spanish civil war.3. A Coast to Coast Walk by Alfred WainwrightAmbulatory writers usually follow the old ways – whether trade routes like the Silk Road or pilgrimage trails such as the Camino de Santiago. Alfred Wainwright preferred to plough his own furrow by creating an entirely new approach: a 182-mile walk linking St Bees Head in Cumbria with Robin Hood’s Bay in Yorkshire. Complementing Wainwright’s handwritten instructions and detailed drawings are touches of wit, homespun philosophy and lyricism, giving even the most sedentary reader an appreciation of England’s dramatic northern landscapes.4. The Living Mountain by Nan ShepherdShepherd spent a lifetime exploring the Cairngorms on foot. This impressive mountain range attracts climbers from around the world, yet this is not a book about climbing. Dismissing macho Munro Bagging as “sterile”, Shepherd instead ventures out in all seasons and all weathers (mostly alone and sometimes barefoot) walking not on to the mountains, but “into” them. It is the meditative rhythm of walking that unveils for her the essence of the Cairngorms – mountains that she comes to know as intimately as old friends.5. The Rings of Saturn by WG SebaldWhen WG Sebald took a short walk in the Suffolk countryside he found himself among a burgeoning troupe of literary psychogeographers roaming Britain during the latter half of the 20th century. Modelled on Baudelaire’s concept of the flâneur, the physical journey is less important than the meandering intellectual expedition the narrator takes – in Sebald’s case, one that embraces history, memoir literary criticism and biography. A hybrid of fiction and non-fiction, The Rings of Saturn has influenced a host of 21st-century imitators.6. London Orbital by Iain SinclairTrue to conventional travel writing form, at the heart of this book is a Homeric-style quest: a journey the protagonist is compelled to take, often within a specific timeframe. Less conventionally, the quest undertaken in this book is a Sebaldian stroll around the 117 miles of the M25. Sinclair splendidly unearths an idiosyncratic and multilayered edgeland of industrial parks, shopping centres, housing estates and golf courses encircling the capital at the turn of the millennium.7. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel JoyceJoyce’s novel sees her eponymous antihero set off on a trek across England to deliver a letter to a terminally ill former colleague. This Bunyanesque allegory about a retired brewery manager reflecting on his past while putting one inadequately shod foot in front of another takes on a tragicomic edge as attempts to catch up with him fail. At the heart of the narrative are Harold’s words to his old friend: “I will keep walking, and you must keep living.”8. Nightwalk by Chris YatesUncommonly, the walk described in this spellbinding narrative takes place over just a few short hours, and by moonlight. Setting out from his Dorset home one midsummer evening, Yates encounters the terrain and resident wildlife in its less familiar, nocturnal guise. Despite both the brevity of the walk and the book, as the sun rises you feel you have accompanied the author on a journey into an enchanted world, sharing the sounds, sights and smells that are only revealed after dusk.9. The January Man by Christopher SomervilleInspired by Christy Moore’s folk song of the same name, Somerville embarks on a series of walks over a calendar year in search of his father. Although Somerville the elder is no longer alive, the author unveils the story of their relationship via 12 walks across Great Britain, from the flood plains of the Severn (where Christopher grew up) to the towering sea-cliffs of Foula. The book tenderly blends memoir with descriptions of nature and the passing of the seasons.10. The Salt Path by Raynor WinnFew books about walking are written by women, and even fewer by authors forced to take to the road by the twin misfortunes of sudden homelessness and serious illness. Winn and her husband did just that, packing their few remaining belongings into rucksacks and hiking the 630-mile South West Coast Path. We walk with Ray and Moth every step of the way, sharing the hunger, exhaustion, blazing heat and freezing rain in an account that is both lyrical and inspirational.• The Country of Larks: A Chiltern Journey by Gail Simmons is published by Bradt, priced £11.99.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“I’ve had a bit of a reading glitch the past number of weeks and had been unable to make much headway with whatever I picked up,” says captainlego. But Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast and a trip to Paris solved the problem:I thoroughly enjoyed his recollections of his time in Paris in the early to mid 1920s. As luck would have it I was staying in the 5th Arrondissement, which is where he mainly lived during this period so it was wonderful to be walking the same streets and stopping off in the same cafes.New York in 1872 has grown to a population of almost a million. A freelance journalist goes missing after telling his editor that he just seen his own father, who died the year before, though he had no sort of relationship with him, a man who had earned his fortune running slave boats along the Atlantic Coast. Always there is the spectre of corruption, of bribery and extortion headed by the gangster Boss Tweed. As gripping as the plot is, NY itself is very much the star of the show, a place imprisoned in thuggish corruption, where the police conspire with, rather than against, crime, a maze of alleyways crawling with the street-urchins who survive on the city’s garbage, darting beneath the wheels of carriages, acting as newspaper-sellers, and loitering at the edge of squalid saloons. It is brought wonderfully to life in his writing.Meanwhile, nina1414 takes us to the Dodecanese with Lawrence Durrell and his Reflections On A Marine Venus: A Companion To The Landscape of Rhodes:The best bits were about Durrell and his companions and life on the island of Rhodes when he was sent there in May 1945. They were delightful. My favourite phrase was “ferociously unshaven gentlemen”. I don’t know why - but I was taken by that.At the end, there is a calendar of flowers and saints. And a footnote acknowledges the help of Dr Theodore Stephanides - the Theodore of Corfu, I assume. For some silly reason, it made me happy to see his name. He was such a nice character in the Gerald Durrell books and, from what I can gather, well respected by his fellow Greeks as an academic.The Devil’s Diary by Patrick McGinley has delighted BaddHamster:Set in Donegal in the 1980s it tells of strange goings on in a seaside town. A priest disapproves of modernity and the introduction of a cash economy. His mysterious brother returns from overseas and may or may not be a little mad. And there’s something shady about their childhood days. Beautifully written, you can practically smell the turf fires and the seaspray and a creepy plot that threatens horror with every turn of the page. I’d never read McGinley before, but I’m delighted to make his acquaintance now and roam the spooky hills after dark where all manner of shenanigans may be transpiring, just out of sight.ID583532 “wasn’t looking forward” to reading Welcome to Lagos by Chibundu Onuzo, “but I did and how glad I am that I did”:It was a terrific read! I loved the detail and vibrancy of the description of life in the city of Lagos, the delta and rural regions. The characterisation was excellent and the dynamics of the relationships engaging and convincing. There was no happy ending as such (and how could there be?), but the ending was largely positive and the message hopeful.This year’s Man Booker Prize International winner, Celestial Bodies by Jokha Alharthi, has intrigued Rex Bowan:It started by reminding me of The Waves but by the end, with the village, the confusing shifts in perspective, the barrage of history and madness revealed at the end of the book, it brought Faulkner to mind even more. I was pleased to read something experimental but I didn’t feel like my understanding or knowledge of Oman grew as a result of reading it.Finally, Vicc is “slowly reading” The Narrow Road to the Interior by Matsuo Bashō translated by Sam Hamill:Such a joy. A few words painting wonderful pictures of Japan in the 17th century. Calming and serene with beautiful haiku. Even the difficulties and sadness are something Bashō accepts:Through nine hellish days of heat and rain, all my old maladies tormenting me again, feverish and weak, I could not write. Altair meets Vega tomorrow - Tanabata - already the night is changedWhat an antidote to the world of today.That does indeed sound like a tonic.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The award was intended to compensate him for bonuses he would forfeit by leaving his job as president of the investment bank at Switzerland’s UBS.At the time, the bank said the compensation award was “a sum significantly above the board’s original expectations at the time of the appointment”.“The board considers that for Santander to pay this amount to facilitating the hiring of one inidual, even one of the calibre and background of Mr Orcel, would be unacceptable for a retail and commercial bank such as Santander,” it said.As well as concerns over pay, Orcel clashed with Santander’s executive chairman, Ana Botín, according to the FT, amid disagreement over what level of public profile he would be expected to have at the bank, the eurozone’s largest by market value.The bank’s change of heart meant José Antonio Álvarez remained in the role of chief executive, abandoning plans to transition to the chairman of Santander Spain in March.Orcel, known as a star investment banker at UBS, was due to receive an annual pay package in line with Alvarez, who earned €8.9m in 2017.In an interview with the FT earlier this year, Orcel said: “I’m not known to be a person that lets go, especially when I think the right thing to do is to not let go.”Orcel’s claim is believed to be based on a calculation of his lost earnings, as well as legal fees and other costs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8967b82fa193026fb90d0ac4fd30a8be0ca78f45/271_4_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe1ed6f9d907e22d9e8037cb0749bbf","title":"zdenek hrib the czech mayor who defied china taiwan","story":"By refusing to expel a Taiwanese diplomat, the Prague mayor has joined the ranks of local politicians confronting contentious national policiesZdeněk Hřib had been Prague’s mayor for little more than a month when he came face-to-face with the Czech capital’s complex entanglement with China.Hosting a meeting with foreign diplomats in the city, Hřib was asked by the Chinese ambassador to expel their Taiwanese counterpart from the gathering in deference to Beijing’s ‘one China’ policy, under which it claims sovereignty over the officially independent state of Taiwan.Given recent Chinese investments in the Czech Republic, which have included the acquisition of Slavia Prague football club, a major brewery and a stake in a private TV station, the fledgling mayor could have easily agreed. Prague city council had, under the preceding mayor, signed a twin cities agreement with Beijing that explicitly recognised the one China policy.Instead, Hřib refused and the Taiwanese diplomat stayed.The episode is a rare case of a local politician defying the might of a global superpower while making a principled stand against a national government policy that has promoted Chinese ties.It also adds him to the ranks of mayors who have confronted contentious national policies, including US Democrats such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who have opposed the anti-immigration drive of the US president, Donald Trump, and declared their fiefdoms sanctuary cities.Closer to home, Hřib’s conduct invites comparison with the late mayor of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz, after whom he renamed a Prague street following Adamowicz’s murder in January. Adamowicz offered his city as a haven for refugees and adopted liberal positions at odds with the hardline policies of Poland’s conservative Law and Justice party (PIS) government.Hřib has since gone further, demanding Beijing officials drop the clause stating Prague’s support for the one China policy in the 2016 deal and threatening to scrap the arrangement if they refuse.“This article is a one-sided declaration that Prague agrees with and respects the one China policy and such a statement has no place in the sister cities agreement,” Hřib said in an interview in Prague’s new town hall, close to the city’s historic tourist district, which draws an increasing number of visitors from China.“The one China policy is a complicated matter of foreign politics between two countries. But we are solving our sister cities relationship on the level of two capital cities.”Hřib, a 38-year-old doctor who spent a medical training internship in Taiwan, is challenging the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, who has visited China several times, installed a Chinese adviser at his office in Prague castle and declared that he wanted to learn “how to stabilise society” from the country’s communist rulers.The dispute has catapulted the unassuming Hřib to household name status in Czech politics, helped by Prague’s position as an international cultural draw and its outsize share of national resources.Hřib’s rise from obscurity is striking because Czech mayors, unlike their US and Polish counterparts, are not directly elected. He became mayor of a coalition administration after his Pirate party, a liberal group with roots in civil society, finished second in last October’s municipal elections.He says he is merely adopting the policy of his party and its two coalition partners in taking decisions that are cooling Prague’s relations with Beijing.In March, his administration restored the practice of flying the Tibetan flag from Prague’s town hall, reinstating a tradition begun in the era of the Czech Republic’s first post-communist president, Václav Havel, that was dropped by the previous city administration. At the same time, in a move tailor-made to infuriate Beijing, Hřib hosted the visiting head of Tibet’s government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay.An official visit to the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, followed. During the visit, Hřib criticised China for harvesting organs from political prisoners belonging to the Falun Gong movement.Threats of retaliation came soon afterwards. A planned tour of China by the Prague Philharmonia in September is in jeopardy after it rebuffed Beijing’s demands to repudiate the mayor.Iva Nevoralova, the orchestra’s spokesperson, likened the request to the actions of Czechoslovakia’s former communist regime, which pressured artists to denounce Havel’s dissident Charter 77 movement as the price for being allowed to perform.Speaking to the , Hřib questioned whether Prague’s arrangement with Beijing was a fair relationship and criticised China’s “social scoring” system for good citizenship. He suggested that investment from Taiwan, with its western-style democracy and record of technological innovation, offered greater benefit.The mayor has won praise for restoring the Czech Republic’s image as a champion of human rights and self-determination at a time when its politics have been dominated by the populist messages of Zeman and Andrej Babiš, the anti-immigration billionaire prime minister.“It is empowering to see that a mayor of Prague can have a principled position, despite large portions of the Czech political establishment being co-opted by the narratives spread by the totalitarian government of China,” said Jakub Janda, executive director of the European Values thinktank, which monitors anti-western influence in Czech politics and beyond.Jiří Pehe, the director of New York University in Prague, said Hřib was using the mayor’s office to reassert the values of Havel, who died in 2011. “Everyone in this country knows that when you support Taiwan and Tibet, you’re saying exactly what Havel used to say,” said Pehe. “This was intentional on the part of the Pirate party as soon as he took over Prague. They are saying that the Czech Republic has a special history of fighting against communism and you should respect it.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6480461ef1d8c7c3ca3d68cdd2c7f51d95f2332/0_8_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bd01e8077c931516ca5d4874fef1692","title":"deep seabed off limits mining companies","story":"We still know so little about the wonderful world at the bottom of the oceans. Sending in giant bulldozers is a terrible ideaWhen I was filming Blue Planet Live, I was struck by just how much of the ocean has been altered by humans. From industrial fisheries ensnaring ocean giants in kilometres-long lines, to finding our trash at some of the deepest parts of the ocean: it’s clear that however vast the seas are, we are causing profound harm.Yet at this point in history, when the oceans are facing more pressures than ever before, a secretive new industry is seeking to move into the deep sea, the largest ecosystem on the planet, to start mining for metals and minerals.They want to send gigantic bulldozers, decked out with rotating grinders and mammoth drills straight out of Robot Wars, into the deepest parts of the ocean, disturbing the home of unique creatures and churning up vital stores of carbon. This is quite clearly an awful idea.As someone fascinated by weird and wonderful wildlife, the deep sea is a dream come true. Stoplight loosejaws, bearded sea-devils and vampire squid are just a few of the fantastically named creatures that make the deep ocean their home.On practically every mission down to the deep, scientists discover new species. We know more about the surface of Mars and the moon than about the bottom of the ocean. Mining the deep sea sounds just as ludicrous as mining the moon.And the damage won’t stay hidden in the depths. Toxic pollution from mining operations could travel hundreds or even thousands of miles, impacting the broader ocean food chain. And by disturbing the natural processes that store carbon in deep-sea sediments, deep-sea mining could even make climate change worse. When a million species are already at risk of extinction and climate change is fundamentally altering our planet – why would we sink to new depths, and make it all worse?In fact, with little to no public debate, a handful of governments and corporations have been parcelling up over a million square kilometres of the international seabed to explore for mining potential. As a new report by Greenpeace reveals, there’s very little standing between the natural wonders of the deep ocean and the mining machines: the agency responsible for regulating deep-sea mining (the International Seabed Authority) is putting profit over protection and has never turned down a single licence application.We’ve already seen the huge destruction ravaged upon our planet by corporations mining on land. Are we really prepared to give the go-ahead to the mining industry expanding into a new frontier, where it will be even harder for us to scrutinise the damage caused?Over the next year, governments are negotiating a Global Ocean Treaty at the United Nations, which could agree the framework to put huge swathes of our oceans off-limits to exploitation, and raise the bar for any industrial activity in the global oceans: putting protection at the heart of how we manage international waters and the life-support system they provide for us all. The oceans and the stunning and downright bizarre creatures that live there have an incredible ability to regenerate – but only if we let them be.Yet with industries such as deep-sea mining keen to keep their business unrestricted by environmental protections, it will be an uphill battle to secure a strong global agreement. This is a fight for all of us. The global oceans are legally classified as the common heritage of humankind. That means they belong to us all, including future generations.Oil companies ploughed on to cement themselves in the global political economy despite the risks of climate change. Now the deep-sea mining industry is hoping to establish itself, despite catastrophic risks. Minutes of an industry meeting released to Greenpeace under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that “All agreed that environmental concerns are the biggest blocker to progress.”Well the game’s up. Sending massive destructive machines into the deep ocean that we know so little about is quite clearly a terrible idea. Let’s stop it in its tracks.• Chris Packham is a naturalist, author and TV presenter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b58833749a1bb059755b1d517e7e275e7f4c392/2_0_7107_4267/master/7107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bca589b55f98da15c4f762cba3b1031","title":"how to craft the perfect out of office email so you can holiday in peace","story":"If, like me, you want some uninterrupted time off, writing an effective message is essential.

If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life.

Sadly, it wasn’t a very successful campaign war has remained incomprehensibly popular even as the song itself has become ubiquitous – it topped a 1999 poll to find Britain’s favourite song lyric. Written as the Vietnam war raged, Imagine now seems clearly influenced by Lennon’s wife, Yoko Ono, and her 1964 book Grapefruit, a collection of instructions that stand in for physical artworks. “Imagine the clouds dripping. Dig a hole in your garden to put them in,” run the familiar-sounding instructions for Cloud Piece.Ono wouldn’t be given a songwriting credit on Imagine until 2017, but by 1971 she had already become the most significant artistic influence on Lennon since Chuck Berry. For decades, Ono was vilified by rubber-necking journalists and bitter Beatles fans alike, and her work – encompassing some of the most provocative and original feminist art of the era – was largely ignored. (Lennon once called her “the world’s most famous unknown artist”.) But at the turn of the millennium, the Japanese conceptualist finally began to be recognised as a major artist, with international retrospectives and even a reunion of the Plastic Ono Band, her caterwauling avant-rock ensemble, whose albums repelled 70s critics but inspired a generation of punks such as Sonic Youth.The world’s perception of her may have changed, but today the famously dogged Ono is still banging the same drum – or, more accurately, ringing the same bell. In her latest artwork, she is enlisting thousands of ordinary folk to ring in this year’s Manchester international festival with Bells for Peace, a mass participatory artwork that returns to her most enduring theme.At 6pm on Thursday, Manchester’s Cathedral Gardens will resound with the peals of 4,000 ceramic bells, handmade and engraved for the occasion, along with the mightier clangs of a huge Buddhist bell and antique church bells. Those will be harmoniously tuned, but the festival is also encouraging the public to bring along their own bells: the result, you imagine, will be a kind of joyful discord. (As well as being free and open to the public, the event will also be livestreamed through the MIF website.)Spend some time turning that sentence over in your head, like a Zen koan, and something instructional eventually falls out. The problem with peace, Ono suggests, is that it inevitably struggles to cut through our frantic, accelerated lives it’s our responsibility to make space for peace purposefully, rather than expecting it to come to us. Bells for Peace brings people together in a single moment to pause, reflect and recharge our imaginations.Two years before Lennon wrote Imagine, the newly married couple spent their honeymoon in a hotel bed, surrounded by cameras. Their Bed-Ins for Peace merged Lennon’s rock’n’roll populism with Ono’s avant garde audacity, honed through her radical performances such as Cut Piece, in which she sat calmly as her audience cut off her clothes with scissors. Through the Bed-Ins, John and Yoko merged their life with art and laid the groundwork for the next generation of pop protest, from Red Wedge to Live Aid. When I quiz her on whether art can really bring about political change, there’s still a hint of revolutionary thinking at work. “Art is just part of the world,” she deflects. “We have to rely on people, including yourself. Not government. Governments always have red tape. Our imaginations don’t.”As one of the most visible artists of her generation, Ono’s influence is subtle but huge, running through several generations of younger artists, from the Guerrilla Girls’ feminist critique of the art world, to Marina Abramović’s provocative performances, to the many artists, including Sam Taylor-Johnson, who have made music along with visual art.“As soon as you start becoming aware of the tradition of body art and conceptual art, you realise that a lot of it is rooted in her practice from many decades previously,” says John McGrath, Manchester international festival’s artistic director. At the core of it all is Ono’s conception of art “as something that the public completes – an invitation to the public to make the work with her”.Two years ago, the festival made the decision to kick off with a public event – a commissioned work of art rather than fireworks or fancy ceremony. Jeremy Deller was chosen to initiate this tradition, which he did by inviting 150 Mancunians to walk a fashion runway above the city’s bustling transport hub, Piccadilly Gardens. Painting a portrait of Manchester through its people – dog walkers, doctors, a cab driver who offered free rides after the terror attack at Manchester Arena in 2017 – the commission had “an extraordinary response,” says McGrath.Ono was the obvious choice to continue this new tradition. After gauging her interest, McGrath soon found himself in Ono’s living room in the Dakota Building, the New York block where she has lived since 1973. “What we really wanted was what she became excited about,” says McGrath, “which was a mass participatory artwork. One of the things she always said is that peace isn’t absence of war – peace is a thing that you have to do, together, and the ringing of bells together is her expression of that.”Ono breezes through the rest of my questions. What’s the best thing about being in your 80s? “By then you will know how to live.” When was the last time a work of art affected you deeply? “I feel that a work of art, depending on how you see it, affects us all the time. The beautiful sky, like today.” What can I do to boost my imagination? “You are already improving.” Glad to hear it.Working with an artist who makes a virtue of deflection comes with its challenges. “You ask a question and the answer you get isn’t necessarily the practical, head-on answer,” says McGrath with a chuckle. “Sometimes the answers require some thought and interpretation. But then she’ll make these leaps – I sat there in one meeting with quite a few people and we were talking about the whole ethos of peace behind the work, and suddenly she says: ‘Maybe we’re going to end up with too much peace and we’ll need some revolution instead!’ So she also has that capacity to turn the thing on its head. There isn’t Yoko Ono the work separate to Yoko Ono the person. How she exists in the world is very much an embodiment of the work that she makes.”Whether she’s issuing art instructions by tweet, inviting us to write down our wishes and hang them on a tree, or daring us to slice off her clothes, Ono’s work is always an attempt to pull people towards each other, simultaneously cracking open our fears and desires. The phrase “audience participation” can strike fear into the hearts of uptight unbelievers, but for Ono there’s nothing better, as she notes with bitesize wisdom: “Because when 20 birds are singing, it’s very beautiful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb4c84e10525bb7a8edc5040f88f7c6cb040afa/0_7_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c69065a20512e025bffbd6afd12c783c","title":"ontario the year round holiday destination","story":"Hikers, bikers and wine aficionados will find something to love in Ontario.

Queues are much shorter at major attractions such as Niagara Falls, so why not take a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, a ride on Niagara Helicopters or a thrilling MistRider zipline ride? The spring weather is ideal for bike tours of Niagara’s wineries, distilleries and craft breweries, such as Niagara Oast House Brewers.If you would like to see where maple syrup comes from, around March is the time to join a Sugar Bush tour to see how the trees are tapped or find a pancake festival in April to enjoy the end product. This season is also a good time to go hiking before the crowds come out and the weather heats up. The Bruce Trail (Unesco biosphere designated) stretches from the Niagara Escarpment to Tobermory, 500 miles of scenic trails, while you don’t even need to leave Toronto to hike the forested slopes of the 16 hectare (40-acre) High park.Summer unofficially starts on the third weekend of May with the Victoria Day holiday marking Queen Victoria’s birthday. It’s the start of cottage season, when all roads lead to Georgian Bay, Muskoka or Lake Simcoe, for barbecues, watersports and weekend partying at Ontarians’ seasonal residences. With the weather hot and humid, Ontario has endless supplies of water to cool off in paddle or cruise around the 1,000 Islands near Kingston, sail on the Great Lakes, or enjoy a canoe or kayak adventure on one of the many lakes or rivers in Muskoka. Whitewater raft just 90 minutes from Ottawa, along the Ottawa River or take a LeBoat cruiser along the Rideau canal to Kingston.Don’t miss the waterways of Algonquin park – Justin Trudeau spent his childhood summers here.

Then Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron in Northern Ontario is the place to be, with over 800km of road-biking routes.Summer is the peak season for festivals – starting with the major fun around Canada Day on 1 July anywhere in Ontario, and then you have choices that range from the Niagara wine festival to TIFF (Toronto international film festival), taking in Nuit Blanche art projects at major art venues, and even music and food truck festivals. Let’s not forget Glengarry Highland Games, the Whitchurch-Stouffville strawberry festival and the Toronto Summerlicious food festival, where more than 200 restaurants offer specially priced set menus, among many others.As the leaves start to fall, enjoy the abundance of colours in Ontario’s thousands of miles of forest. Allow two weeks for a proper fly-drive tour from Toronto of highlights including Niagara, Blue Mountain, Muskoka, Algonquin park, Ottawa, 1,000 Islands and Prince Edward County. September and October are also prime times for spotting the northern lights ride the Polar Bear Express  from Cochrane to Moosonee for your best chance of catching this natural phenomenon.In Ottawa, this is a good time to visit the National Gallery of Canada, the city’s premier art collection, or the fascinating Canadian Museum of History, the most visited museum in the country. Take a cycle tour to explore the capital’s many interesting neighbourhoods such as Byward Market and Centretown, indulge in a craft brewery tour or a food tour (or both!). Overindulgence in good food and drink peaks around Canada’s Thanksgiving in October. Major events to look out for include the Blue Mountains apple harvest festival, Bala cranberry festival, and Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest. Many small towns have their own homely harvest and pumpkin festivals, complete with family fun such as traditional music and ploughing matches.As the snowfall peaks, ice hockey fills the TV schedules but it’s even more fun to get out and enjoy the winter wonderland for yourself. This is the time of year when the mist and spray off Niagara Falls freezes on the rocks, adding to the spectacle. For skiing, Blue Mountain is Ontario’s largest resort and great for beginners. Resorts in the Blue Mountain region or Muskoka, such as the luxurious JW Marriott Rosseau, Sherwood Inn, and Cedar Grove Lodge, or Deerhurst in Huntsville offer activities including cross-country skiing, skating, snow shoeing, snowmobiling and dog sledding, with a whole menu of spa treatments to ease any tired muscles.Ontario’s many spas include award-winning ones in Niagara and Prince Edward County, perfect for a break at any time of year but even cosier when the weather is chilly outside. At St Anne’s spa, 90 minutes from Toronto, you can even get wrapped in hot chocolate. For festive festivals, look out for Winterlude in Ottawa, with ice-carving, skating and curling the Icewine festival in Niagara Falls (which also celebrates its food), Winterlicious in Toronto (more seasonal culinary delights!), and Sault Sainte Marie’s Winter Carnival Bon Soo, complete with polar bear swims (where you swim like one, through an ice hole, rather than with one).Discover more of what Ontario has on offer all year round with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

They are dissuaded as it is too challenging - even at foundation - and not seen as relevant for them.”Teresa Tinsley, the report’s lead researcher, said the results suggested that language learning in England’s schools was becoming increasingly segregated along socio-economic and academic lines.“Pupils from poorer backgrounds and those who are less academically inclined are much less likely than their peers to acquire any substantial language skills or access foreign cultures in any significant way, challenges that Brexit looks to exacerbate,” she said.“We all know the pressures schools are under, but these inequalities are not good for our society or the future of our country.”Teachers have long complained about the perceived difficulty of gaining high marks in modern foreign languages, especially at A-level, with concerns that results are skewed by the current grading system putting non-native speakers at a disadvantage.The report found that “very few” state secondary schools allowed pupils to study a language other than French, German or Spanish. In state primary schools, language teaching is often “ad hoc and minimal,” it said. “Languages are often seen as lower priority than other subjects and may be pushed out of the timetable, for example during Sats exams in year six,” it noted.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are in danger of becoming a monolinguistic country unless we do something to rejuvenate the love and learning of languages.“Schools are also struggling with a severe shortage of language teachers and Brexit could worsen this situation because many of our language teachers come from EU countries.”Ofqual, the exams regulator for England, said it was already conducting a review of grading in GCSE French, German and Spanish. “We take seriously concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects and continue to look at this issue in detail,” a spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3e977d0218b1c143c21c6a1f07ca5bd177e2962/0_243_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa223908b947ece2f2accecac191ad78","title":"deep sea mining to turn oceans into new industrial frontier","story":"Greenpeace report reveals 29 floor-exploration licences have been granted worldwideThe world’s oceans are facing a “new industrial frontier” from a fledgling deep-sea mining industry as companies line up to extract metals and minerals from some of the most important ecosystems on the planet, a report has found.The study by Greenpeace revealed that although no mining had started on the ocean floor, 29 exploration licences had been issued covering an area five times bigger than the UK. Environmentalists said the proposed mining would threaten not only crucial ecosystems but the global fight against climate breakdown.Louisa Casson, an ocean campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “The health of our oceans is closely linked to our own survival. Unless we act now to protect them, deep-sea mining could have devastating consequences for marine life and humankind.”The licences, issued by a United Nations body, the International Seabed Authority, have been granted to a handful of countries that sponsor private companies. They cover vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, totalling 1.3m sq km (500,000 sq miles).If the mining goes ahead, large machines will be lowered on to the seabed to excavate cobalt and other rare metals.Campaigners said that, as well as destroying little understood regions of the ocean floor, the operations would deepen the climate emergency by disrupting carbon stores in seafloor sediments, reducing the ocean’s ability to store it.The industry has said deep-sea mining is essential to extract the materials needed for a transition to a green economy by supplying raw materials for key technologies including batteries, computers and phones. Its advocates say deep-sea mining is less harmful to the environment and workers than most existing mineral and mining operations.However, the report said: “The deep-sea mining industry presents its development as essential for a low-carbon future, yet this claim is not substantiated by actors in the renewable energy, electric vehicle or battery sectors. Such arguments ignore calls for a move from the endless exploitation of resources to a transformational and circular economy.”The environmentalist Chris Packham, writing in the , said deep-sea mining posed a serious threat to global oceans.“We’ve already seen the huge destruction ravaged upon our planet by corporations mining on land. Are we really prepared to give the go-ahead to the mining industry expanding into a new frontier, where it will be even harder for us to scrutinise the damage caused?”The report called on governments to agree on a strong global ocean treaty in the next 12 months, citing scientists, governments, environmentalists and representatives of the fishing industry, who warned of the threat posed by deep-sea mining to marine life.The report said the UK government held licences to exploit more of the international seabed than any government apart from China. It accused ministers of positioning the government as a leader on marine protection while simultaneously investing in deep-sea mining.Casson said: “We need the UK government to show strong global leadership and champion ocean protection. They have backed the call for global action to safeguard our oceans but they are also a leading advocate for deep-sea mining. Such hypocrisy is unacceptable.”A government spokesperson said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep sea mineral extraction. We have sponsored two exploration licences, which allows scientific marine research to fully understand the effects of deep sea mining and we will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba427e347dbb3364d18bd02f352494990310cd8/79_0_2342_1405/master/2342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d77faec813e368fda4dfeb6cf1dc77d","title":"gas and oil firms reclassified under non renewables on lse ftse","story":"Trade group says change may have opposite intended effect towards low carbon futureOil and gas companies listed on the London Stock Exchange have been reclassified under a non-renewable energy category in a move designed to distinguish between heavily polluting companies and greener producers.The change has been made by the index provider FTSE Russell, which now groups companies such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Cairn Energy, Petrofac, Premier Oil and Tullow Oil, formerly labelled oil and gas producers, in the non-renewable energy sector.

There are no UK companies listed under renewable energy.Susan Quintin, the managing director of product management at FTSE Russell, said the changes to the industry classification benchmark would provide “greater visibility to other forms of energy such as renewables”.However, the trade body Oil \u0026amp Gas UK expressed concern over the re-labelling, saying many oil and gas companies were broadening their strategies.“Any change to classification has to recognise that many oil and gas companies have a ersity of energy interests and are active right across the energy spectrum,” said Mike Tholen, the group’s upstream policy director.“We would hope that any change which seeks to help the advance to a low carbon future does not have unintended consequences which might in fact slow down the pace of change, having the opposite effect of what it’s set out to do.”It comes after Norway gave the go-ahead for its $1tn sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, to undertake the largest fossil fuel estment to date by ditching more than $13bn of investments in coal and oil producers. It uses the FTSE Russell classification system as the basis for its estment decisions.The classification of a company is based on its main source of revenue. Oil and gas companies would have to invest substantial sums in greener revenue streams to escape the “non-renewable” category. recently updated its style guide to ensure the language it uses about the environment more accurately reflects the scale of change.

Do by all means suggest more in the comments below.This is perhaps the most common myth, possibly because critics confuse what feels like it’s true with what actually is true: the assumption that if you take some road space from motor vehicles, you get more traffic jams – as with (a commonly used parallel) forcing water down a smaller pipe.But fluid and traffic are not the same thing, as shown by 60 years of governments trying and failing to road-build their way out of congestion. The idea of induced demand – more road space brings more cars – has been known for decades, and it also works in reverse. This is especially so with bike lanes, which are such an efficient use of the same space that they can often mean the same amount of space carrying more people overall.Yes, traffic jams have worsened in some cities where bike lanes have been built, but studies show this is largely down to other factors, for example the growth in the number of Uber-type private hire vehicles and Amazon delivery vans.Most compelling of all, of course, is the fact that motor vehicles cause the congestion in the first place, and the only real way to reduce traffic congestion is to have fewer of them on the roads.It seems that on Twitter you’re never more than 10 minutes away from seeing a bike lane critic post a photo of an empty cycle route with the triumphant message: “See?!” Often this is just a cunningly timed picture, but other factors are at play, not least the efficiency of cycle lanes, which means any “traffic” tends to rapidly bunch up at red lights.Around the world, in just about every city where proper cycle routes have been built, many more riders start using them. One classic example is Seville in southern Spain, where the recent construction of 50 miles of bike lanes led to an 11-fold increase in rider numbers.The myth-busting here comes in two parts: first, it’s not as true as some argue, and second, where it is an issue, this is a sign that you need more safe cycling routes, not fewer.But yes, poorer people and those from minority ethnic backgrounds do ride bikes. Transport for London statistics show the ethnic mix of the city’s cyclists roughly matches that of the population. In the US, the group most like to cycle (or walk) to work are those from households with incomes of less than $10,000 (£7,930) a year – ie the very poor.The other thing to stress is that the more obviously safe the cycling in your town or city, the more erse and mixed the people on bikes. Without proper infrastructure, cycling becomes something of a specialist pursuit, mainly restricted to what you might call the hobbyists – people with the more expensive bike, the greater confidence and the willingness to mix it with motor traffic.The converse is seen in places such as the Netherlands and Denmark: while “cyclists” – people who have a drawerful of Lycra and an interest in gear ratios – do exist, they’re a different breed from the mass of everyday transport riders, who in socioeconomic terms encompass more or less everyone from royalty downwards.A series of barely connected bike lanes, such as in London, might be fine for commuters but people who make more varied journeys – for example those (disproportionately women) who need to go to work via a school and back via a shop – require a coherent network, including the other half of the safe-cycling equation, tamed backstreets, where cars are reduced in number and travel at slow speeds.Some of the noisiest opponents of recent London bike lanes have been inidual business owners, who argue that a separated bike lane and any loss of parking will be fatal to their enterprise.In broad terms, however, this is completely wrong. Towns, cities and inidual high streets are changing in how they compete. The growth of internet shopping means they must appeal more as destinations, which is hard to do amid wall-to-wall traffic.Studies have shown that shop owners tend to overestimate the proportion of customers who arrive by car, and that consumers on bikes often purchase more in the long term.Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the real-world impact of cycle lanes, undertaken in New York City, found businesses on streets with separated bike routes grew on average more quickly than those without. In contrast, I know of no evidence that points the other way.A surprisingly common charge – surprising in that it has absolutely no basis in logic, let alone reality. Sure, some elements of cycle lane design might seem new to Britons – for example, “floating” bus stops where passengers cross a cycle lane to reach them – but when they’re designed well there is no evidence they cause danger.More basically, there’s no getting away from the fact that motor vehicles are much, much, much more dangerous. On average each year in the UK between zero and two pedestrians die after being hit by bikes. About 400 a year die after being hit by motor vehicles, including more than 60 struck while on the pavement.As cannot be repeated enough, this is not about cyclists being somehow morally pure. It’s just physics. It’s possible to kill or maim someone if you are a 100kg-ish bike-and-human combination travelling at 12mph, but is extremely unlikely. In a 1.5-tonne SUV at 35mph, it is hideously easy.This is such a silly idea it’s baffling that it still needs regular debunking. People break road laws, on all forms of road transport, and if anything they do so more often on average in motor vehicles.See also: “My 85-year-old granny has two plastic hips and walks with a Zimmer frame – how do you expect her to ride everywhere?”The most tempting response to this is a deep sigh: no one to my knowledge has suggested that if you build safe cycling routes, that will be the only form of transport on offer, let alone compulsory. And while there’s a wider case for removing private cars from urban areas, even if you build cycling infrastructure then roads and cars – as well as buses – will still exist. They will also move more freely for those who really need them.Regarding heavy loads: again, no one says all road freight must vanish. But it’s also worth noting that cargo bikes or trailers, especially with electric-assist, can carry heavy loads – even that hypothetical fridge. Some tradespeople, even supermarkets, already use cargo bikes, particularly in big cities where distances are shorter and parking scarce. More widely there is huge potential scope for “last mile” deliveries, especially of Amazon-size packages, to be moved from vans to cargo bikes.The slightly trite riposte is that at one point even the Netherlands was not the Netherlands. In the early 1970s the Dutch had some of the worst cycling casualty rates in the world, as roads used for decades by cyclists were filled with more and more cars. This prompted a mass protest movement, the result of which was 40-plus years of building safe infrastructure. Ultimately, it’s about political will.See also: “But the NetherlandsDenmark are flat.” Yes, they are, though a classic Dutch headwind can feel like riding up a steep incline. But this is also by no means a deal breaker, especially in the e-bike era. Bristol, for example, has relatively high rates of cycling for the UK, and it’s not exactly flat.See also: “Ah, but LondonEdinburghyou name it are old cities with narrow streets.” This is perhaps the most desperate plea of the lot. It’s not as if Amsterdam or Copenhagen are Milton Keynes.Amazingly, this does get said, often accompanied by the curiously enduring myth that cyclists “don’t pay for the roads”.As Chris Boardman, the cycle campaigner turned cycle tsar for Greater Manchester, noted last month, his planned revamp of the region would cost £1.5bn and would deliver 1,800 miles of safer cycling. That might sound a lot, he said, until you remember that the government has agreed to spend £1.4bn improving a single roundabout in Bedfordshire. So yes, by transport standards, cycling is an absolute bargain.This is, in effect, the message of the critics: not this, not now – let’s try to get away with unambitious schemes without proper infrastructure, which will never change much.You could write a whole column – even a book – about why this is absurd, but it’s always worth stressing this point to the cycling naysayers: OK, what’s your solution to gridlock, pollution, a climate emergency to cities that are noisy, dangerous and unjust? They will not respond, because there is no answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/355227d380afb0b675233291dd59e26004184671/1435_517_1518_911/master/1518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c4d9b274567a7f5d3a8378d895538b","title":"lottie moss outfit want ex to see you wearing sister kate","story":"Kate Moss’s younger half-sister says she is usually happiest in flat shoes and a big leather jacket, but enjoyed dressing as her ‘sophisticated alter-ago’ at the V\u0026ampAThis is the look I wore to the opening of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the V\u0026ampA in London at the beginning of the year.

The outtakes regularly make fun of Hollywood and the film industry more broadly.The now deleted scene from the 1999 film featured the character Stinky Pete the Prospector, a small, rotund, bearded toy, caught chatting salaciously to two Barbie dolls, stroking their hands and suggesting he could get them a part in the next movie.The scene reflects the practice within the entertainment industry of executives and men with power requesting or demanding sex acts from subordinates in exchange for career opportunities or promotion. The practice gained widespread condemnation after the #MeToo movement, particularly after the allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple women against film mogul Harvey Weinstein.The scene deletion was discovered last month by users in online forums and sites like reddit, and reported by the independent film site Rereleasenews. It reportedly affects both Blu-Ray and download versions.The deletion also comes after Pixar Animation Studios co-founder and Walt Disney Company animation chief John Lasseter permanently parted ways from Disney at the end of last year in the wake of the #MeToo movement, after allegations of misconduct and what he referred to as unspecified “missteps” in his behaviour towards colleagues.Lasseter, who directed Toy Story 2, said in a statement in November 2017 that it had been brought to his attention that he had made some colleagues “feel disrespected or uncomfortable”.“I especially want to apologise to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he said. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.”The Toy Story franchise has been one of Pixar and Disney’s most successful, in terms of both box office takings and critical acclaim. The first film in the series was released in 1995. Disney purchased Pixar Animation Studios in 2006.The most recent instalment of the series, Toy Story 4, was released in June. It was not without its own controversies, with Parks and Recreation star Rashida Jones quitting her writing role on the film, citing “philosophical differences” over a lack of ersity at Pixar.Disney has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd1901e326e69c624b6cd2032fdba1bcc2e0b7fe/0_6_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6281de191a4b297c31c2e2be173180a6","title":"kim joys recipe for duck pond themed pavlova","story":"Dive into a luxury cream and coulis-filled meringue, with suitably quackers decorationIf you can make a pavlova (or even if you haven’t made meringue before), you can definitely make this decorated version.

Fluffy, yet deliciously sticky, it’s a proper crowdpleaser.175g butter, softened, plus a little extra to grease2 unwaxed lemons175g caster sugarFine salt3 eggs100g self-raising flour75g ground almondsA little milk100g demerara sugarGrease a 2lb loaf tin (ie, one measuring about 23cm x 13cm x 7cm) with butter or oil, and line with greaseproof paper. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.Zest the lemons – if you haven’t got unwaxed (or organic) ones, give them a good scrub with hot water to remove some of the wax first, because this will give a better flavour.If you’ve forgotten to take the butter out of the fridge, cut it into cubes and leave it near the warm oven or give it a few good whacks with a rolling pin to help it on its way. (Microwaving will just melt the outside, which isn’t ideal.) Put the cubed butter in a large bowl, or in the bowl of a food mixer, with the caster sugar, a pinch of fine salt and half the lemon zest.Use electric beaters to beat the butter and sugar mix until it’s really light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary this should take about five minutes. You can do this with a wooden spoon, but it will take a while, because you want to get as much air into the mix as possible.Beat together the eggs in a jug, then beat them into the butter and sugar mixture a little at a time, making sure each addition is thoroughly incorporated before adding any more. If the mixture threatens to curdle at any point, add a little of the flour to bring it back to a smooth consistency.Tip the flour into a sieve and sift it on top of the butter and sugar mixture – though this is not vital, it will help to give a lighter, fluffier result, so I’d recommend it. Use a large metal spoon gently to fold in the flour with a slow, figure-of-eight motion, being careful to knock as little air out of the mix as possible.Put the ground almonds in a bowl, give them a quick whisk to break up any lumps, then fold into the batter in the same way as the flour. Gradually mix in just enough milk to thin down the batter to a consistency that will reluctantly drop off a spoon.Pour the batter into the prepared tin and gently level the top. Put in the hot oven and bake for about 50-55 minutes, or until the top is golden and risen, and a skewer pushed into the centre comes out clean, or at least without any wet batter clinging to it a few crumbs are fine.Juice both lemons and mix this with the demerara sugar and the remaining lemon zest. Leave the cake in the tin, and poke small holes evenly all over the top, then pour over the drizzle bit by bit, waiting for it be absorbed before adding any more. Leave the cake to cool in its tin before turning out.This cake is an easy one to customise: swap lemon for other citrus fruits or add a dash of gin or vodka to the drizzle or make a spiced version by bringing the demerara sugar to a boil with 100ml water, the lemon zest and a tablespoon of squashed cardamom pods until the sugar dissolves, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse while the cake bakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00da6633319cb5f6615480e9b700750e60bcc354/0_187_1281_768/master/1281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d57d4c45e27a28e4247eb9a5a47a4a","title":"alex morgan tea celebration usa england womens world cup","story":"Alex Morgan has explained her tea-sipping goal celebration which provoked controversy during the USA’s World Cup semi-final victory over England.The US forward raised her fingers to her lips, miming a sip of tea, after scoring the decisive goal in her team’s 2-1 win.Immediately after the game she would not give specifics on what was behind it but later she said: “I feel like we didn’t take an easy route through this tournament and ‘that’s the tea’.”The term ‘tea’ is often used to refer to gossip, with ‘sipping tea’ meaning learning about gossip – as in sipping or drinking in the information. Influencers and show hosts such as RuPaul use this understanding of tea to discuss celebrity scandals, saying “here’s the tea” to mean “here’s the gossip”.Morgan also said: “I know Megan Rapinoe has the best celebration. I had to try and step up this game.” Rapinoe celebrated her goals against France by standing with arms outstretched.Morgan’s pose prompted a variety of suggestions regarding its meaning. Public opinion seemed to be balanced between the motion being a shot at England’s fondness for tea a reference to the ease with which Morgan scored a tribute to the Boston Tea Party or the fact that Morgan’s goal came on her 30th birthday. Piers Morgan called it “a declaration of war”, while Hillary Clinton said “congrats to the USWNT for earning that tea”.The US had already attracted criticism for what some perceived as overcelebration when they beat Thailand 13-0.

There were clear penalties, on Nicolas Otamendi, on Sergio Agüero.Despite the result, Messi was proud of his teammates and believes there is a bright future ahead for Argentina.The Barcelona striker said: “It was the best match we did in the Copa, against a Brazil that has spectacular players in all its lines. These guys made a huge sacrifice. They deserve respect. Argentina has the material to keep growing.”Dani Alves admitted Brazil had needed to dig deep to secure the result. The captain said: “Argentina were a very difficult opponent. We needed to make a barbaric effort. It’s one more step towards our goal. Everything we aimed for from the beginning we are fulfilling but we knew it would not be easy.

And it is yet more evidence for boroughs across London that investing in walking and cycling infrastructure works – getting more people healthy and active as part of their everyday routine, and making our streets cleaner, greener and safer.”Sam Jones, of Cycling UK, said: “The important thing is getting protected space and routes where people feel safe.”He added: “Any growth in cycling is a good thing, but we’re clearly a long way from when women, children and the elderly feel comfortable and safe enough to make those shorter local journeys – whether those are to the shops, school, education – all of which are needed not just to increase the ersity of people who are cycling but also the amount of people cycling.”Fran Graham, the campaigns coordinator of the London Cycling Campaign, said: “Time and time again, evidence shows that if you create the conditions that mean people feel safe cycling, they will. But the mayor has a way to go before London is known as a ‘byword for cycling’ – it’s why it is so important that he hits his target to triple protected cycle track by the end of his term.”She added: “Borough councils also have a large part to play – the recent actions of Kensington and Chelsea to oppose walking and cycling improvements are holding London back, stopping it from becoming a world-class cycling city.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6632ddd5458131bf85c7f043bea88212e95a25ba/0_302_4962_2977/master/4962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88195391ca8cbf4f9c00b66ee1b77b51","title":"from first period to menopause share physical experiences of life as a woman","story":"Be it a first orgasm, experiences with contraception and menopause or something else, we would like to hear your storiesThe experience of life in a woman’s body can be challenging, embarrassing, funny and even joyful.Is there a physical experience you’ve had as a woman that has had a significant effect on your life – good or bad – and that you consider to be underreported?

However, according to sources, this was always unlikely because of the politics of rival Disney already having a similar long-lease deal in place at Pinewood, the home of the James Bond and Star Wars franchises.Disney has pulled all its content, which includes the Marvel superhero universe, the Star Wars films and Pixar’s Toy Story franchise, from Netflix in the US before the launch of its streaming service, Disney+ later this year.Details of the deal with Shepperton are unclear but it is likely that Netflix has struck at least a 10-year agreement, the same length of time Disney is thought to have at Pinewood.Earlier this year, Pinewood gained final planning permission for a £500m expansion of Shepperton, which will make it the second-largest studio in the world. The existing Shepperton site will be expanded five-fold and will include 16 new sound stages.Netflix indicated its frustrations at the constraints on UK studio space in a submission in support of Shepperton’s expansion last year, which said: “In 2018, Netflix plans to spend approximately $8bn on content worldwide, across more than 700 television and film productions. We would like to be able to produce more in the UK. However, we are limited by the lack of available space.”Netflix’s first original production at Shepperton will be The Old Guard, starring Charlize Theron, an action-drama based on the comic book series from Greg Rucka and Leandro Fernández.Last July, Netflix opened its first European production hub at a new 22,000 sq metre campus called Ciudad de la Tele (TV City) in Madrid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876ce9afc9d94544332f965c57b1197eb0506e50/0_173_5228_3138/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0effd5eeee9e639e71a6d70a8bcd8188","title":"readers glastonbury highlights","story":"From your favourite headliners to surprise delights, you’ve been sharing your top moments from a scorching weekendThe experience was like being taken into a vortex of sound and light with no way out as they transitioned seamlessly between haunting tracks on their most recent album (Free Yourself and Eve of Destruction were especially memorable) to classics like Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Galvanize.They flashed images of both old and new (robotic figures interspersed with black-and-white images) in a hypnotic way, with repetitive elements, so that the audience was truly engrossed and the atmosphere electric. The 3D imagery made you feel as if you were part of it. Light and dark moments in the music and the show took you through a waterfall of emotions, while the beat keept you in ecstasy. A truly unforgettable show, perhaps the best I have seen at Glastonbury. Satya, 26, GloucesterI was really nervous about going to Glastonbury because I’d never been to a festival before – I was there with my parents to celebrate my forthcoming 18th birthday. We waited at the Pyramid stage all day on Friday to see Stormzy, and saw some amazing performances from Bastille and George Ezra. We’re used to watching the headliners on TV so it was quite surreal!I’d decided I wanted to be near to the front for Stormzy but I never thought I’d be so close. His set was absolutely incredible, and all of his singers and dancers were amazing. The highlight of the night – and the whole festival – was when Chris Martin came on for Blinded By Your Grace. It was unforgettable, and I felt like I’d had a real “Glastonbury moment”. Seeing two such different musicians come together really showed me just how amazing the festival is. Megan, 17, LiverpoolAn old litter-picking volunteer with a white beard, dreadlocks and a Lancashire accent, who introduced himself only as “that guy”, did a short set at the open-mic in Strummerville on Saturday afternoon. He had a drum machine and a bass guitar, with which he played some remarkably funky tunes, before adding his own unexpectedly brilliant vocals, most notably in a song I assume was called Put It in the Bin Please, in which he pleaded with the audience in increasingly irate tones to correctly dispose of their rubbish. We’d only gone up there for a snooze in the shade of the trees but came away with a proper Glasto highlight. Russell Carswell, 32, LondonJeff Goldblum’s soundcheck! Warm fuzzy comedy from the king of smooth: guess the animal pattern pants, guess the animal sound, and then the surreal banter with the BBC journalist! When she asks, “When are you going to start?” Jeff casually replies, “Well, I think I already have” to an uproarious, loving crowd. Thanks for an amazing memory Jeff! Gary McKillion, 43, BarnstapleThe IICON stage was absolutely incredible. Obviously I loved the music, but I couldn’t believe how amazing the stage design was. It looked like something out of a dystopian future: proper way to listen to electronic music. Zach, 25, BristolThe Killers absolutely smashed it! We’ve seen them several times, including last year at TRNSMT, so I was initially a little underwhelmed when I saw the lineup … But it was their best performance by far, they put so much effort into it and it was flawless.Being our first Glasto with the kids we were fully prepared for meltdowns, but the children (Holly, eight, and Charlie, five) threw themselves into it and didn’t complain once, despite the heat and all the walking. Seeing them dancing their wee socks off at sunset to Liam Gallagher and the Killers made for such beautiful moments.The Kidzfield is a paradise, they got a photo with lovely Dynamo, who completely captured their imaginations! They spent hours doing arts and crafts, going potholing, playing in forts, and getting decorated with rainbows and glitter. They were really on board with the green focus at this year’s festival, even though they are very young, they recognise the importance. Edwina McNulty, GlasgowSeeing Michael Eavis singing Elvis songs on the Avalon Cafe stage was probably the sweetest moment of Glastonbury. In a relatively intimate setting was the man who made this all happen, singing his heart out at the age of 83 and clearly loving every minute of it. It only got better when Emily joined him for a duet of Something Stupid. Neither have particularly brilliant voices but the music world owes them everything. An utterly charming moment. Simon Donohue, 47, ManchesterThe Acoustic Brass Off on the Truth Stage on Thursday night was an absolute blast, with lots of catchy covers and a great atmosphere. Dat Brass began on stage, belting out Cry Me a River and several other tunes. They then waded into the crowd, where they joined forces with the New York Brass Band for some more fun, playing Thrift Shop and Get Lucky. Double sousaphone equals double fun! Matt, 29, LondonFrank Turner on the Avalon Stage on Friday night. I’d not seen him live before but the energy and desire to put on a great show were incredible. Jonny Ford, 50, LiverpoolThis is about my 25th Glastonbury and the highlight this year was wandering around with my 13-year-old daughter, Cliodhna, on Sunday night. We went to the top of the Ribbon Tower in the Park, which I’d never done before. It’s just fantastic. The whole of gorgeous Glastonbury is laid out before you, a million lights twinkling. All three of my kids have been coming since they were little. We all love it and I hope we’re all there next year at the 50th Glastonbury, as I’ll be 50 too. Jane O’Hara, 49, CharlseworthMy friends and I agonised over whether to see her or the Cure. Halfway through the first song I knew we’d made the right choice. She is the Glasto performer that 2019 deserves: singing and talking about being an outsider, acceptance, joy, sexuality, confusion. She dazzled with on-point choreography, confidence and pitchperfect delivery. It was theatre, dance and music – a real show, a triumph. It helps that she’s very funny, exudes warmth and can build a rapid rapport with the crowd with her slightly off-kilter English. It was a shame so comparatively few people were there to see it. But it gave the show an intimate feel and even a little space to dance. Andy McGrath, 30, StreathamIt was the first time I’ve seen the Cure live – WOW! An amazing performance from a band who showed you really don’t need the bunting and the special guests, just a huge catalogue of amazing songs performed brilliantly by superb musicians and a singer with Robert Smith’s ability to mesmerise. solarevolutionWatching Jorja Smith with my 14-year-old daughter, her eyes filled with happy tears as she looked across at me and mouthed: “This is the happiest I’ve ever been.” In front of us were five 21-year-olds from south Wales at their first Glastonbury. They too were teary, hugging us and telling us how much they wanted to bring their daughters to Glastonbury when they were older, saying how wonderful it was to make such special memories. I’d stewarded that day between 3am and 10am and was knackered! But as the sun (finally) began to dip beneath the horizon the world stopped just for a moment and it was the most beautiful place in the world.

It happens only rarely in any given spot across the globe.The best views this time were from Chile’s sprawling Atacama desert north of the coastal city of La Serena, where a lack of humidity and city lights combine to create the world’s clearest skies.The region had not seen an eclipse since 1592, according to the Chilean Astronomy Society. The next one is expected in 2165.La Serena, a city of some 200,000 people, saw the arrival of more than 300,000 visitors, forcing the local water company to increase output and service gas stations to store extra fuel. Police and health services were also reinforced.Office workers poured from buildings late in the afternoon to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon and a run on special “eclipse-viewing” glasses downtown had led to a shortage in many stores, with street vendors charging as much as $10 for a pair of the disposable, cardboard-framed lenses.Northern Chile is known for clear skies and some of the largest, most powerful telescopes on Earth are being built in the area, turning the South American country into a global astronomy hub.“In the past 50 years we’ve only had two eclipses going over observatories. So when it happens and an observatory lies in the path of a totality, it really is special for us,” said Elyar Sedaghati, an astronomer working as a fellow at the European Southern Observatory in Paranal, Chile.“We can finally use our toys during the day because it’s always at night that we use them.”The town of La Higuera was also plunged into total darkness.Town officials distributed more than 2,000 cardboard-frame protective eyeglasses at local schools and community centres while workers built statues of huge sunglasses and a darkened sun on a local square.The total eclipse could also be seen in the Argentine town of Chascomús, where dozens braved near-freezing temperatures and strong winds and claimed a spot at a pier in a lagoon, hoping to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.“I’ve been looking at the sky since my youth. My first telescope when I was a kid was made out of cardboard,” said Ricardo Rumie, a 68-year-old veteran eclipse-watcher, who set up his camera with a tripod and a telescope with a sun filter along the banks of the lagoon.“I’ve seen other eclipses but never like this one. I just couldn’t miss it. For me it’s something supreme.”“This is something that they say won’t repeat itself for like 300 years, so we wanted to bring our son,” said Maximiliano Giannobile, who arrived at the pier with 18-month-old Vitto wrapped in a puffy jacket and several layers of clothes.The Earth’s next total solar eclipse will be 14 December, 2020, and it also will cross Chile and Argentina, though on a different path."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b38f6f6ef38dae44012e0f831a6005d3e32757/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bacd8210472387c0084c6df1a4bd1318 720w","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

He got Morgan for a golden duck on this ground in 2015, caught on the boundary I think. There’s no such intent from Morgan this time, at least not yet, but he does get a sweep away for four to turn a decent over into a good on for England.“I do wish the score predictor would do one,” says Ian Copestake. It’s like telling Fate what the future is going to be and then acting surprised when your trousers are pulled down around your ankles.”Wait till you see our Copestake Email Predictor at work.39th over: England 232-4 (Morgan 16, Stokes 5) Three singles from Neesham’s over. Stokes, in particular, is struggling to time the ball andor pierce the field. Morgan said that Roy and Bairstow made the pitch look better than it was on Sunday perhaps the same is true here.38th over: England 229-4 (Morgan 14, Stokes 4) Southee beats Stokes with consecutive deliveries outside off stump. England are struggling here, as they did at a similar stage of the innings against India. They’ll do well to make 350 now. I think I just heard the first strains of the Jaws theme. “Oh dear Rob,” says John Withington. “Just as I was about to type about Morgan’s generally negative impact on this batting team, Buttler chips one up to mid-off. I’m trying not to make Morgan responsible for everything but it’s seemed to me for a long time that he has the vampiric ability to suck the life out of an England innings. Routinely coming in and blocking most of his first dozen or so balls he seems singularly unsuited to bat high up in this high tempo batting order. Did the malaise of the previous over lead to Buttler pushing his hands impatiently at that one? Who knows. But with occasional dramatic exceptions I think Morgan has no place in the top six of a team batting so fluently. I said it in each of the previous few games and it feels like it’s the same here. Even in the India win his impact was marked and nearly cost England dear.”Well, I don’t agree with that. I’d argue he’s worth his place as captain alone, even if he wasn’t averaging 70 with a strike rate of 108 in the last year. My feeling is that when Morgan looks bad, he looks very, very bad, which clouds judgement of how good he is.37th over: England 226-4 (Morgan 12, Stokes 3) Boult, who has two overs remaining, is replaced by Neesham. He bowls a maiden to Stokes - yet it should have brought the wicket of Morgan. He was sent back by Stokes, but Santner’s close-range throw missed the stumps. Sheesh, that was close. This is getting very hairy.“The difference between England’s openers, if they succeed, and the rest, is striking, and means they won’t be beaten if those two give them decent starts, especially with Stokes in such good form and Buttler to come after him,” says Andrew Hurley. “It’s interesting to see the discussion of Root’s strike rate, but isn’t it a non-issue when you think of the strike-rate of NZ’s top 3, Rahul, Australia’s two 3s (Khawaja and Smith are two 3s squeezed into 3 and 4).”Yes, it’s only really a problem – and even then just a small one - if he comes in at a hundred and plenty for one.36th over: England 226-4 (Morgan 12, Stokes 3) On further reflection, it was a brilliant delivery from Boult to Buttler, a kind of knuckle ball that kicked from a length to induce the error. Southee comes on to replace Henry and is hit for consecutive boundaries by Morgan. The first was an unconvincing, gloved pull the second was a emphatic back cut.“Jason Roy appeared to limp off with a badly bruised hand on. the completion of his innings,” says John Jones. “Do you think he will be able to field later Rob?”Don’t be fatuous, John. You know full well he won’t be able field because of his badly bruised everything.35th over: England 218-4 (Morgan 4, Stokes 3) I assumed it was a slower ball from Boult, simply because Buttler mistimed it so badly, but I’m not sure it was. England are one wicket away from being in a bit of trouble.“Wotcha Rob,” says Mac Millings. “I can’t remember my first nosebleed, but I do remember my first time on stage. I was 11 years old. Our English teacher had written a play, the plot of which involved a bunch of people stranded on a desert island. He had, wisely, given me a part with only one line, but even that proved too much. We performed in front of the whole school. My heart was beating out of my chest. I was to stand at the front of the stage, point into the distance, and say, ‘Look at that boat!’ Everything’s going to be fine, everything’s going to be fine, everything’s going to be fine, I told myself. And then I stood at the front of the stage, in front of the whole bloody school, pointed off into the distance, and said, ‘Look at that finger!’”Boult has taken the big wicket! Buttler drove a slower ball towards mid-off, where Williamson moved to the right to take a smart catch. That is a huge moment, and reward for Williamson’s aggressive captaincy.34th over: England 214-3 (Buttler 11, Morgan 3) New Zealand are hunting another wickets, with their strike bowlers Henry and Boult in the attack. It means that, if England get through this spell, they will have a chance to really punish the change bowlers and the hitherto rusty Southee. Three singles from Henry’s over he has two more, Boult has three.“Given the odd nature of Root’s dismissal, I’m wondering how the umpire gave him out,” says Matt Emerson. “Normally for a catch behind it’s on sound or an obvious deflection. Seeing as Root didn’t even feel that he hit it, I’m presuming he didn’t hear a nick either. So that means that the umpire has better hearing even though he’s 22 yards away (not impossible as Root has a helmet on and the fielders went up), or he guessed...”I guess he was distracted by the whirl of his own arms and legs.33rd over: England 211-3 (Buttler 9, Morgan 2) Morgan crunches a Boult yorker down the ground for a single to get off the mark. Later in the over he pulls a single. It’s the hook, rather than the pull, that has been a problem in the last week or so. Boult is surely setting him up for the higher bouncer at some stage.“My first nosebleed followed my being headbutted by my brother,” says Ian Copestake. “Not as painful, though, as being told to boost my accas.”32nd over: England 206-3 (Buttler 6, Morgan 0) The new batsman is Eoin Morgan, who is unsurprisingly greeted with a short ball from Henry. He sways out of the way.“My first nosebleed was in the opening minutes of my first O level exam,” says Kev. “Leaning forward to read the first question on the paper, I found the text obscured by my own freshly spilt blood. I immediately raised my hand in the manner instructed, inviting the invigilator’s response, ‘What is it now boy?’ stage whispered through gritted teeth. Ah, schooldays...”I assume there wasn’t much sympathy. In those days, there was only a 5050 chance you’d be excused from an exam with two broken hands.For the second match in a row, Bairstow falls soon after reaching his century. He launched into a big drive at Henry and dragged the ball back onto the stumps. The first person to shake his hand was Kane Williamson, class act that he is, and Bairstow strolled off to a fine ovation for a superb innings: 106 from 99 balls with 15 fours and a six.31st over: England 200-2 (Bairstow 100, Buttler 6) Jos Buttler has been promoted to No4, a good move that should allow him a bit of time to get his eye in. That’s what he does - for two balls, and then he drives his third sweetly for four. That’s drinks.“Hi Rob!” says Kanishk Srinivasan. “As a kid, I had some terrible instances of nosebleeds. It was always a problem when the days were too hot, which was always the case in Calcutta. And for some reason, cricket practice sessions were the best of times for my nose to start bleeding. It came to a point where my parents were surprised when my whites weren’t red from blood after cricket, so they made me start packing one or two extra T-shirts, knowing that I’d need them. Thankfully, my nose finally decided to stop bleeding one day, so I haven’t had to deal with too many instances since I was a kid.”Root tried to hook the first ball of a new spell from Trent Boult, and Latham took the catch down the leg side. Root reviewed almost instantly – but there was a small spike on Ultra-Edge, so the original decision stands. It was such a faint touch that Root didn’t feel it, and he shakes his head as he leaves the field. He takes England’s only review with him.Root seems pretty confident he didn’t hit this.30th over: England 194-1 (Bairstow 100, Root 24) Jonny Bairstow has had quite a week. He hits Southee for two boundaries behind square on the leg side to become the first England player ever to make consecutive World Cup hundreds. It’s also his third in a row against New Zealand, and it’s been an innings of such authority: 95 balls, 14 fours and one six.“Do you suppose that Root’s struggles with fast run-making is because the other sides have worked him out, and bowledset fields accordingly?” says John Starbuck. “All teams have had a good chance to analyse the opposition in this tournament so slow scorers will be accommodated accordingly. The better batsmen will adjust in response, while the best batsmen will go their own sweet ways because that’s what they do.”I think it’s just that he’s not a power hitter. He’s had that problem since he a kid. The reason his defensive technique is so sound is that when he was younger he could barely hit it off the square. He knew that to make runs he would have to bat a long time, and worked on his defensive game accordingly. 29th over: England 186-1 (Bairstow 92, Root 24) Root back cuts Neesham for a single, and thus becomes the first England batsman ever to score 500 runs in a single World Cup. The overall record - Sachin Tendulkar’s 673 in 2003 - will probably be broken by somebody in the next 10 days.“How good is this Kiwi batting line-up?” asks Matt Turland, interrogatively rather than rhetorically. “Like you said, no-one has really hit form so far but I’m worried that it’s all going to click. Guptill to score a rapid 70-80 before Williamson comes in with Taylor to smite the ball to all corners of the field.”Guptill is dangerous, because a) he’s due and b) he can go huge. England will want at least 350. If they get a monstrous score, New Zealand might decide to protect their net run rate. But I doubt that will happen, certainly not at the start of the innings.28th over: England 182-1 (Bairstow 90, Root 22) Well, there’s a bit of thwacking. Bairstow blasts Southee back over his head for the first six of the match.“11.7 million people watched the England women’s football last night,” says Tom Carver. “I offer that as a statement of fact, not as a rebuke to the ECB.”I suspect they would argue that there wouldn’t be much women’s cricket without the money from Sky.27th over: England 173-1 (Bairstow 83, Root 20) I suspect Jos Buttler will come in at the fall of the next wicket, unless it’s in the next couple of overs. A quick single brings up a good fifty partnership, which has been built on running rather than thwacking. There have been only four boundaries since Roy was dismissed.“Cheers from USA Rob!” says John Bonn. “I grew up playing and following baseball but somehow, in my sixties, I started following the travails of English cricket through your coverage. I’m convinced I have the “cricket mentality” although I can only behold it from afar. Give ‘em hell England!”Wasn’t it EW Swanton who coined that last phrase?Nosebleed stops play There’s an extended break in play while Joe Root receives treatment for what looks like a nosebleed. He’s okay to continue. You never forget your firs nosebleed, do you? Mine was on the first morning of this Test, and I would love to know why I remember something quite so pointless. 26th over: England 168-1 (Bairstow 80, Root 19) Root is dropped by Latham off Santner, although it was a tough chance from a pretty big deflection. Bairstow also has an escape later in the over, flashing at a ball that keeps a bit low and skids just past off stump. That was a really good over from Santner - yet England still scampered seven from it.“After a 38-hour trip from Cornwall to Brisbane, I’m currently fighting off the urge to go to sleep, but I’m not going to be able to make it through all of this innings,” says Andrew Jolly. “Hoping I wake up to England being in the semis and at least one or two all-nighters to come. It is of course the hope that gets you.”That and the 38-hour trips. 25th over: England 161-1 (Bairstow 76, Root 16) Bairstow drives Neesham not far short of Henry at mid-on, and then Root steals a second to long leg. He is still going along at a run a ball.“This is a cracking start, again, but it makes me wonder which is the ‘real’ England team?” says Guy Hornsby. “On a good pitch we can really be aggressive, especially batting first, and we’ve shown against India how dangerous that makes us. But on slower, sticky pitches we struggle. So has this team been here all along? And are we finally coming to terms with the stifling pressure cooker tournament cricket? And can I have a gin before 12:30?”Batting first is so important, I think. It’s interesting that two of the fundamentals of England’s ODI reinvention – batting second and playing two spinners – have gone out the window during this tournament. Who says they’re not adaptable? 24th over: England 156-1 (Bairstow 74, Root 13) A short ball from Santner is dumped over midwicket for four by Bairstow. His ODI career was reborn against New Zealand on this ground in 2015, when he was called up as a late replacement and scored a series-winning 83 not out. In fact he has quite a record against New Zealand, with an average of 92 and a strike rate of 118.Meanwhile, Root gets his first boundary with a jaunty reverse ramp.23rd over: England 145-1 (Bairstow 69, Root 7) Root plays a classical back-foot drive through extra cover for three. He has seven from eight balls. The size of this ground should allow him to be busy between the wickets, which is important because at times in this tournament he has struggled to up the rate when England have batted first. 22nd over: England 141-1 (Bairstow 68, Root 4) Santner replaces Southee. Bairstow hacks him behind square for four, the highlight of the over. England are going at 6.41 per over, and Bairstow needs 32 more to become the first England batsman to make back-to-back World Cup hundreds. I offer that as a statement of fact, not a tempter of fate.21st over: England 133-1 (Bairstow 63, Root 3) “With most of my family living abroad, me and my dad meet up with my uncle and cousin every summer for a day at the internationals,” says Damian Burns. “We usually start at around 6am, setting off by train to some far flung corner of Britain from our base on the South Coast, with a large bag full of cans to ready us for a day spent drunkenly cheering England on (or heckling, depending on the mood – I once asked Joe Root on the square leg boundary at Edgbaston whether he voted in or out on the day of the Brexit result). We usually arrive back South so sozzled after a 15-hour session mum has to peel us off the front step because we’ve lost the ability to operate a set of keys. I know that’s not necessarily how the ECB want things but it’s tradition, right?”It’s what this great empire was built on.20th over: England 133-1 (Bairstow 62, Root 2) Bairstow and Root remind everyone of how well they run together by stealing a second run on the leg side. No running is required from the next delivery, a contemptuous smack through midwicket by Bairstow off Southee.19th over: England 124-1 (Bairstow 54, Root 1) “I moved to NZ in 2014,” says Alex Webster. “Since then I’ve seen England dumped out of the group stages at three different World Cups, including being in the stadium with my (extremely drunk) cricket team when we got pumped in Wellington. I’m now sat at the bottom of the South Island, withstanding a Fiordland winter, mentally high fiving every well run two with a bristling intensity. I NEED this!”Roy has gone! After pulling consecutive boundaries off Neesham, he check-drove the next ball straight to Santner at short extra cover. It was a loose stroke and Roy was angry with himself as he walks off he knows he is leaving a few runs out there. But his swaggering 61-ball 60 has given England a great start.18th over: England 115-0 (Roy 52, Bairstow 54) Tim Southee replaces Santner. He bowled a poor first spell (2-0-23-0), although in his defence it’s his first game of the tournament so he cannot be without rust. His first over back is a low-key affair four singles from it.17th over: England 111-0 (Roy 50, Bairstow 52) Roy wins the race to a half-century, working the new bowler Jimmy Neesham for a single. That’s the seventh time in the last eight innings that he has reached fifty. Bairstow joins him later in the over with a work off the pads for two. He’s played particularly well this morning: 46 balls, nine fours. That’s drinks.16th over: England 107-0 (Roy 49, Bairstow 49) A quite over from Santner three singles from it. Roy and Bairstow are yet to hit a six - there are no short boundaries today - but they have hit 15 fours between them.15th over: England 104-0 (Roy 47, Bairstow 48) The medium-pacer Colin de Grandhomme comes into the attack, or rather the defence. His first over goes for 11. Bairstow steers the second ball to third man for four, a single for Roy brings up another rapid hundred partnership and then Bairstow repeats his earlier boundary. It’s worth dusting off an old stat: of the 124 openers who have scored 1000 runs in ODIs. Bairstow and Roy have the highest strike rate.Meanwhile, here’s my colleague Daniel Harris “Is de Grandhomme the greatest Colin since…” 14th over: England 93-0 (Roy 45, Bairstow 39) Roy makes room to crash Santner through extra cover for four, a quite brutal shot. Seven from the over, which makes it 25 from the last three after that slightly quiet spell.“I feel sick even though I’m not watching the game on TV here in Slovenia yet,” says Karen. “I have to rely on husband Spike to do all the necessary technical stuff \u0026amp he doesn’t feel the urgency like me! I adore cricket, my Dad was a huge fan \u0026amp I used to think it was soooo boring, but since Flintoff I’ve been hooked.”13th over: England 86-0 (Roy 39, Bairstow 38) That’s the shot of the morning from Bairstow, a glorious drive for four that goes between the legs of Roy at the non-striker’s end. It’s been another excellent start for England on what looks like a belter.“In response to Simon McMahon (over 9), we were at London St Pancras station on Sat morning at 7.30am on our way to watch the MLB at the London Stadium,” says Andy Beardsley. “We were on coffee but there was a chap sat behind us who ordered two pints for himself for breakfast. I assume he had a good day!” You should have come and said hello."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51f09ae0f56819815d686739dec01c149b0d4613/437_774_7149_4290/master/7149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d388211c60fe258db6535955a8b80982","title":"katherine ryan interview comedy single mum glitter room","story":"The queen of the caustic punchline talks about plastic surgery, embarrassing her daughter – and turning her life as a single mum into a sitcomKatherine Ryan is busily scrolling through a neighbourhood Facebook group when we meet. “Someone’s dog attacked another dog today which was sad,” she says, “but mostly people are just selling things.” However, her days in north London, might be numbered. “I’m just ready to be a bit country,,” she explains. Back in 2007, when she arrived in the UK, Ryan headed straight for Crouch End, where a gaggle of fellow Canadian comics had already settled down, and where she now spends her days mooching around in a velour Juicy Couture tracksuit she bought when Paris Hilton was at her peak.But the 35-year-old is now ready for a change. Her itchy feet are particularly understandable when you consider just how much has happened in the last 12 years. Previously a staff trainer for the Hooters restaurant chain in Canada, Ryan arrived in London with her then boyfriend, didn’t think she’d stay long and flitted between London and her tiny home town of Sarnia, Ontario. Her comedy career was in its infancy (“I was definitely doing an impression of Sarah Silverman”) but watching the likes of Sara Pascoe made her fall for London’s standup scene, and put down roots in the city. She worked a 9 to 5 job, had a daughter, Violet – who is now 10 – and became a single mum when her relationship with Violet’s father ended. “I didn’t even have a phone when she was born. A poor mum is a good mum,” she deadpans.However, Ryan was also slowly ascending from open mic nights to panel shows such as 8 Out of 10 Cats and on to her current position as Gen Y’s answer to Joan Rivers. She’s best known for caustic punchlines verging on the unsayable, and gigs on programmes like (the fairly mean-spirited) Your Face Or Mine?, where couples have to decide whether they’re more attractive than one other. In a meta twist, she also presented the UK reboot of Rivers’ gilded doc series How’d You Get So Rich? Ryan once quipped that the late comic “got exactly what she wanted from that final surgery – to stop ageing”.We are snatching an hour at the Ace hotel in London amid Ryan’s busy schedule, ostensibly to talk about her new Netflix special, Glitter Room, but Ryan is soon giving her opinion about everything from Cardi B (“She’s just like, yeah I was a stripper – I love the fact that she’s so open”) to her tiny, “unethical” teacup dogs. She’s got an animal rights event lined up straight after, and is a big fan of the kind of canines her mate Danny Dyer describes as “dogs that shiver and piss from their eyes”.Ryan is warm, lightly cynical, and a bit of a magpie – she marvels at our waitress’s luminescent makeup, and is herself dressed in a diamanté-studded denim jacket and black tutu with big, Lady Gaga-esque sunglasses by her side. She is unusually interested in the harried freelancers hunched over their laptops in the hotel lobby, a situation she can relate to as well as the Netflix special – her second, following 2017’s In Trouble – she’s currently writing a sitcom for the streaming service. The Duchess, a “heightened version” of her life, will, she says, offer something a bit different from the sadcoms that have dominated TV in recent years. “My character is a bit of a fish out of water – she’s this brash, disruptive, North American mother who doesn’t act like you would think a mother would act. And she’s happy about being a mum! I don’t feel like it’s a drag. I think you can still be taken seriously, you can still be fashionable, you can still have fun,” she says, before pausing. “Do you think we should sadden it up a bit?”However, even if the tears are few, there’s a realism that’s never far from the surface with Ryan’s work. In both her sitcom and Glitter Room – previously seen on tour and in the West End – her hyperbolic, cutting gags often centre on motherhood, and single motherhood in particular. “The Glitter Room is Violet’s bedroom,” Ryan explains. The show is “about how proud I felt when I bought us our first property ever, a tiny flat. We decorated it to be really feminine, yet still in 2018 builders would notice that I was alone and be like, ‘That’s so sad, where’s the man?’ Or ‘You don’t want all those flowers – no man will want to live here.’”In her own experience, there’s still a sense of judgment around single motherhood, even within showbusiness, where she says she’s constantly asked, “Who’s watching your daughter?”, or “How have you explained your dirty mouth to her?”“Single dads are like sexy heroes,” she says, a subject she expands on live. “But if you’re a single mum there’s still a stigma.”The special was filmed in LA, where Ryan is less known than in the UK. “It really felt like proving myself, like you would do at an open mic or a comedy club,” she says. “But I think that’s always the way it should be. I’ve seen shows where you can tell people have been laughing at a comedian’s jokes for a while and they shouldn’t have been. I think you always want to be able to show up and be treated really fairly – ruthlessly even – by an audience and that’s the only way you’re going to know if you’re really funny or not”.Ryan compares having been a single mum to being in the Brie Larson hostage film Room, “except at least in the film the mum had someone bringing her groceries”. While she and Violet are supremely close, Ryan is also careful to give her daughter as much privacy as possible, and refrains from posting pictures of her online.Meanwhile, the possibility of moving home isn’t the only change in Ryan’s life right now. While filming the upcoming series of Who Do You Think You Are? back in Canada (“I was just like, please do not let my ancestors have slaughtered the indigenous population, please!”), she ran into her high school sweetheart, Bobby, whom she hadn’t seen in 20 years. “I genuinely have always loved him, always,” she says. “I don’t know if that’s the nostalgia of your first love and being 16, but he walked in and I was like, wow. Then I just slept with him for an anecdote. I thought, he’ll go back to his friends and tell them and have a laugh, I’ll tell my friends, they’ll have a laugh, but no, I just really liked him.” She pauses, before adding a pained “Uh oh!”Bobby’s still in Canada so they’re taking things slowly. However, Ryan feels conflicted about the whole thing given her current projects. “It’s annoying because I have the special coming out where I’m going, right I’m not going to have a boyfriend again until I’m in my 60s. I also don’t want to abandon people. I’ve spent all this time talking to women who feel there is this culture that’s like, ‘She has all these cats and she says she doesn’t want a boyfriend but she’s lying, she’s incomplete.’ I hate that, because I felt very happy and very complete.”In any case, she isn’t about to start extolling the virtues of being coupled up. “Men are like dolphins – best enjoyed on holiday,” she quips in Glitter Room, and she’s still keeping Bobby “under review” she says. “I’m like, whatever happens, I don’t want to be in love, I don’t want to be in a relationship and I don’t want to get married.” Then she bursts out laughing and flashes a sardonic smile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4e69d5b5915fac6f3a8af23695b7294d7199e7/1110_953_4164_2498/master/4164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c8f0d67554ab1fbd6cc251b334b5b60","title":"the strange undoing of prudencia hart review new vic theatre","story":"New Vic, Newcastle-under-LymeThis dizzylingly funny drama boasts a tremendous cast, witty costumes and surprising set‘This is not a ballad,” says Prudencia Hart early on in David Greig’s dizzyingly funny play. The driving snow, the midwinter setting and the relentless rhyming scheme suggest otherwise. The more this academic protests, the more she becomes an embodiment of the very subject she is studying. Fresh from the Edinburgh school of Scottish studies, she leaves a conference on border ballads to discover the passions, lusts and loves that her bookish temperament has previously denied. In a long dark night of the soul, the ballad goes from the bookshelf to lived experience.When Wils Wilson staged the play for the National Theatre of Scotland, it was performed in pubs of the kind in which it is set, the action taking place around the audience’s tables. Here, in Anna Marsland’s boisterous production, the New Vic’s in-the-round stage creates something of the same effect. From the pre-show ceilidh to the spirited direct address, we’re made to feel the Kelso pub is all around us.EM Parry’s witty costume design tells a story in itself Suni La’s prim Prudencia in her purple felt hat and sensible jumper keeps her distance from tweedy scholars with wayward Open University haircuts before things turn ghoulish and four corbies appear in devilish red tops and black eyeliner. With a library of books cascading overhead and the bowels of hell lurking below, Parry’s set keeps on surprising.The play feels on the long side for a comedy, but by giving proper weight to the serious story of Prudencia’s run-in with David Fairs’ devil (both suave and irritable, and seeming to dislike hell more than she does), Marsland draws us deep into its darker corners.Where La is as earnest and long-suffering as every fairytale heroine should be, Matthew McVarish brings a note of lovable enthusiasm to her otherwise boorish academic rival Colin Syme they might be opposites in the head-versus-heart debate, but they make you believe opposites can attract. There is tremendous work from Alice Blundell and Eleanor House, jumping energetically between supporting characters and sweet renditions of folk songs, turning a dark winter’s tale into an airy summer comedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4719f6e3cf93e11d30359f8fd145d2d8c79e89/0_209_3266_1960/master/3266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3d4c165ef4e0798a7ead8dfbf8113a2","title":"fca proposes ban on cryptocurrency products","story":"Financial Conduct Authority says crypto-assets are ill-suited to small investors and very volatileThe UK’s markets regulator has proposed a ban on financial instruments linked to digital cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, warning that such products could cause huge losses for retail consumers unlikely to understand their risks or value.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said products such as derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that reference crypto-assets were “ill-suited” to small investors.It cited their “extreme volatility”, the difficulty in valuing them, consumers’ patchy understanding of what they were buying and the increased risk of financial crime.Investors might “suffer harm from sudden and unexpected losses if they invest in these products”, the FCA said, estimating that a ban would benefit consumers to the tune of between £75m and £234.3m a year.Cryptocurrencies are an alternative way of making payments to cash or credit cards. The technology behind it allows the ‘money’ to be sent directly to others without it having to pass through the banking system. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs – and transactions can be made in a way that keeps you reasonably pseudonymous.If you own a crypto-asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours. If you spend it, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it, and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the blockchain.Bitcoin was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, surging in value as investors piled in, drawing comparisons with the tulipmania of the 17th century before it crashed. Sceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto-assets ideal for criminals and terrorists.\u0026nbspThe number of crypto-assets has grown rapidly, including from several major companies. JP Morgan has built its own cryptocurrencies, while trading in traditional financial assets that track the value of cryptocurrencies – such as derivatives and contracts for difference – has also become available. Facebook is planning to launch its own digital currency – Libra – in 2020.The proposed ban would affect complex financial products such as contracts for difference (CFDs), options and futures, as well as exchange traded notes.Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: “As with our work on the wider CFD and binary options markets, we will act when we see poor products being sold to retail consumers. These are complex contracts built on top of complex assets.“Most consumers cannot reliably value derivatives based on unregulated crypto-assets. Prices are extremely volatile and as we have seen globally, financial crime in crypto-asset markets can lead to sudden and unexpected losses.“It is therefore clear to us that these derivatives and exchange traded notes are unsuitable investments for retail consumers.”Woolard has previously warned Facebook that its plans for a new cryptocurrency called Libra, due to be launched next year, will warrant intense scrutiny from regulators.One of Facebook’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, said this month that Libra could allow corporations involved in the scheme to wield power over nation states.One of the FCA’s concerns is the volatility in the price of digital currencies, with fluctuations in the value of bitcoin proving a prime example.Bitcoin had languished below $6,000 for months but was galvanised by Facebook’s Libra plans.It has a history of wild swings and some analysts say it could rise back to $20,000 again – or fall as low as $3,000. In late 2017 it nearly reached $20,000 before a spectacular collapse in 2018.Its instability is among the factors that have dampened expectations about its ability to disrupt the global financial system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69b3834ef6b21a595590639a8a45d4f4b2332312/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdbd4378f85cf616fba8419384c2473d","title":"libra us congress asks facebook pause development cryptocurrency","story":"Legislators say they need time to investigate cryptocurrency and its potential impactThe US Congress has asked Facebook to pause development on its Libra cryptocurrency until lawmakers have had more time to investigate the ramifications of the company’s actions.In a letter from the Democratic heads of the house committee on financial services and its subcommittees, the legislators ask the company to “immediately cease implementation plans”.“Because Facebook is already in the hands of over a quarter of the world’s population, it is imperative that Facebook and its partners immediately cease implementation plans until regulators and Congress have an opportunity to examine these issues and take action,” the letter says.“During this moratorium, we intend to hold public hearings on the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency-based activities and explore legislative solutions. Failure to cease implementation before we can do so risks a new Swiss-based financial system that is too big to fail.”Facebook says Libra is a \u0027global currency and financial infrastructure\u0027 - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the £ symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the \u0027Libra Association\u0027. It functions as what is known as a \u0027stablecoin\u0027, pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(£8m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen the cryptocurrency launches, users can download Calibra, a digital wallet, that will allow them to send it to anyone with a smartphone. It will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app.It is not clear which countries the coin will launch in first, though Facebook said \u0027almost anybody\u0027 in the world with a smartphone will be able to download the app.Although Facebook has spearheaded the development of Libra, and will be creating the first consumer “wallet” for the currency through its Calibra subsidiary, the actual development of the service will be handed over to the Libra Association, an arms-length organisation headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.The association is run nominally by a consortium of Libra’s initial backers, including Visa, Lyft, Vodafone and Coinbase, of which Facebook is just one partner among many. But in practice, the social network retains a significant amount of control, even paying the salaries of the body’s “roughly half-dozen employees”, according to the industry news site the Information.The duration of the moratorium on development need not be that long: the congressional committee is convening a full hearing examining Libra on 17 July.But the letter, which was delivered to Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Libra’s chief executive, David Marcus, suggests the company is in for a bumpy ride when the hearing takes place.“The scant information provided about the intent, roles, potential use, and security of the Libra and Calibra exposes the massive scale of the risks and the lack of clear regulatory protections,” it says. “If products and services like these are left improperly regulated and without sufficient oversight, they could pose systemic risks that endanger US and global financial stability.“These risks are even more glaring in light of Facebook’s troubled past, where it did not always keep its users’ information safe. For example, Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm hired by the 2016 Trump campaign, had access to more than 50 million Facebook users’ private data which it used to influence voting behaviour.”Maxine Waters, the chair of the house committee on financial services, has been one of the leading congressional Democrats calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump. “Ninety per cent of the calls and mail I’m receiving in my office support impeachment of Trump and so do I,” she wrote in April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e4e48b08863bd7fec2dd12077953373632ec86/0_0_5061_3038/master/5061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797c5b1577fb4ed9f477885c2f9433bb","title":"straight pride organizers suspicious envelopes glitter","story":"Anonymous envelopes sent to members of ‘Super Happy Fun America’ who believe straight people are an ‘oppressed majority’Organizers of Boston’s so-called “Straight Pride” march have revealed that threatening envelopes posted to them and which prompted them to call law enforcement turned out to be full of nothing more hazardous than glitter.The suspicious envelopes, filled with a “granular substance”, were addressed to three members of “Super Happy Fun America”, a group whose membership have previously organized and attended events, some of which have turned violent and who have links to far-right figures.In 2018, Think Progress reported that Resist Marxism had links with white nationalist groups, and that members had expressed antisemitic sentiments in leaked chats.The sender or senders of the glitter parcels remains unknown. The envelopes were sent without return addresses, and the contents confirmed as glitter by law enforcement, Sahady told CNN.Anti-LGBT conservatives such as Newt Gringrich, Senator Mitt Romney Republican of Utah, and Michele Bachmann have found themselves glitter-bombed over the years and is considered a popular form of protest from LGBTQ advocates.Samson Racioppi, Super Happy Fun America’s interim treasurer, told Talking Points Memo his letter led to a “big scene” after he called 911.According to TPM, Super Happy Fun America members insist that they’re expressing their “sincerely held belief” that straight people are an “oppressed majority”.But others critics have criticized the march, which is scheduled for August, as a homophobic event that aims to troll the LGBTQ community.SHFA’s treasurer Racioppi said he didn’t find out the envelopes contained glitter until he read about it in the news.“My neighbors are now probably pretty irritated with me,” he said while describing himself and his glittered associates as “victims”.Racioppi lamented the “violence” they received at the hands of the anonymous glitter-sender.“I wouldn’t wish this for anyone,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/851dc2e890522b19b7325caa16615e202a62ab04/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=fe083bc9bd0a3376c1b19ec623eb2f58","title":"nicki minaj to headline music festival in saudi arabia","story":"Saudi government accused of hypocrisy for requiring women to wear full-length robeNicki Minaj will perform in Saudi Arabia, it was announced on Wednesday as the ultraconservative kingdom sheds decades of restrictions on entertainment.The female rapper is known for her outlandish, provocative style and hits like “Anaconda”, where she raps about her “big fat” backside. Her lyrics are often laced with profanities and her skin-bearing music videos often include twerking. Christian groups criticised her 2012 Grammy awards performance, which included dancing priests and an exorcism.Saudi organisers announced she would be the headline act at the Jeddah World Fest on 18 July. The concert, which in line with Saudi laws is alcohol and drug-free, is open to people 16 and older and will take place at the King Abdullah Sports stadium in the Red Sea city.Reactions on social media ranged from shock and joy to criticism and disappointment. In a profanity-laced video posted on Twitter and viewed more than 37,000 times, a Saudi woman wearing a loose headscarf accused the Saudi government of hypocrisy for inviting Minaj to perform but requiring women who attend the concert to wear the modest full-length robe known as the abaya. Most Saudi women also veil their hair and faces.“She’s going to go and shake her ass and all her songs are indecent and about sex and shaking ass and then you tell me to wear the abaya,” the Saudi woman says. “What the hell?”Saudi organisers said the concert will be broadcast globally and covered by MTV. Other performers include the British artist Liam Payne and the American DJ Steve Aoki. The kingdom is also promising quick electronic visas for international visitors who want to attend.Over the past several months, the kingdom has seen performances by Mariah Carey, Enrique Iglesias, the Black Eyed Peas, Sean Paul, and the DJs David Guetta and Tiesto. That’s despite the widespread international backlash since October over the killing of the Saudi critic and writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents close to the crown prince in the kingdom’s consulate in Turkey.Such concerts are a stark change from when Saudi morality police would raid establishments that played loud music.Gender segregation between single men and women is still enforced in many restaurants, coffee shops, public schools and universities, but other rules have been loosened, with women now allowed to drive and attend events in sports stadiums."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09bffab23a489fe06d305196a3f4a017d3406b07/0_160_3952_2372/master/3952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=706be972f947c8576abce8ef256cc6c5","title":"power disability sport no bar cricket","story":"Disability is no bar to excellence – that’s the message of those working to bring physical disability cricket to a wider audienceHit hard, flat, true and with a whip-crack report, the ball is still gathering pace as it thuds against the back wall of the training centre.Heads nod amid whoops of approval and excitement at what this talent could bring to England’s cricket team. Not the bunch currently scrapping in the World Cup, or the team that will face Australia later this summer, but the gaggle of richly talented amateurs united by two powerful things they have in common: sport and disability.“Our most improved player over the last couple of years,” says Liam Thomas, the vice-captain of England’s physical disability side, of the ball hitter, Matt Askin. Ditching his prosthetic arm has liberated Askin. He now flourishes his bat like a cheerleader’s baton, larruping the ball further and faster than ever. “Hitting sixes with one hand, eh?” adds Thomas. “Amazing.”Teachers, tilers, students, water workers and biscuit exporters by day, the men gathered here for a weekend training session are the elite among 60,000 people with disabilities playing cricket at one level or another.Roughly one in five people in the UK report a disability and, according to a Sport England study in 2015-16, those who do are more than twice as likely to be physically inactive.“A 26-year-old lad got in touch,” said Neil Bradshaw, the operations manager for England disability cricket. “He was injured in service, is registered disabled and used to play for the army cricket team. He’s not been confident enough to reach out previously. He’s coming for a trial in August.”At the training session at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, everyone has a backstory – teenage bone cancer, amputation, club feet, missing limbs – but sympathy is neither sought nor required. Respect and a stage to perform on: that’ll do. That’s why they’re here. That and the chance to inspire the next generation to get involved.Joining the physically disabled elite at the weekend training camp are their counterparts from England’s deaf squad. This innovative joint residential jaunt has been designed to bring together four sides – those with physical disability (PD), deafness, learning disability and visual impairment – under the overall disability umbrella.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theSizing each other up in open-net sessions lends proceedings a keen edge on the cusp of a pivotal season, for the PD group in particular. Later this summer, England stages the first physical disability world cricket series, duking it out with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe across nine days of T20 action in the West Midlands.The hope is that exposure, and the seeing-is-believing nature of disability cricket, will help achieve what the likes of Anya Shrubsole and Steph Houghton have done for women’s sport. There are, as yet unconfirmed, plans to stream the games live. Millions would watch on the subcontinent. India’s involvement, backed by the all-powerful cricket authorities there, could be a gamechanger.“The number of blind cricketers alone in India would drown the number of visually impaired athletes in Paralympic programmes across the world,” says Ian Martin, the head of disability cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board. “And I think people often miss cricket’s appeal to people with all disabilities – we aim to include, not exclude. At grassroots level, we can be proud to say we welcome anyone.”Martin appreciates the game’s potential reach so keenly because the story is also autobiographical. A lifelong and passionate club cricketer diagnosed with the muscle- and nerve-wasting condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, he has singlemindedly pushed the disabled game forward over the past decade.“When I pull on my suit and look at the three lions on it, I’m able to think back to the dreams that I had as a kid about representing England at cricket and realise that I’ve achieved the dream and then some, just not in the way that I planned.”This summer is a watershed for Martin and Bradshaw, both backroom veterans. Martin brokered the first PD international, between England and Pakistan in 2012. Bradshaw, who knits logistics together across the board, finally gave up his Matalan warehouse shift manager’s gig to go full-time last year. His initial involvement, a decade back in Cheshire, was done as a favour. “I got into it simply because I fancied a pint at a cricket club,” he chuckles. “I saw 10-12 disabled kids running their own warm-up, so just started helping out.”Martin and Bradshaw are a tight partnership despite a bitter footballing rivalry (one is Everton, the other Liverpool). They have hundreds of shared miles under their belts building patiently for this moment. As Bradshaw sees it, fate just dealt these cricketers a different path: his remit is to push the envelope in search of validity.“That’s where our frustration lies,” he says. “This isn’t a sympathy setup because these lads can’t get access to their cricket anywhere else. The standard’s really high.“It’s educating people – getting away from the ‘oh, bless them, isn’t that nice?’ attitude. People don’t understand the game until they’ve seen the game.”Watching the training underscores his point: there is serious ability here, as evidenced when left-hander Thomas nails a succession of sweet shots against a bowling machine, deploying immaculate footwork. (His right leg ends just below the knee.)The coaching staff comprises ex-England Test cricketers Ian Salisbury and James Kirtley. The performance analyst, Chris Highton, is on hand to crunch the numbers and go through footage. Muscles and tweaks are tended by Scott Gormley and Richard Olejar, the latter physio a quietly spoken Slovakian taekwondo international known as “the assassin” for reasons that later become clear.After a couple of hours power-hitting in front of the bowling machines, there is a performance analysis seminar with Highton, who urges the players to embrace the data and make it work for them.“It’s about making strengths super-strengths and weaknesses strengths,” he says. Then it’s down to the nitty gritty: batters v bowlers in a series of T20 scenarios. Fielding and catching drills complete the afternoon’s work.”The competitive instinct kicks in when the different teams come together to test out their skills. There is an eye-catching exchange when deaf fast bowler George Greenway, capable of whistling it down at almost 80mph, takes on Liam O’Brien, who is not given to taking backward steps.“Make sure you say he didn’t get me out,” he says of the tussle. He’s only half joking.Honesty, friendship and integrity, winning on and off the pitch: these are constantly recurring themes across the weekend. Saturday evening is spent at the campus bar enjoying a couple of well-earned drinks, during which the squads start to mingle. Salisbury doesn’t bang the drum about curfews. He doesn’t have to: several of the players retreat to their digs before last orders.Sunday morning brings the opportunity to discover first-hand why Olejar has his nickname. Breakfast is at 7.45am. At 9am sharp, both squads – and, at Salisbury’s insistence, your 50-year-old correspondent – warm up with Olejar. For 45 minutes, we are put through a series of hops andor leaps up one, two, and then three steps. The theme to Rocky blares out as we pound the concrete.Then it’s rigorous stretching inside before getting down to work again.By about 4pm we are done. Everyone goes their separate ways, back to the day jobs. There is a wistful, end-of-school-term air as the players drift off. Liam O’Brien and spinner Fred Bridges plot their podcast listening on the journey back to Sussex.Dan Hamm, joker in the pack, alights upon Askin’s discarded prosthesis. “Look!” he says, waving it like a triumphant detective cracking a case, “we’ve found this – which must mean… there’s a body somewhere!” Askin, clearly familiar with this sketch, smiles and shrugs his shoulders.I mention that time has raced by: 48 hours gone in five minutes. “Yeah,” Askin concurs, smiling broadly. “I never want to go home.”• A version of this article appeared in Wisden cricket monthly"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945149.1562136761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new dawn for european politics as next leadership team nominated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAfter three days of unprecedented deadlock and whisperings, agreement has been reached on who should take the coveted top jobs in Europe.

Photograph: by Frederick FlorinAFPNigel Farage and his Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the European Parliament. As a saxophone quartet and opera singer performed Beethoven’s Ode to Joy in the Strasbourg chamber on the first day of the new parliament, the 29 Brexit party MEPs turned away from the group to face the back wall.Labour’s leader in the European parliament, Richard Corbett, later described the move as pathetic.More than three months after Britain was scheduled to leave the EU, 73 British MEPs have arrived in Strasbourg to take up a mandate that is due to expire on October 31st, the new deadline.The Brexit Party’s 29 MEPs marked their arrival in Strasbourg, with a photograph underneath the 28 national flags outside the Strasbourg parliament. A few wore turquoise ties, the colour of the party intended to mark the difference with Ukip purple, Mr Farage’s old party.Mr Farage, who has been an MEP since 1999, said Brexit Party MEPs would stay beyond October 31st “if we have to stay longer” and delivered a carefully-crafted message to the two Conservatives battling to become prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Crude slogan“Now we have two contenders telling us whatever happens, come hell or high water we are leaving on the 31st of October,” he said. “I don’t believe a word they say but I will give them this warning: if they don’t deliver Brexit on that date they are toast and then we will then see a turquoise takeover.”His new MEPs cheered as Mr Farage claimed the Brexit Party was the biggest in Europe. While the 29 Brexit MEPs are the joint largest party in the European Parliament (along with Germany’s CDU-CSU alliance), Mr Farage has been unable to forge a pan-European group, meaning he will no longer have a prime-time speaking slot in European Parliament debates.Massing on the other side of the parliament, the British Liberal Democrats also trumpeted their arrival by walking into the chamber together wearing yellow T-shirts emblazoned with their campaign slogan Bollocks to Brexit. The party has a record 16 MEPs, while Labour and the Conservatives have been reduced to all-time lows.Chris Davies, re-elected for the Liberal Democrats after losing his seat in 2014, said he expected to serve out his full five-year term. “Of course I do. If Brexit isn’t delivered by the 31st of October I don’t think it will happen. There is no majority in the country there is no majority in the House of Commons.”The MEP denied the crude slogan was unparliamentary. He said that when he met MEP colleagues who told him he would stay only a few months, “I say no. ‘I am here for five years. Bollocks to Brexit.’ And I get the same reaction every time: a big smile. It’s amazing how well Bollocks to Brexit translates into 24 different languages.”Protests were also held against the decision to deny a seat to Catalan separatist Carles Puigdemont and this issue was addressed by Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy. Newly elected Irish MEPs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly arrived for their first sitting of the parliament wearing matching teeshirts emblazoned with the slogan “Free Assange - No US extradition”. Tuesday marks the opening of the new five-year session of the parliament, though the length of the UK’s involvement remains in doubt.UK MEPs may sit in the parliament until the country formally leaves the EU.A deadline of October 31st has currently been set for the UK to leave, though this could be extended if a deal is not found by then. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945195.1562142444!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"another dubai princess defects anguished poetry ensues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum with Princess Haya, the most visible and glamorous of  his reported six wives, at the Epsom Derby festival  in England on June 3rd, 2017. Photograph:  Mark CuthbertUK Press via Getty ImagesFew world leaders are known to write poetry. Fewer still offer it up for public consumption. And almost none record their marital breakups in verse on their personal websites.Then there is the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who has been publishing his romantic anguish online, in Arabic and English, for anyone with an internet connection to read.“O sweetheart, there’s nothing more to say.Your deathly silence has worn me out,” he wrote in one poem posted on his official website. “You no longer have a place with me,” says another. “I don’t care if you live or die.”Princess Haya, the most visible and glamorous of the sheikh’s reported six wives, has left him. She fled with their 11- and 7-year-old children to London several months ago, a person close to the royal family said, making her at least the third woman to flee Sheikh Mohammed’s palaces in Dubai, the largest city of the United Arab Emirates.Haya (45) is seeking political asylum in Britain and is asking for a orce, said the person, who asked not to be identified speaking about a sensitive family matter. Her defection follows attempts by two of Sheikh Mohammed’s daughters, Sheikha Shamsa al-Maktoum and Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum. They were recaptured by Emirati forces and are said by advocates to be held in Dubai against their will.Haya has been criticised for her role in helping to, in the words of critics, whitewash the disappearance of Latifa, by inviting her friend, former president Mary Robinson, to visit Dubai and testify to Latifa’s well-being.Haya has not been seen recently or spoken publicly about her departure, and the sheikh’s poems do not identify the subject by name. The governments of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates did not respond to requests for comment.‘Perfect couple’Haya’s biography is well-travelled ground in the British press, which frequently reported her appearances, along with her husband, at Royal Ascot, the Epsom Derby and other highlights of the English equestrian calendar.She is a daughter of Jordan’s previous king, Hussein was educated at British private schools studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford represented Jordan as a showjumper at the 2000 Olympics is a former president of the International Equestrian Federation and is reported to be friendly, along with her husband, with Queen Elizabeth II.The Emirati press frequently wrote tributes to her humanitarian work and her marriage to Sheikh Mohammed (69), whom she wed in a small ceremony in Amman in 2004. “We can’t get enough of these two,” Emirates Woman magazine wrote in a feature titled “11 Moments Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya Were the Perfect Couple.”The article chronicled their joint visits to Royal Ascot where the sheikh, who owns a heavyweight racing stable in England called Godolphin, is a regular.But the princess was conspicuously absent at this year’s Royal Ascot in June. The Times of London reported on Monday that she was living with the couple’s two children, Sheikh Zayed and Sheikha Al Jalila, in a mansion near Kensington Palace worth about $107 million. Other unconfirmed media reports said that she first sought asylum in Germany before landing in London.A German government spokesman told The  earlier this week that it could not confirm the report, and the German interior ministry said it had no information on the case.Divorce is likely to be complicated for royals with two young children, billions of dollars and a tangle of political relationships, including the United Arab Emirates’ long-standing alliances with Britain and Jordan, at stake. The princess is a half sister of Jordan’s King Abdullah II.While men can easily orce their wives under Islamic law, which governs marriage in the UAE, women must go to court and overcome several legal barriers before they can end a marriage. Though orced women may retain day-to-day custody of children up to a certain age, legal ship of the children – and control of their education and finances – generally goes to the man.What makes Haya’s departure especially intriguing is her role in the case of Latifa – whose mother is another of the sheikh’s wives – and whether, at some point, she may shed more light on it.Robinson interventionLatifa tried to escape last year what she said was a suffocating existence in Dubai. She got as far as a yacht on the Indian Ocean, headed for India and then the United States, when she was forcibly retaken by armed Emiratis who took her back to Dubai, her companions said.Sheikh Mohammed’s office issued a statement in December, saying that she was safe in Dubai, celebrating her 33rd birthday with family “in privacy and peace”.Latifa has not been publicly seen since her escape attempt except in December, when her family released photographs of her meeting with Robinson, the former president of Ireland and United Nations human rights commissioner, in what seemed to be an attempt to show that the sheikha was alive and well.Haya, who has said she had been friendly with Robinson for years, had invited Robinson to Dubai for the visit. Both women drew criticism for appearing to help justify the disappearance of Latifa, who looked dazed and inert in the photographs.An activist who has worked on Latifa’s case, Radha Stirling, called on Princess Haya to co-operate with international authorities to investigate wrongdoing by Sheikh Mohammed. “Princess Haya, in all likelihood, is both a victim and a witness,” Stirling said in a statement. (A spokesman for the Jordanian Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The British Foreign Office declined to comment, and a spokesman for the British Home Office, which handles asylum claims, said the office could not comment on inidual cases.Though the couple were married in Jordan and are both Emirati citizens, James Stewart, an international family lawyer at Penningtons Manches Cooper in London, said orce negotiations could proceed in London as long as Haya could establish residency there.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignTory leadership latest: Jeremy Corbyn appears to back second referendum as he urges government to put the vote back to the people Dubai\u0026#39s Princess Haya battles billionaire ruler husband in UK High Court Theresa May denies she is \u0026#39running scared\u0026#39 over review into how UK Government can bolster UnionComment: The EU has just confirmed our worst fears about its empire-building fantasies Penny Mordaunt\u0026#39s call to change Northern Ireland’s \u0026#39appalling\u0026#39 abortion law prompts DUP backlash\u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 tells court of alleged abuse at hands of Lord Bramall as he claims he was raped by him at Army barracksBritish eco researcher drowns off coast of South Africa after yacht hit by stormHong Kong exposes the UK\u0026#39s lack of China policy and risks of its position Baby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: where, when and everything you need to know about the royal servicePrince Harry: Archie has taught me what it means to be a role modelAnalysis: Macron won the EU top jobs poker game -

But the French exchange is becoming a thing of the past, according to a British Council report which found that red tape is partly to blame for its decline.Sending children on exchanges has “fallen out of fashion” in part due to the “safeguarding culture” and Government red tape, according to Vicky Gough, schools advisor to the British Council.Guidelines from the Department for Education state that English families that host foreign pupils should undergo Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks and for this reason many schools and local authorities are put off, she said.“Because the regulations say parents should be DBS-checked, this makes people think this is a risky undertaking,” Ms Gough told the . “Some schools and local authorities don’t allow any to take place for this reason. The whole culture of safeguarding has changed”.Now just a quarter (25 per cent) of state secondaries now offer exchanges, down from 29 per cent last year and 30 per cent in 2014, the British Council’s annual language trends survey found.The poll of 1,600 teachers showed that while a greater proportion of private schools organise exchanges, they have seen a steeper decline over the same time period.Just under half (48 per cent) of fee-paying schools currently offer the trips, down from 53 per cent last year and 77 per cent in 2014.“When I was at school everyone did an exchange, everyone’s older brothers and sisters had done one,” Ms Gough said.“If it’s something that has always happened, pupils have heard about it from others and seen their photos, they feel comfortable.  “But when it falls out fashion and falls out of the school’s culture, it then sounds a bit odd and risky.”Ms Gough said that exchanges may be declining faster in private schools than in their state counterparts due to the management being more “risk averse” and cautionary.At a glance | How to learn another languageShe said state schools are under more financial as well as time pressure, and may not see organising exchange trips as a priority.Ms Gough told how at in the mid 1990s, every secondary school in Durham did one or even two exchanges, but now there is only one secondary left that does it.The number of pupils taking French and German GCSEs and A-levels has plummeted in recent years.Entries for GCSEs in both subjects has dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent. A-level entries are also declining, but at more gradual rate.Earlier this year, the Government set up a £2.5 million fund for schools to spend on taking disadvantaged children on trips abroad, including foreign language exchange trips. Ministers hope that the move will boost the numbers of pupils taking modern foreign languages at GCSE.Do you have fond memories of foreign exchanges from schooldays gone by?

That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told. In fact, you spend your le doing what you are told.Yes, sure there is an upside to that – the one thing I craved when I came out of boarding school was independence, and it gave me a survival instinct.But there are lots of downsides, too, which is why I didn’t send my kids to boarding school.Although, on reflection, maybe I should have . . .BREAKING news – the Miss England competition has launched a  make-up free round for the first time.The idea is to support body positivity and natural beauty.For ’s contest,  entrants – including  Bethany Cammack, trolled as a teenage beauty queen –  have been challenged to submit snaps of themselves with no make-up.It is a far cry from traditional Miss England competitions, where most wannabes have been plastered with more make-up than the average Love Island girl. So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course. AndI had to pick only one, it would be Tommy claiming Molly-Mae “refreshies me,”you really ­pushied me.The inescapable feeling, watching this series of Love Island, however, is that all the innocence and quite a lot of the charm has been lost forever, like, literally.Joe and Lucie — Jucie.Jordan and Anna — Jordanna.Anton and Belle — Bellend.FOLLOWING the main BBC News, from Glastonbury, and The One Show, from Glastonbury, there was a complete change of gear from the Beeb from .pm on Friday.Glastonbury, on every single BBC channel, with the usual cast of thousands playing presenter tag.So a gushing Clara Amfo threw to Mark Radclfe and Jo Whiley, who threw to Jack Saunders, at the John Peel stage, who threw to James Ballardie, who threw back to Jo Whiley and some new bloke called Huw Stephens, who threw . . .You get the point. There were busloads of them.Yet, with the honourable exception of Mark Radclfe, who’s a great broadcaster, the usual rules of presenting were suspended at Glastonbury.None of them were presentable, for a start.Genuine laughs were non-existent and nearly all critical faculties had been left at home, so they couldn’t even point out “s children’s TV presenter” wasn’t a good look for Tim Burgess, of The Charlatans, let alone hint that maybe Stormzy hadn’t had enough big hits to headline the Pyramid Stage.You’d imagine, then, that they all brought a breadth of knowledge and inside information that would illuminate the valley like , cigarette lighters being flipped on for a final encore.Jo Whiley: “Do you have any idea who might be coming out on stage with Stormzy ”Huw Stephens: “I have no idea.”But you’d imagine wrong.MEANWHILE, on recent episodes of ­EastEnders, the emaciated remains of Louise Mitchell have been found inside a shipping ­container that washed up in the Crimea, Keanu’s died after being tied to a chair and shoved off a tall building by Sharon, and new love interest Adrian Edmonson reacted to being doused in water by battering Jean Slater ­repeatedly round the head with a ­rubber frying pan and jabbing a fork into her ­buttocks.Not in broadcast episodes, obviously.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was asleep and then there was a huge impact.“The body literally landed one metre away from him and was obliterated. My friend was very shaken.“There were a few of us in the house at the time and it was lucky only one of us was in the garden.“Nobody would have survived being hit. The impact was horric.”John has been living in the property for around six months, moving in while working for Bobs firm Plexi, based in Bermondsey, London, and Birmingham.Another neighbour added: “I heard a whomp so I went to look out the window. At first I thought it was a tramp asleep. He had all his clothes on and everything.I had a closer look. I saw there was blood all over the walls of the garden and his head was not in a good way.The Clapham resident said a plane spotter, who had been following flight KQ on an app from Clapham Common, had seen the body fall, and arrived almost at the same time as the police.He added: “I spoke to Heathrow and they said this happens once every five years. There was a previous man who was frozen and this one, he was like an ice block.”The Kenya Airways flight passed over the house just after .pm on Sunday — descending to around ,ft and flying at mph as it prepared to land.Landlord Bob Renwicks brother said John “very badly shaken.He added: “It was a narrow miss. The garden isn’t very big.“There was more than a lot of blood. It wasn’t pretty and caused a signicant amount of damage.”The force of the impact was so severe that police were initially unable to tell whether the body was male or female.It is now understood the man was wearing a blue t-shirt and jeans. Forensics examined the scene for five hours before removing evidence.One female resident said: There was an almighty bang. My husband went out into the street where my neighbour was standing on the phone to the police.He was really shaken up. Hed been in the garden when it happened and the body must have landed so close to where he was.My husband came back in and I asked him what was going on and he said havent you seen the man  The man who fell from the sky I wondered what he was talking about and went up to see for myself and there in the middle of the lawn was a body of a man.The stowaway, who has not been identied, is believed to have been working at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. Investigators are understood to have found CCTV footage of him.A source told The Sun: “It looks highly likely he was an employee as security has been beefed up and no one without a pass could get near a plane. He could have been a baggage handler or one of a number of staff given airside clearance.“It’s possible that he could have bribed someone to get inside the perimeter but this seems unlikely and the CCTV will hold the key.”He is likely to have blacked out just  minutes after take-off as oxygen levels fell and would have been frozen to death by temperatures of around -.C.A source said: “There have been rare cases where stowaways have survived but in the main they lose consciousness because of a lack of oxygen and hypothermia and then they fall when the wheels go down.”A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “This is a shocking incident and our thoughts are with those involved.“While we do not comment on operational matters, we are liaising with the Kenyan authorities and the air carrier as they carry out their investigation into this incident.”Mozambican Carlito Vale hit an office roof in Richmond, South West London, in June  after plunging from a British Airways jet.A second man miraculously survived the same -hour flight from South Africa in the undercarriage of the plane.A -year-old Romanian man also survived in the undercarriage of a private jet from Vienna to Heathrow in .It had flown at comparatively low altitude with enough oxygen for him to breathe.But Turkish stowaway Kikmet Komur, , froze to death in the landing gear compartment of a BA jet in July .He hoped to get from Istanbul to the UK to see his girlfriend.There are no recorded incidents of anyone hit by a falling body from a plane in the UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These stick to the hair – usually close to the scalp – and are often still seen after treatment has killed all the lice.There are two main treatments for head lice. The first is strictly physical – wet combing using conditioner and a specially designed ‘bug busting’ comb.They can cause an itchy scalp and general discomfort as the parasites live by feeding on human blood.Nits are particularly common in school children aged between -.But heres some facts you might not have heard about nits...It’s time consuming and needs to be repeated several times - repeated every few days until you’ve had three sessions in a row where you have not seen any live lice.However, it is very effective when done properly and can be used regularly to check for new infestations.The second is to use topical treatments - lotions etc - to kill the bugs. These are ided into two main types.The first are chemical insecticides, which poison the lice. There have been lots of problems in recent years with head lice becoming resistant to these chemical insecticides.The second type is the physical insecticide.

The hospital has apologised to Wendy Robertson and son Daniel over his treatment. Ms Robertson, , had taken Daniel to Hullaposs Westbourne NHS Centre over fears he had a chest infection. The mum says she and Daniel, who is non-verbal and also has epilepsy, were then sent to Hull Royal Infirmary with a letter from the doctor advising that Daniel needed intravenous antibiotics. However, when the pair arrived they were sent to the acute medical unit where Ms Robertson says Daniel was left with bruises all over his body after nurses repeatedly tried to take blood samples off him, reports Hull Live. The Hull NHS trust has since apologised to Mrs Roberton, saying their standard of care fell short.  Ms Roberton said the pair arrived at the acute medical unit at pm, and it was four hours until they saw anyone. She said: A nurse came and said he had to have a blood test done and he was trying to take his bloods for what must have been about an hour but he couldnapost do it. He wanted to get some sleep and heaposd had enough by then. The nurse left and he left the needles and equipment in the room, which wasnapost very safe so I took them back out to the nursesapos station and she said she would tell the other one not to leave it there again.    But Mrs Roberton claimed her son was then left in a pool of urine for an hour, which she had to wipe up with her cardigan. She said: It got to .am and he wouldnapost sleep, he was scared and then he had an epileptic fit. I thought the stress of the day had brought it on. The next thing I know, the nurse who had done the bloods came back and I was ushered out of the room and lots of other doctors and nurses came running in. They shut the door and all I could hear was banging and crashing and really loud noises. I fell on the floor and had an asthma attack. I screamed out and managed to shout, aposDonapost hurt him.apos Someone came out and said I could then go in and see him.    Ms Roberton alleged that after the fit her son, who was  at the time, was left covered in bruises that spanned his whole body. When the pair got home, Ms Roberton - who is Danielaposs full-time carer - said she immediately noticed a change in her son and a week later called up PALS . Letter of apology from nurses Soon after the incident, which happened on March  this year, she received a call and a letter of apology from the wardaposs matron who said that an unacceptable amount of time was taken trying to take blood from Daniel. She was offered a home visit by some of the hospitalaposs nurses but turned it down. A letter she was sent said: Please accept my sincere apologies for the distress your son and you have experienced as a result of the circumstances. The issues have been investigated and then shared with myself, senior matron. I contacted you to discuss the findings and it was clear through discussion that your son was let down by the team and I was saddened to learn that your son is now very scared of hospitals.    An unacceptable amount of time was spent trying to obtain a blood sample and his hygiene needs were not met. Sister X will remind the team that they must work within their limitations andthey are not able to obtain a blood sample in a timely manner they are to seek support from the anaesthetic team who are experts in obtaining blood samples and access in dficult circumstances.

I would like to assure you that this Trust takes complaints seriously and full investigation has been undertaken. Please accept my sincere apologies for any distress that this may have caused. aposWeaposve had three months of hellapos Since his hospital stay, Ms Roberton said Daniel now refuses to leave the house and has stopped going to a day care facility that he once loved. She said: Weaposve had three months of hell. He wonapost leave the house, he wonapost eat and I have to get him to drink. He gets up in the morning and spends five hours in a room and wonapost come out. He has tried to harm himself too. He is petried and this has traumatised him.

Xavier Parkins  was crowned the Lees Brook Community Schoolaposs prom queen in Derbyshire last week. Days before he turned  the teenager strutted his stuff in outfit starring a short, pink strapless dress that took six hours to perfect. He became the first boy to win the schoolaposs prom queen at the event at Pride Park Stadium in Derby, Derbyshire Live reported. While the reaction to his victory has largely been positive, some people have aimed jibes at Xavier, suggesting he aposneeded a father figure in his leapos and that a girl should have won the crown.    But he isnapost bothered by the haters. He said: Every negative comment has made me laugh, Iaposve turned it into a positive. Negative comments make me want to do it even more. They make me want to put four wigs on at a time and wear five layers of foundation. I read through all the comments but Iaposve only responded to two or three ones which got to me because of how personal they were. Xavier said the comments question whether he should have won havenapost affected him because of the positive things he associates with dragging up. Getting all the attention was good and Iaposm grateful for it but it isnapost what I intended, he continued. Drag makes me feel so empowered and confident, itaposs just fun. Iaposm just being me but I look dferent. Winning Prom Queen is what every girl wants.  Xavier first went out wearing make-up at a show when he was invited up on stage with RuPaulaposs Drag Race judge Michelle Visage. When he won a lip-syncing competition at the show he decided to dress in drag at the prom. He bought his first wig on a shopping trip and went home to dance around his living room while wearing his mumaposs heels.    More wigs followed as Xavier starting building a collection of his own home-made clothes. The teenageraposs family have been supportive as have his friends, who said the idea to don a dress at the event was sick. His mum Sharnee, , said some people who commented were using religion to justy their actions.    She added: You do read the comments and it is very dficult not to reply, but sometimes silence is more powerful. People messaged me saying seeing Xavier has really helped their child and thataposs just wonderful. Itaposs so unexpected actually and thataposs just the icing on the cake. Iaposm so proud. Xavier is set to perform at Derby Pride on September .    Toni Jacobs, a trustee for Derby Pride, said: It’s truly heartwarming to see a local school supporting the right of young people to express themselves freely. Drag has always been a very important part of LGBT+ culture, both as a performance and as a way of exploring gender identity and self-expression. Encouraging and supporting young people to be themselves is very important and celebrating ersity leads to a more accepting society for all.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bumble couple who married first","story":"NewsBumble couple who married on first date in Las Vegas orce after just two monthsSarah Elliott and Paul Edwards tied the knot in Las Vegas on Christmas Day just hours after they met at Gatwick AirportShareCommentsByChris kitchingSenior Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv tv-news video bumble-couple-who-married-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA nanny who married a stranger just days after they met on the Bumble dating app says she got a orce after just two months toto her polyamorous lestyle. Sarah Elliott, , and lighting technician Paul Edwards, , tied the knot in Las Vegas on Christmas Day just hours after they met in person for the first time. The pair wore their wedding outfits at Gatwick Airport as they boarded a flight to the US. They had matched on the dating app just ten days earlier and even before meeting face-to-face they had the crazy idea to have a shotgun wedding. Ms Elliott - who later revealed her love of BDSM and sex fetish parties - said her marriage is over and she has sworn off monogamy.    The couple had been living with two of her ex-boyfriends, also called Paul, and there were claims Sarah was sacked from her job as a nanny after photos of her at BDSM and sex fetish parties emerged. One showed her walking around in a topless corset and leading around a man in golden mask at a Torture Garden event in Brighton. Ms Elliott has said she loves being a dominatrix and she has had trouble finding a man to keep up with her high sex drive.  She said she is now dating two toy boys - aged  and  - and will never settle for having just one partner again. She also said she will never date another man named Paul again. She told the Sun: “My marriage may be over but it has opened me up to a whole new world.  “I no longer believe monogamy and marriage is the be-all and end-all. “Now I’m living the polyamorous lestyle and loving it. She claims she tried to introduce her then-husband to the world of BDSM and sex fetishes, even taking him to a Torture Garden event in Brighton, where Ms Elliott was previously pictured topless.  She claims they went to a swingers’ night at Le Boudoir, a club in central London, shortly before they split, but it only further strained their relationship. Ms Elliott claims they split for good just days before their two-month anniversary after couplesapos counselling failed. Mr Edwards hasnapost commented on the split.  Ms Elliott, originally from New Zealand and now living in Crowborough, East Sussex, said her family and friends thought she was bonkers for marrying a complete stranger, so the orce did not come as a surprise to them. She had previously told how the marriage was rocky while she and Mr Edwards were living with two of her ex-boyfriends. Despite everything they had talked about having children. Dad-of-two Mr Edwards had moved from his home in Chichester, West Sussex, to be with his new we. Ms Elliott said the former couple still speak, but they have not seen each other since they split in February.

But a CCTV camera at the Judge Roy Beans bar in Newbridge, Co Kildare, Ireland, caught her appearing to place the shard in her own mouth.Pub owner Vivian Carroll told Irish Mirror: Sadly, this is typical of what I and many other publicans face on a weekly basis. It’s clear from the footage that after hiding glass in her clothes, this person then deliberately places it in her mouth. She told a member of staff that the glass was in her food, which was obviously not the case. Butit wasn’t for security cameras I could possibly have faced a massive claim.    She said the entire incident had been recorded and the Gardaí were alerted, but they let her go after taking her details. Padraig Cirbben, chief executive of Vintneraposs Federation of Ireland, slammed the aposcompo cultureapos saying it could force businesses to close. He said: The so-called aposcompo cultureapos stems from the fact that people think they can get away with making outrageous insurance claims, a belief supported and encouraged by some within the legal sector and facilitated by insurers settling dubious claims.    Peter Boland, director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, said: This footage is a timely reminder of the type of personal injury incidents experienced by organisations all over Ireland and the crippling insurance costs they cause. Unsustainable insurance costs are now pervasive right across Irish society and threaten the ability of small businesses, charities, voluntary groups, sports and arts organisations and festivals toor survive.Equally, incidents like this demonise legitimate claimants for whom insurance cover is intended.    He added: The slow pace of reform by Government to address this crisis is compounding the issue. Despite all the political promises we have heard, we have yet to see tangible evidence of reforms that will make a real dference.  Reforms like the establishment of a fully-funded and resourced Gardaí response, a meaningful reduction in the level of general damages being granted for minor, fully-recovered injuries and a commitment from the insurance industry to quanty the scale of promised premium reductions.

The Kenya Airways plane was flying from Nairobi to Heathrow when the manaposs body crashed into the garden of a Clapham home just ft from a sunbather. The head of Kenyaaposs Civil Aviation Authority said the stowaway likely had access to secure areas at the main airport in Nairobi and was likely a worker there. He could have been a baggage handler, it was reported. Kenyan media said British authorities have sent the dead manaposs fingerprints to the counterparts in Nairobi in an attempt to identy him. Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror.    CCTV from the airport was being reviewed as part of the case which has raised concerns about security. The stowaway - wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt - landed just ft from Oxford graduate John Baldock, a software engineer who was sunbathing in the garden of his rented home. Neighbours described a sickening thud, or whomp, as the body landed, leaving a crater in the lawn and smashing concrete path to bits. A neighbour said the body was intact and frozen like an ice block after it landed.  They said Mr Baldock, who is in his s, was left so shaken at the bloody scene that he had trouble speaking afterwards and he later left the home to be with family in Exeter, Devon. The stowaway was in the landing gear compartment, and it is believed he was already dead when his body plunged from the Boeing  Dreamliner as its wheels were lowered. The plane landed at Heathrow about ten minutes after the body fell at about .pm on Sunday. A bag, water and some food were found in the landing gear compartment of the plane after it completed the ,-mile flight.  A post-mortem is due to be held to determine the cause of death, which is not being treated as suspicious. Gilbert Kibe, director of the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, told BBC Africa that it was unlikely an outsider breached security, crossed the runway and climbed into the plane without being noticed. He insisted there was tight security at Nairobiaposs Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, where the flight took off on Sunday morning for its nine-hour journey to London. Mr Kibe added: They do check every part of the aeroplane, including the undercarriage, the wheels, the breaks, the tyre condition, the wheel well that is above there. They inspect everything.  So when those checks were being done, it is not likely that person was there, otherwise he would have been seen. So at which point the person gained access, that is the mystery. He said the stowaway could have been a worker who had legal access to the airport. A source told the Sun: “It looks highly likely he was an employee as security has been beefed up and no one without a pass could get near a plane. He could have been a baggage handler or one of a number of staff given airside clearance.  “It’s possible that he could have bribed someone to get inside the perimeter but this seems unlikely and the CCTV will hold the key.” There have been a number of cases in the UK and around the world in recent years where stowaways have breached airport security. Meanwhile, a witness who saw the body fall from the plane as it prepared to land at Heathrow has told how he raced to the scene and said to Mr Baldock: It was a body, wasnapost it  The man said he was sunbathing in his garden on the bright and warm Sunday afternoon when he saw the plane and spotted a falling object. He told LBC: My friend thought it was just debris but as it got closer and closer it was clear it was a body.  He said the body fell for about  seconds and appeared limp. The man checked a flight-tracking app on his phone and worked out that it was Kenya Airways flight KQ from Nairobi to Heathrow. He jumped on his bike to look for the scene and eventually followed a police car to the property where the body landed. The man added: I just shouted at [the sunbather] aposIt was a body wasn’t it apos and he nodded. The witness gave the flight details to police, and thataposs how officers were able to get authorities at Heathrow to check the plane.  He said it was a miracle no-one on the ground was killed. A male neighbour said the tragedy could have been much worse. The body would have landed in packed Clapham Common had it fallen just two seconds later, he said. Kate Armstrong, , an au pair who lives near Mr Baldock, told the Times that she thought the falling stowaway was a drone. She said: I was doing gardening and I saw something in the sky - it looked like a drone. I didnapost think anything of it. I was in disbelief when I found out. It is believed the man was dead as he fell from the plane. He would have had to survive almost nine hours starved of oxygen and temperatures of around -C at an altitude of ,ft.

The four-day-old boy, named Riley by family members, died in hospital on Wednesday morning, the Met Police confirmed as they attempted to identy the man in the CCTV footage. In the video, the man is seen walking towards Ms Fauvrelleaposs home at about .am on Saturday and just over ten minutes later he is seen running back along the same street away from the mum-to-beaposs address in Thornton Heath, said police.

Ms Fauvrelle, who was eight months pregnant, was found suffering stab injuries and died at the scene. Her son was delivered at the scene by paramedics and taken to hospital, where he had been in a critical condition until his death.

She was a sweetheart an absolute sweetheart. The most gentle loving person and being a mum was all she dreamed about. Ms Fauvrelle, who turned  in May, had posted photos on Facebook showing her posing with a cake reading See you soon, Riley. A helium-filled balloon next to her had the message Itaposs a boy. Another photo, posted on Valentineaposs Day, showed an ultrasound image of the baby, who was due to be born within weeks. Ms Fauvrelle, a motorcycle enthusiast who had passed her bus driving licence and previously worked for Transport for London, wrote on Facebook: Happy Valentineaposs sweet pea ... we canapost wait to meet you.  Police have described the murder investigation as fast-paced and extremely challenging. The force acknowledged speculation that Ms Fauvrelleaposs attacker was known to her, but said we simply are not in a position to say and we must retain an open mind. Police have appealed for people who recognise the man in the video to contact detectives. A spokesman for the force said: In the CCTV a man is seen walking towards Kellyaposs address at around .am. Just over  minutes later, the same male can be seen running back along Raymead Avenue, away from Kelly’s address, toward Colliers Water Lane.  Detective Chief Inspector Mick Norman, of the Metaposs Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: This morning, we heard the sad news that Kelly’s baby son, Riley, has died in hospital.

All of Linda Harlowaposs children have attended the same primary school in Ash Vale, Surrey - with at least one child there continuously since . And -year-old Linda has got the morning and afternoon regime down to a fine art, to the envy of many other parents. But that will all stop soon when son Zachary leaves Holly Lodge Primary School, marking the end of almost three decades of packing lunches and waiting at the same school gates. So when Zachary leaves for the final time at .pm on July , it will be just as disorientating for her as it is for him, reports Surrey Live.    Linda said: In some ways it will be a relief but I think I will miss it. After  years you get used to the same routine. Her eldest, Rebecca Lamberth, is now  and first joined Holly Lodge in January . Rebecca would become something of a trailblazer for the family with Benjamin Lamberth, , Daniel Lamberth, , Abigail Lamberth, , a son Linda has lost contact with who is , and Naomi Kenton, , all following suit. The remarkable run was nearly broken when there was an almost seven-year age gap between Naomi and Lindaaposs seventh child, Evie Harlow, being born. But due to how their birthdays fall, Evie, who is now , started Reception just as Naomi left Year . Three years later Zachary, , started at Holly Lodge. Getting in and out of the house with one child can be a challenge, so with eight it had to be done with military precision, and the kids were all well trained. I sounded like a stuck record basically, said Linda.Iaposd say aposshoes on the rack, hand mummy your coats, slippers onapos. What my husband [Michael Harlow, ,] loved was seeing all the dferent coloured beakers in the kitchen lined up.    People used to say I looked like a mother duck with all her little ducklings, walking down the road. Linda said she would like £ for every time Iaposve done the walk on the school run and it would earn her a decent sum too.She has walked the half-mile route from her home or the reverse journey a combined total of more than , times. With children in the youngest years having a shorter day, at times she was walking there and back twice in a day. Holly Lodgeaposs current inclusion manager Carol Pedley has known Linda since her son Simon started at the school at the same time as Rebecca Lamberth. Mrs Pedley, , who started working at Holly Lodge in , said it was a bit of a running joke when Linda brought a new child into Reception.She said: It was just a production line.

A pollen bomb has hit following last weekaposs mini-heatwave and counts will remain at dangerously high levels as temperatures rise to C on Thursday and C on Friday. Grass pollen season peaks during the first two weeks of July. More than three million asthma sufferers are at risk of a potentially deadly attack, and they have been advised to stay indoors. For about  million hay fever sufferers, this weekaposs sunny and warm weather could be ruined by symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, runny or blocked noses, or headaches .    The Met Office said Wednesdayaposs pollen levels are very high across England and Wales, and high or medium in parts of Scotland. Northern Irelandaposs pollen count is medium. The conditions will affect people in rural areas and cities, where hay fever is made worse by pollution. Temperatures will soar into the mid to high s in southern England and Wales this week with long spells of sunshine for some places.  Caroline Fredericks, Specialist Nurse at Asthma UK, said: “Peaking levels of grass pollen and hot weather this week could cause suffering for around . million people whose asthma could be affected by hay fever. “If you have asthma, then an allergy to pollen can inflame your airways and trigger asthma symptoms such as coughing, a tight chest and breathlessness, which could lead to a potentially le-threatening asthma attack.Hot weather this week will make the pollen levels spike and cause extra misery for people with asthma. “If you have asthma that is triggered by hay fever make sure you keep your blue reliever inhaler with you at all times. Take hay fever medicines and your preventer inhaleras prescribed. This yearaposs hay fever season started three weeks early thanks to an unusually warm winter that brought record-breaking highs of C in February and spring temperatures that were ten degrees warmer than usual.    Tree pollen, which affects one in four hay fever sufferers, was released earlier than usual. The season normally runs from late March to the middle of May. Grass pollen season has two peaks between mid-May and mid-July , and weed pollen season covers the end of June to September. When grass pollen levels are high, more people are admitted to hospital with asthma attacks, said Asthma UK. About  per cent of people with hay fever are affected by grass pollen. Symptoms include sneezing and coughing, a runny or blocked nose itchy, red or watery eyes, an itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears, loss of smell, pain around the temples and forehead, headaches, earaches, and tiredness. Hay fever is a problem for about  per cent of people with asthma. People who suffer from hay fever should avoid alcohol, as it is known to worsen their symptoms.

In the lead up to her Royal Wedding to Prince Harry and in the year since, the Duchess of Sussex has dealt with numerous embarrassing outbreaks from her dad Thomas and sister Samantha. According to insiders her new father-in-law Prince Charles has been a huge source of support during some of the tougher times, which we saw when he offered to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, and the Queen is also happy with how sheaposs dealt with the drama. A source told the Mirror: “The Queen is very fond of Meghan, as is Charles, and they both believe she has dealt with the situation in a dignied manner.    The whole family is ­sympathetic on how much she has had to deal with.” The heir to the throne has become very protective of his daughter-in-law, who he calls “Tungsten” because she is as “tough and unbending”, and they are understood to spend a lot of time together during family trips. A senior royal source said: “Meghan’s overriding view is that there is no place for her father or his extended family in her le right now. She has a strong family unit around her in Harry, with their ­adorable newborn son, and he has been very, very clear that she only wants ­positive influences for Archie.    “If anything she has developed a strong bond with Harry’s father and has discussed the situation with him. “She definitely sees Charles as a father figure, a principled man who has had his le played out in the public eye. “Despite the desperate pleas from the family, there is zero chance of a ­reconciliation at this stage.    Meghanaposs -year-old father recently used an intermediary to “reach out” to her, however she flatly refused to respond to him, saying she has been “grossly betrayed”, despite other members of the Markle family suggesting she should offer an olive branch. Meghan has had no contact with Thomas since she wrote him a letter in August last year begging him to stop launching hurtful public attacks on her and the Royal Family.

Albert Grannon, , fired a single shot in the direction of Stanley Metcalfe, making a hole the size of a p piece in the stomach of the six-year-old who was stood only a few feet away. Football-mad Stanley shouted “why did you shoot me, granddad ” moments after being struck on July  last year in Sproatley, near Hull. In the photo, posted in December last year, Grannon - wearing a white tuxedo - flashed a wide grin as he posed alongside his we Jenner onboard a luxury cruise liner. It includes a caption wishing all members of this site a very happy Christmas and New Year. The picture, from , was shared again last year as Stanleyaposs parents and young sister struggled to cope with his loss which took place just months before.    His grieving mum Jenny Dees claims Mr Grannon has never apologised and accused him of showing a lack of remorse . Stanleyaposs family found the snap particularly galling as it came just one day after what would have been Stanleyaposs seventh birthday, according to the Daily Mail. Ms Dees, who is Grannonaposs granddaughter, said: “Not once did he say sorry. Now,he did, it would be meaningless, too little, too late. I hope you can live with yourself.” Ms Dees said that, immediately after the incident, she felt sorry for her grandfather but she told a judge: I donapost feel sorry for him now. She added: Our whole word has changed forever. It is unbearable, we struggle to live, to eat and breathe. Nothing will make this better, our hearts are totally broken.    The pain in my heart is unbearable, I cry and cry and sometimes I think I am not going to stop. The only reason Iaposm still here is because of [Stanleyaposs twin sister] Elsie. Le is so hard to carry on with. Everything seems so pointless. Our family is broken beyond repair. Earlier she said: I have had no remorse shown to me. I have had no apology and that is unbearable and unbelievable to see. I loved and respected my granddad so much and the day Stanley died I thought he would come to me and say he was sorry, why wouldnapost he  But he didnapost. People say he is in shock and that he will say sorry afterwards. We are nearly up to a year now and he hasnapost. I do believe thatyou cause the death of somebody, regardless of whether you meant to or not, there should be a punishment in place and that is going to prison. She spoke out shortly before Grannon was jailed for three years at Sheffield Crown Court on Tuesday. He had previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter and possessing an adapted air rle without holding a firearms certicate.    Before discharging the fatal shot the -year-old had squeezed the trigger of the gun while checking to seeit was loaded. He first told paramedics he had fired the gun at the floor only for the pellet to ricochet and hit Stanley. Experts examining the projectile quickly disputed this claim. Stanleyaposs devastated father Andrew Metcalf took to the stand at Sheffield Crown Court and said: “On the  of July our little world came crashing down. “Stanley, my son and best friend had his le taken away. “Every morning and every night I go into Stanleyaposs room and still tell him aposyouaposre my best friend and I love youapos. “Thereaposs no reply, and kissing his pillow is not quite the same as kissing your son goodnight.  Paul Genney, defending Grannon, told the court: “These are my instructions, he held the rle and squeezed the trigger to seeit was loaded whilst pointing the rle at the child but, of course, not deliberately.” Mr Genney said Grannon was “particularly concerned” about the issue of remorse. He told the court: “He instructs me he has been reluctant to communicate with the parents and the mother because in the early stages of the ongoing police investigation he was told that would be an inappropriate thing to do, probably wrongly.” Mr Genney added Grannon feels remorse and blames himself totally and said the “irretrievable ision between the family has compounded the tragedy”. Sentencing Grannon, the judge, Mr Justice Lavender said: “You ended a young le and you brought lelong grief and misery to his parents and to the whole family.  “Tragically, this happened when the family had gathered at your home to mark the fteenth anniversary of the death of your son, Andrew. “July  this year will mark the anniversary of two deaths instead of one. “No sentence I impose can bring Stanley back. No sentence I impose can undo what you have done and heal the rts in your family. “In all circumstances, what you did was obviously a very dangerous thing to do. Why on earth did you do it  “I have read your statement and I readily accept that your remorse for what you did to your great-grandson is genuine and profound, although you have not succeeded in conveying that to your granddaughter and her family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"susie boniface learning idol ensured","story":"NewsopinionLearning from her idol Venus ensured Coco was set for Wimbledon victorySusie Bonace celebrates Coco Gauffs incredible Wimbledon win over former champ Venus WilliamsShareCommentsBySusie Bonace:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsopinionCoco beat Venus in straight sets\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSome people would crow about smashing a former champion out of Wimbledon. Not Coco Gauff. The -year-old reacted to her win with grace and charm, just like the defeated Venus Williams. And between them, they provided the best news of the week. We watch sport for the stories. Coco was the youngest player to qualy for the event since . Venus was the oldest woman in the draw. Youthful enthusiasm took on a woman of experience, and won in straight sets. Coco – real name Cori – was also a wildcard, just like a -year-old Boris Becker back in . Who could forget him vaulting over the Centre Court net after clinching the championship  It was a joy to hear people chant “Boris! Boris!” then. Not so much today. But most importantly, Coco was playing a woman she’d looked up to since Venus inspired her to pick up a racket aged seven. To compete against what you worship is hard, to win astounding – and Coco managed it for one simple reason. Over years of coaching she learned to focus like Venus and her sister Serena, whose picture was on her bedroom wall, urging her on. She trained, studied, suffered, strived, to be like them. And then she went on to Court One, brought her own game, and won.    Every strand of the story in that match is inspiring, but none more so than the power of having a good role model. Whether it’s Venus, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, or Ellen White, an adult who, win or lose, plays a good game gives youngsters a space they can grow into, and then grow out of. It’s like parenting, in a way, but on a grander, better-paid, and less-forgiving scale. Parents are always flawed, because we see them up close. An idol is distant and perfect, which is why the public get so disgusted when other pictures on bedroom walls turn out to include adulterers, gamblers, or tax dodgers. Venus Williams has known for  years the responsibility of being so admired. Perhaps that’s why after losing to Coco she made a brief appearance for the cameras to congratulate her, before retiring to punch the wall in private.    One of my idols was a chief reporter on my first local paper. She taught me how to handle death knocks, sub editors and Fleet Street drinking games. Another was my gran, who railed at Tories after Sunday lunch and baked stonking cakes. I remember being , desperate to have a purpose, and adulthood, and the ability to have a crack at all these things. They taught me how, just like Venus did Coco. Idols matter. Applaud Coco for finding her purpose, and applaud Venus for delivering it.

The heat will steadily increase this week as temperatures rise from highs of C today to C tomorrow and C on Friday. The mercury will be fairly high across the country today, with most of the country experiencing temperatures in the late teens to early s. While tomorrow will be hotter in the south of the UK, it will be a milder day for Scotland, which will likely be hit by rain. Most of of Wales, central, north-west, east, north-east, south, south-east and south-west England will bask in sunshine today, with similar conditions tomorrow. Friday should be even sunnier, although there will be cloud and potentially rain in Scotland and north-west England.    Meteorologists reported recorded the Earthaposs hottest June on record last month, with Europe coming to a standstill during an unprecedented heatwave last week. The EUaposs satellite agency reported June was the warmest on record, with average European temperatures C higher than normal. Climate change made the European heatwave last week at least five times as likely to happen, analysis suggests. Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the environmental change institute at the University of Oxford and one of the experts behind the analysis, said: This is a strong reminder again, that climate change is happening here and now. It is not a problem for our kids only.  Both observations and models show a strong trend towards stronger heatwaves. However, the observed trend is stronger than the modelled one, and we do not yet know why. Temperatures observations suggest the kind of extreme heat seen last week has become at least  times, and potentially  times, more likely since , analysis from the World Weather Attribution group found. But the scientists said other factors were at play which affect temperatures, along with climate change, such as changes to land use, air pollution and irrigation. The Met Office said the UK was spared the scorching temperatures seen in parts of Europe as a result of an undercut of cooler air coming in from the North Sea. A netweather.tv spokesman said: The UK managed to escape the most extreme heat thanks to an easterly wind off the North Sea, which is still relatively cool at this time of year. Even so, a top June temperature of .C at Heathrow and Northolt occurred on Saturday  June. Not far off the all time June record of .C. Without that undercut of less hot air, the record would have fallen in the stling air from the south.  Despite the heat, Britain saw widespread flooding in June, with over a monthaposs worth of rainfall falling in some areas in less than  hours. The worst of the weather hit Lincolnshire, south-east England and parts of Wales and Scotland. The Met Office even issued a danger to le warning as a result of the fast flowing floodwater in some parts of the country.

Speaking to the Mail Online, Alexandria said: My parents are monsters. They are evil people. We were abused repeatedly by our mom and our dad is so in love with her he never did anything to stop her. Looking back on it, it was pure hell. A nightmare no child should have to endure. My mother used to weigh me, she would make me strip off my clothing and step on the scale. One day, when I was eight years old, she chained me to my bed with a heavy-duty dog chain so she could control what I ate.    Anastaisea claims the chain was wrapped around her ankle and secured with a padlock.

Then I went to Tesco and they had the one that blew my mind.I used to be quite plain and just eat egg, but I saw the southern fried chicken wrap and oh my god, my le changed.She continues: From that day onwards that was it, I decided that was the meal I was going to have to eat for the rest of my le - every day.    I have bought one every day for the last two years, it has been pure dedication and it got so bad that evenI was hungover or too tired to leave the house, I would get my housemates to go and get me one. To commemorate her special relationship with the meal deal, Lizzie headed to a tattoo parlour a few weeks ago and asked to have a picture of the wrap put on her leg. She admits her parents rolled their eyes when they saw what sheaposd done and her friends were gobsmacked.    But she got a great reaction from Tesco, who thought the inking was brilliant. The company reached out and sent Lizzie a goodie box full of treats from the store - though there was one thing missing. She added: They sent me an email and just told me they wanted to thank me, but they also sent me a mystery box full of crisps and chocolate as well as a thank you card. I appreciated it of course, but they could have at least sent the meal deal that I loved so much, or a £ voucher to buy a few of them.

Luke Freeman, , from Reading, Berks, died instantly after falling from tourist apartments in the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar just before .am yesterday morning. Police are treating the tragedy as an accident after concluding that he lost his balance and toppled over the balcony after a night out with friends. He was staying at Apartamentos Trimar in the centre of Lloret but had gone back to another block with six friends who had checked in a week earlier.    They were due toto the UK late yesterday after giving statements to police. Close friend Jack Luttman, also from Reading, said: “Words can’t explain how devastated I am. “Luke Freeman, you were like a brother to me and I’ll always love you man. “Rest easy bro. Thank you for all the memories you have given me since the age of six. You were truly a legend. “And you have no idea how much you will be missed by me and everyone who knew you. RIP.” Berkshire-based DJ Mark Shepherd-Ellis, in a message for music fan Luke, said: “Having a beer for you now. The sky has been blessed.” A spokesman for record label and events firm Faded Audio said in a social media post: “We’ve heard the sad news about Luke Freeman. “It’s never nice to lose someone so young. We remember Luke being at our first-ever event having it off at front barrier for most of the night.    “Hope you rave it hard in paradise young king. May you rest easy.

Thinking of you all.” A spokesman for the Guardia Civil said: “I can confirm a British man has died after falling from a fth-floor balcony in Lloret de Mar. “He was on holiday in the area.” A well-placed source said: “An investigation is underway and is being conducted by Mossos d’Esquadra in the nearby town of Blanes but witnesses have said it was an accident and he wasn’t trying to jump from balcony to balcony or anything like that. “It’s a matter for the investigation but given the time it happened, at .am in the morning, officers will be looking at whether the holidaymaker had been out for the night andalcohol played a part in the tragedy.”    It was initially believed Luke had been staying at the apartments where he died but investigators later confirmed he was a guest where. Some of the friends he was with are understood to have seen him plunge to his death and spent most of yesterday at a police station giving statements before flying home. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: “We are assisting the family of a British man who died in Lloret de Mar and are in contact with the Spanish police.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eclipse blocks out sun stunning","story":"Eclipse blocks out the Sun as stunning images show rare solar phenomenonThe total solar eclipse plunged areas of South America into darkness, with crowds watching on in aweShareCommentsByMatthew DreschSteve Cutner:,  JUL NewsThese stunning images show last nights total solar eclipse in all its spectacular glory.

Margarita Grachyova, , was forced into a car by partner -year-old Dimitry Grachyov and driven to a forest where he forced her to kneel before the horric attack. The psychologist carried out the vicious act in December  after becoming convinced she was having an affair. Now he is serving a -year jail sentence and she is determined to look sexy again after posing for glamour pictures in her native Russia. Margarita - or Rita - has won admirers around the world for the “inspirational” way she has rebuilt her le after the brutal attack. One hand was sewn back on - giving her limited use. The other was too badly damaged and she had an articial limb attached leading her young sons to call her “transformer mum”.    Posting her new pictures, she asked her social media followers: aposSexuality - how does it manest itself  “Right after the tragedy of  December , it seemed to me, and I sometimes still think so now, that I am no longer attractive. “Before I was a girl without any defects. “But I turned into a girl with no hand - and lots of scars on my left arm and leg. “To be honest, I have not learned to accept myself as I am. “Sometimes I am very upset and annoyed that my left hand looks chubby and blue from scars. “And the black prosthesis - it doesnapost really match a blue dress…. aposAnd when I wear a short skirt, four huge scars are visible on my leg. aposBut sexuality is not only the look, theof legs, and hair. “It is something deeper, something inside.”   She won thousands of likes for her postings on Instagram and Russian social media VK.Her profile reads: “Transformer-mum, two sons and a cat. Everything is in your hands evenyou have only one.” Saying she is now single after starting orce proceedings against her jailed husband, she confessed: “I am not giving up on a private le, but I have slightly dferent priorities now.” Margarita has learned to e and said: “I want to jump with a parachute but have not done so yet.” She is also writing a book on domestic violence - based on her own experiences - along with her journalist mother. “I hope that some girl will read it and leave her tyrant husband,” she said, arguing her experience can be a warning to other women. She won a string of admitting comments for her pictures. “You are so pretty, I sincerely admire you,” said one. Another posted: “Well done, Rita! Great happiness in le!” Her husband was jailed after a court case in Serpukhov, near Moscow, in which she cross-examined him. “No verdict willmy hands,” she said after the November case. And no [jail] term will. “I will have to live with it for the rest of my le.”    He showed “no remorse”, said Margarita, who denied she was unfaithful to her husband. Margarita’s left hand was sewn back on by surgeons, and she now has a “robot” right arm which she is learning to use as she rebuilds her le and cares for the couple’s two sons. Grachyov was found guilty by judge Irina Pantela of threatening his we with murder, kidnap, and causing her serious physical harm. Earlier he was stripped of his rights to raise the couple’s children. He told the court gruesome details of how he severed her hands after dragging her out of his car. “I wrapped ropes around her arms, next to her shoulders, in two places,” he said. He forced her to kneel and admitted his terror-stricken we was “screaming” and begging him not to dismember her. “As I was chopping her hands she didn’t try to run away. “She just fell down. “I dragged her to the car.

At hospital I went through security gate and screamed that they had to take her from the car. “I helped to put her on the trolley.” She earlier told how Grachyov was “totally calm” when he axed her hands. “Unfortunately, I felt all the pain very much. I was dreaming that I would faint. “I kept thinking all the time, why am I not fainting  “When he raised his axe, I just closed my eyes, I didn’t look at it….

Many passengers had already scheduled flights from Rome tohome or continue their holidays, but they fear they wonapost make it there and they will be left out of pocket. Ms Walker said passengers were told the ship had suffered an electrical problem which affected its propulsion system. Norwegian said a mechanical issue was forcing the vessel to travel at a slower speed.  Ms Walker said people were growing increasingly frustrated and angry, adding: A lot of people have been put out by this. There are a lot of Americans and some Australians onboard as well, and it’s going to cost a lot of money for the families to fly back.

A Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman told : “On July , , Norwegian Pearl, which is currently sailing a -day repositioning cruise from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean, experienced a mechanical issue which necessitates that she travel at a reduced speed.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

The lane floods, so between trying to dodge puddles, you land in dog dirt.I wish they would fix the path because a lot of people use it, some of them pensioners with or parents with prams.Celia MacFarlane, Lochgilphead.Sir,Seven out of ten people with diabetes feel overwhelmed by the demands of their condition and this signicantly affects their mental and physical health.That is why we are calling for new national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health support and to increase support available in Argyll to people living with diabetes.As part of Diabetes UK’s Diabetes Weekwe are urging people in Argyll to #SeeDiabetesDferently and back our campaign for national standards for diabetes mental health support and services.Our recently published research revealed the relentless nature of diabetes can impact people’s emotional well-being and mental health, ranging from day-to-day frustration and low mood, to specic psychological and mental health dficulties including clinical depression and anxiety.The findings, published in the report #Too often missing: Making emotional and psychological support routine in diabetes care#, show that diabetes is much more than a physical condition – and that emotional and psychological demands of living with diabetes should be recognised and support provided.Diabetes Scotland is urgently calling on the NHS to create national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health services. These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right

Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up to pound million in the Borderlands Deal.ldquoThis is an ambitious approach to cross-border working between Governments, local authorities and partners which will boost economic growth by helping existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost

said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

Itrsquos a testament to the continued interest in local heritage and tradition that it is as relevant in  as it was two centuries ago.Now in its th year, the annual Haddington Show will open its gates on Saturday to the crowds and showcase the finest producers, breeders and vendors from East Lothian.The show is a signicant event within the area, with traditional displays of animals, produce and crafts but also offering entertainment and attractions that appeal to contemporary audiences.Of course there is always the lsquoBest in Breedrsquo awards, where competition is fierce but friendly between cattle and sheep breeders, and judging is a serious affair.There are about  horse classes, from veteran riders to the horse and rider fancy dress. The number of entrants reflect the unmistakable popularity of equestrian pursuits within East Lothian.And for those who prefer more craft-based endeavours, there are numerous prizes for the craft schedules, including floristry, baking, stick dressing, photography and jam-making. Itrsquos certainly an inclusive event.Therersquos even a hugely popular vintage farm machinery section, a huge draw for farming and non-farming visitors alike and which makes an impressive vista across the showground.Butyou think itrsquos all about prize turnips and tractors, yoursquod be wrong. Such is the reputation of the Haddington Show it attracts some prestigious performers.One of the most sought-after tickets is for the remarkable pop-up opera shows: a touring version of Scottish Opera who perform in a mobile lorry, complete with seating and stage. Theyrsquoll be singing highlights from three operas during the show and tickets are on a first-come first-served basis on the day.Other notable entertainment is from the Broke FMX stunt motorbike team. Theyrsquoll be performing acrobatic stunts that will have the audience holding their breath as the UKrsquos top ranked freestyle motocross riders reach heights of  feet and jump gaps of almost  feet.For something a little less heart-stopping but no less thrilling, donrsquot miss The Drakes of Hazard. Marvel at the skill of Mark Wylie with his sheepdog and Indian runner duck display team as they navigate around obstacles, working in harmony ndash a lsquomust seersquo for the kids.And no Scottish agricultural show would be complete without a pipe band.The Haddington Show is pleased to welcome East Lothianrsquos own Haddington Pipe Band, a befitting soundtrack to this traditional event.Asall that entertainment isnrsquot enough, visitors can also sample and buy a range of locally produced goods in the East Lothian Producers Marquee. The very best produce from our area includes locally made oils, dairy goods, bread, spices and, of course, whisky!Another area not to be missed is the equally local Craft and Lestyle Marquee, where you can buy items made in East Lothian. Again, the choice is ied, definitely a lsquosomething for everyonersquo scenario and some unusual offerings like hand-knitted kidsrsquo clothing, candles, accessories madefrom feathers, tweed items and furniture ndash and thatrsquos just the edit! Allow plenty of time between the performances to browse the local marquees.The Haddington Show is a fabulous and educational day out for all ages but it doesnrsquot happen without the continued support of sponsors and traders, who also exhibit at the show.The two main sponsors for  are Greaves, West  Ayre, who have been generous sponsors since , and Lothian Broadband, who this year are also supporting the show, and both businesses will be in the sponsorsrsquo marquee by the main ring, along with many other local companies visitors are encouraged to meet the traders.No less recognition should be given to the committee who make the show possible. Throughout the year, they work tirelessly, and largely voluntary, to make the show a success. Co-ordinating the events, booking the entertainment and physically preparing the ground for the big day takes a huge effort.

It provides a superb vertical foil to the horizontal expanse of the beautul little town, or Royal Burgh of Inveraray. From the top of the tower, the views can be magnicent, sweeping from the Arrochar Alps, Beinn Ime and the Cobbler above the head of the loch, down to the Firth of Clyde and the western hills of Kintyre. From above, the shape of the geological pressures that created Scotland are laid out impressively. At the foot of the Tower, lies the th century planned Royal Burgh.Climb the Tower , look around, and down. On the way up, visit the bells themselves, fitted like a jig-saw into the space, and see the video display of the bells ringing - an almost frightening sight! On the ground floor is an exhibition of Argyll in the First World War.The Tower has a poignant history. It was conceived and built by the th Duke of Argyll, Duke Niall Diarmid, as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, in particular to the Campbells and the ldquomen of my lands. It was an act of personal piety. Ten bells were commissioned from John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. The ten were cast as a single perfectly matched suite. The Scottish Association of Change-Ringers keeps them perfectly timed, and as the second heaviest set of  bells in the UK, they are known and visited by campanologists from around the world, particularly at the bell-ringing festival . Bells traditionally have names, and these bells are named for the ancient Celtic saints who inhabited the boundaries of the Dukersquos possessions: Moluag, Columba, Mund, Brendan, Maelrubha, Blaan, Murdouch, Brigid, Molaise, and Our LadyStella Maris.The Bells were cast in . First they had to reach Inveraray. The first lorry carrying them broke down in Lancashire. Then the second lorry proved unable to climb the Rest and Be Thankful - like so many other visitors before and after. Two bells and the frame had to be dumped and rescued the next day.Then the Tower had to be built. The Duke taxed all his friends and visitors for money. The facing stone came from the quarry in Furnace during winters, the Duke himself collected rubble in his wheel-barrow for the interior of the fabric. The tower was begun in , and finished  years later in , and the bells hung. The cost was just over pound,, approximately pound million in todayrsquos money. The bells could be heard in St Catherinersquos, across the loch.Before long, the tower was struck by lightning, and with the Second World War, ringing ceased. The Tower became almost ruinous. After the war, Lady Glenkinglas founded the Friends of Inveraray Bell-Tower, and gradually restored the Tower to safety, from where the bells ring proudly today during the summer months for visiting bands.The House of Argyll traditionally belonged to the Presbyterian party, with its strong links to the Hanoverian monarchy. In the s the then Duke married an Anglican Duchess, and built the church of All Saints for the Scottish Episcopal Church. Duke Niall Diarmidrsquos spiritual le was centred here, and the holy stillness of the church reflects that tradition. In his spiritual testament, he asked for prayers each All Soulsrsquo Day for ldquoall who died in the War. A local resident who remembers him avers: lsquoFor Duke Niall, that would have included the Germansrsquo. A poignant place indeed!Visit the websiteto find out more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Royal an LochanLocated in Tighnabruaich in Argyll, The Royal an Lochan Hotel boasts stunning views of Kyles of Bute.

So much so, said the Shetland Fishermenrsquos Association, that Scottish fishing boats were getting snagged in abandoned gear.But, according to Shetland skippers, it is worse than that: as with French and Cornish scallop fishers off Normandy last summer, there has been a breakdown in communication. The conflict centres on a fishing ground between  and  miles west of Shetland.James Anderson skippers the Alison Kay, a trawler. His take is that Spaniards are moving on to his patch.He said: ldquoWersquove been fishing here for the last  years, but this year there was a line of three boats with enough nets to cover the whole area.ldquoAll in all there were  German-flagged Spanish boats with no track record of fishing here, taking up, I reckon,  square miles.ldquoIn years gone by they may have been here, but there were fewer of them and they were much further out, much deeper. Theyrsquore aggressive too, telling us: lsquoThis is the area we fish, keep clear for  days.rsquoThere was no way to very Mr Andersonrsquos account. But a trawler could not drag its nets in an area where other fishers had deployed gill nets or longlines without getting tangled. And Mr Anderson said the foreign vessels were leaving their nets behind when they went to port, Ullapool, to land their catches.He said: ldquoWersquove lost a lot of fishing because of this, and because they leave the gear we get caught in it and have to haul it up.

Some environmental groups say they pose a threat to dolphins and other sea mammals.The Shetland skippers, however, argue that the technology is effectively blocking them from what they say are traditional Scottish waters.Gordon Irvine, skipper of the Defiant, said the number of gillnetters and longliners in local waters had doubled in the past two years.He said: ldquoThe problem is their attitude. They seem to think we can just move on, but they shoot their gear wherever they like and many times it boxes us in and we have to steam clear.

A recent poll suggested support for independence would rise to  per cent in the event of a no-deal outcome.Mrs May will insist in her address that the -year-old Union is more than just a marketplace for goods but is a family of nations and a union of people.She will use it to emphasise the need to ldquostrengthen the Union, and to this end is expected to announce a snap review of how the UK Government approaches the defence of the United Kingdom part of a move to build up her legacy.The Herald has been told that Lord Dunlop, the former Scotland Office Minister, has been approached to undertake the review, which will look at whether Government structures are configured to strengthen the working of the Union.The review is regarded as being independent of government but, nonetheless, could be supported by a small team of civil servants. It is due to begin in August and be completed in the autumn with the report going to the new PM.The Cabinet had been poised to discuss the Union at its regular Tuesday meeting but this was cancelled because Mrs May was waylaid in Brussels as EU leaders discussed the appointment of jobs to the new-look Commission. It is now expected the ldquoUnion Cabinet will take place next Tuesday.It is understood that there is a growing mood within Whitehall that, particularly with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, that the Conservative Government has to do much more to strengthen the Union.Already, Scottish Conservative MPs have been pushing for more direct funding to Scotland to show voters how much the UK Government does to build and improve the nationrsquos infrastructure.

The one marked ldquoUnited Kingdom had been placed at the bottom of the pile. The new premier frowned, pulled it out and placed it right at the top.In the last few days, Mrs May has had to endure the sight of the two contenders rubbishing her approach to Brexit and dancing on the grave of her failed attempt to get Brexit through even though both of them backed her Withdrawal Agreement in the final Commons vote.Her speech on Thursday will be scanned for any nuance that can be interpreted as a put-down to one candidate or an endorsement of the other in other words, Boris for the former and Jeremy for the latter.No doubt, alarmed by the ldquodo or die rhetoric of Mr Johnson, Mrs Mayrsquos central message about strengthening the Union will be directed at her former Foreign Secretary. Watch out to seethere are any references to charging at the guns and the Valley of Death.In the last few days and, no doubt, in the next  hours before the Scottish hustings, the two would-be premiers will be busy burnishing their Unionist credentials.Just as there has been a bidding war on fiscal promises and on who can sound the hardest on a no-deal Brexit, so we can expect the two contenders to be trying to out-speak one another on who is the greater Unionist.Mr Hunt has already pronounced that he would support the Union with \"every drop of blood in my veins\". At Tuesdayrsquos Belfast hustings, when talk was of the backstop and borders, Mr Johnson declared the ldquoUnion comes first\" and was ldquoabsolutely inviolable.Both men have committed to introducing a Union Unit in No  to better co-ordinate the Unionist message across Government.With time so short before she goes, the PMrsquos attempt at legacy-building is dficultnot impossible.

Indeed, there are suggestions the Scotland Office is going to be beefed up with a couple of new ministers as part of the underpinning of the Union.The Scottish Secretary is due to appear before the committee next week when he will doubtless expand on his vision for his office which, of course, might not include him depending on who wins the Conservative crown.Other signs of strengthening the Union are the UK Governmentrsquos new hub in Edinburgh, including a dedicated room to enable the UK Cabinet to hold some of its meetings there, and a push for more direct Whitehall funding of Scottish projects in devolved areas denounced as a ldquopower-grab by Edinburgh.One Unionist project, however, is unlikely to see the light of day: Mr Johnsonrsquos idea of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.When asked about it, he insisted he was still supportive but noted diplomatically it was something for the Northern Irish Executive to take forward.

You might remember what happened: the house went up for sale in  and it looked like the estate would be broken up. The Chippendale furniture would be sold and the house emptied, and weather, vandals and entropy would be left to do the rest.:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyHowever, thatrsquos not what happened, thank God: the consortium led by the prince was successful in buying the house and, in the years since, it has spent many millions in renovating the buildings and the estate. But itrsquos the effects in the wider community that are particularly striking ndash effects Irsquove seen for myself as someone who lives nearby.Our local swimming pool was on the point of being closed for example. The Princersquos foundation renovated it and saved it. The same with our once decrepit town hall. I was there on the day it reopened and I listened to Prince Charles talk about why he got involved. Dumfries House had a special place in his affections, he told us, but he also wanted to do what he could for the people of Ayrshire.And he has. Partly, itrsquos been through some of the softer benefits Dumfries House has brought, such as a new book festival and classes for local children on food and farming. But there have been hard benefits too, such as new jobs. In fact, you may have read the testimony of some of the people whorsquove benefited in this way when The Herald featured their stories the other day.People like Graeme Bone, who took a course in one of the training centres at Dumfries House and now works on upcycling factory offcuts to make bags. ldquoItrsquos hard not to be inspired here, he said. Or Kris Muir, who used to be unemployed but is now a gardener on the estate. ldquoThis place has lted New Cumnock, he said.There are lots of other people like Mr Bone and Mr Muir in the villages around Dumfries House ndash in fact, the estate is now the second biggest employer in the county ndash and I think their stories matter because they undermine one of the traditional arguments of republicans, which is that the Royal Family costs too much. It sometimes seems like British citizens who take this viewwould apply a kind of reverse austerity to the country, stripping it of everything that glitters and leaving only the useful and the utilitarian they would reduce it all to figures that can be balanced on a spread sheet. Perhaps they could print it out and take it down the Mall in a horse and carriage and see what kind of reaction it gets.However, the truth is the Royal Family is more complicated, and wonderful, than that. I know that some royalists talk about the benefits to tourism but Irsquove never been entirely convinced by that argument ndash who can say how many visitors come because we have princesses and dukes  I would point out, instead, that the monarchy costs less than a pound per person per year, but more importantly I would point to the bag-maker Graeme Bone and the gardener Kris Muir and the thousands of others like them who live near me. Their lives have been improved by the influence of the Prince of Wales and the investment and attention he attracts.And anyway, money is never what really matters in the end is it, even with the royals  The other day, Prince William did the most extraordinary thing: he told young members of an LGBTQ group that he would be fine with any of his children being gay. It reminded me of the moment his mother put aside the prejudice of the s and shook the hand of an Aids patient without her gloves. It demonstrates, then and now, that an institution that is accused of being behind the times is often ahead of them.:Mark Smith: A new secret weapon in the fight against Scottish nationalism: the pamphlet of loveThink about this too: the Royal Family does cost a lot of money ndash in  , pound million ndash but so would the paraphernalia and pomp of its replacement: a president or head of state. And we need to think carefully about what we want to spend that kind of money on: a monarch who, in the age of populism, has an approval rating of some  per cent, or some of the alternatives Sadly, you know what they are: the Scottish nationalist in Bute House or the British nationalist whorsquos about to be in Number . Some people think those two would be value for money. I would rather spend my pound per year on something better."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-english-nationalism-demeans-our-politics","story":"English nationalism is not mentioned in Mr Smithrsquos column, but it is arguably the element which has driven Brexit and left the country in its present state of lemming-like idiocy. Is it not noticed by media commentators, because it has become so normalised and taken for granted  It does appear to be a signicant mote in Mr Smithrsquos eye and it greatly diminishes his arguments for a better style of politics.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.IT is a lovely idea that a kinder politics could flourish in Scotland rather than that which we have become accustomed to. Mark Smith points out that the remarkable victory of Ekrem Imamoglu as mayor of Istanbul was based on just such a strategy, having concluded that ldquoyou cannot fight polarising populists by being polarising.Those who have become hardened by the angry confrontation that so often accompanies exchanges over Scotlandrsquos constitutional future might think it naiumlve to imagine that we could get away from all that rancour, yet the Istanbul example shows otherwise. Turkish politics has after all suffered more than its fair share of isive and angry political struggles over the years.Personally, I believe one of the biggest turn-offs when it comes to considering future options for Scotland is the grievance-led narrative favoured by the SNP leadership. The challenge for those who value Scotlandrsquos positive place in the UK is to try to dfuse discord, and to emphasise the positives we share with family, friends, colleagues and fellow citizens across the UK. Many of the dferences that nationalists seek to exploit are short-term or exaggerated, whereas the advantages of being in the closest of possible unions have lasted over the course of many generations.Keith Howell, West Linton.RORY Stewart was right to be ldquoafraid of the word ldquolove in political discourse. All you need is love, said the Beatles, and that ended in an acid trip at Haight-Ashbury. Mark Smith seems to regard love as a political tool that might be utilised so that ldquowe might be able to take on popular movements that rely on national identity, such as Scottish nationalism. His particular brand of love does not seem to be universal. Who are ldquowe Tricky word, love. Professor William Barclay used to lecture us on prime-time telly, to the signature tune of Mendelssohnrsquos Scottish Symphony, on the dference between ldquoeros and ldquoagape . The trouble is that a lot of people who think they are in love are actually in a relationship of coercive abuse. The greatest act of love you can possibly bestow on a person about whom you are crazy, but who just isnrsquot right for you, is to let her go.Dr Hamish Maclaren, Stirling.MARK Smith comments on the positive nature of ldquolove in the political sphere. What he doesnrsquot say is the first proponent of inclusive political positivity was Alex Salmond in the  referendum, and who always referred to our big southern neighbour with complementary affection. Of course his objective was Scottish self-government and his opponent was Anglo-British nationalism, the nationalism seldom referenced in the media. The term ldquoUnionist, in the time of Brexit surely being an oxymoron, and certainly contrary to majority opinion within the Tory Party.Mr Salmond gained nothing for his positivity, being told a Scottish English border would be ldquocustom posts, barbed wire, and armed guards: contrast that with the proposed ldquoinvisible border in Ireland. Or Scotland being rebuffed on a currency union, oddly this is now cast as the ldquoSNP ditching the pound by todays British nationalists.And there is not much love coming from the Tory leadership contest. What we are told by the contestants is that Scotland will not be ldquoallowed to be independent: that while border polls in Northern Ireland are guaranteed by international treaty , that winning elections with a Scottish electorate, or gaining a majority in Scotlandrsquos parliament is not ldquoa mandate for a plebiscite.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I NOTE with wry amusement the ambitions of Jo Swinson, prospective Liberal Democrat UK Leader .Ms Swinson will have no truck with the SNP or an independence referendum she hopes for a Liberal Democrat government after Brexit. Again we read about the LibDems breaking the mould of British politics, something they have forecast every time they make a small advance. The mould of British politics was well and truly broken by the Brexit Party in this yearrsquos European election  seats, with the LibDems on . I might also point out that the Tories got four and Labour .Two things she hinted at: she is not completely against co-operation with the Tories, despite their previous alliance with that party destroying any credibility the LibDems had. And her ambition to be Prime Minister would be dunted by the fact that there is a thing called English Votes for English Laws which could debar her from any Cabinet office on that score I am constantly surprised at the survival of David Mundell. The Tories, who brushed aside the five-year Parliament plan put in by David Cameron, somehow find excuses to suit.Jim Lynch, Edinburgh EH."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-to-host-royal-garden-party-in-scotland","story":"Thousands of guests are expected to join the monarch in the grounds of the Palace of Holyroodhouse on Wednesday for the event.Attendees are chosen from a range of backgrounds for the positive impacts they have had on their communities.:Mark Smith: Irsquove seen for myself the good that the Royal Family can doThe event forms part of Holyrood week, which also includes the ancient Ceremony of the Keys and an investiture.The Queen bestowed honours on  people, includingstars of Scottish sport, charity campaigners and military veterans, during an investiture atthe Palace of Holyroodhouse on Tuesday.:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyAmong them wereformer chairwoman of Sport Scotland Louise Martin, who brought the Commonwealth Games to Glasgow in , and Scotland rugby great and MND campaigner Doddie Weir."},{"url":null,"title":"bomb-squad-called-after-suspicious-device-found-at-property-in-lewis","story":"Police Scotland confirmed anExplosive Ordnance Disposal team attended a property at Breasclete on Lewis in relation to an unidentied device found on Monday, July .The device was examined by EOD and subsequently safely disposed of during the evening of Tuesday, July A small number of people from neighbouring properties were requested to vacate as a precaution and have since been allowed toto their homes.:Island le could be transformed with first of its kind plans to boost economyChief Inspector Ian Graham said: \"These measures were put in place as a precaution and I would like to thank everyone affected for their patience and understanding.\"I am also grateful for the specialist support of the EOD and would reassure the wider community that there was no risk to the public during this enquiry.:Scottish island spaceport site suitability questioned\"I would like to thank those affected for their patience and apologise for any inconvenience to the wider community.\"A man, , was arrested on Tuesday, June  in relation to this enquiry and subsequently appeared at Stornoway Sherf Court."},{"url":null,"title":"click-here-to-read-our-fantastic-32-page-guide-to-dog-friendly-scotland-free-here","story":"Wersquore known the world over for it ndash the Scottish welcome for visitors, no matter where in the world they have come from, is legendary.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amA public consultation into plans to enhance the main entrance of St Magnus Cathedral was launched last night, Tuesday, with a meeting at the St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall.

This has been under constant review, some might say attack, since .#Commenting after the Coastguard Agency consultation meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, Thursday, on the future of emergency tug provision in the north of Scotland, Mr Carmichael said: “For the third time in nine years the Maritime Coastguard Agency is again consulting on future provision of emergency tugs and for the third time in nine years it looks like a botched job.“The consultants engaged by the MCA have been set tight and arbitrary deadlines.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

One of the new measures is a study looking at how the birds# numbers could be brought down to .SNH have committed to supporting egg oiling and corralling activities, with an expert in corralling geese to visit the county to advise farmers on how this could be used and training for egg oiling being made available.Contractors will also be funded to carry out egg oiling at specic areas next season.As mentioned, a study will also be carried out to create an Orkney-wide plan to reduce geese numbers. According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney. Working closely with the local goose management group, we have committed to measures that will help protect crops, while still maintaining the balance between conservation, farming and hunting.”News of support for these measures also followed an announcement earlier in the week that the sale of goose meat and funding have been extended in Orkney and the Western Isles, until the end of .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Service providers are notied of the visit request and receive an overview of the users condition and top tips to aid their interaction with the customer.Gavin Neate, founder and chief executive of Neatebox, said: “Our app helps disabled people to receive a better service, communicate with ease and travel with confidence. Even staff at companies with excellent customer service, like NorthLink, can struggle sometimes to know how best to support customers.We’re delighted that they have seen how the product can help both passengers and staff, and hope that other operators will follow suit.”Seumas Campbell, Serco’s customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “We use the Welcome app to make staff aware of the specic needs of their visitors in advance of their arrival. We can greet customers by name and offer them the assistance they may require. This greatly improves the confidence and interactions between customer service teams and passengers helping to build lasting relationships.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travellers.Earlier this year NorthLink implemented its new ‘Recite Me’ accessibility tool to the website to enable more people to experience the NorthLink Ferries website in a way suitable to their needs.NorthLink staff have also attended disability awareness training with Access Panel Orkney and in , NorthLink teamed up with a sign language interpreting agency to improve access and user experience for its customers with hearing dficulties.For more information Neatebox visit www.neateboxcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aim of the pilots was to reduce goose impacts by managing their numbers and by selling goose meat locally.SNH has said the studies confirmed that resident greylag goose populations can absorb substantial losses without any effect on their conservation status.The sale of the meat and funding have also been extended for the Western Isles.Sally Thomas, SNH’s Director of People  Nature, said: “Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of . The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March .

They say numbers around Shetland have doubled in the past two years, with boats working ever closer to the coastline and restricting access for other vessels - sometimes across hundreds of square miles.The situation, which is legal under EU laws, has raised concern over the increasing amount of lost gear entering the ocean, where it poses a major threat to marine wildle and can cause damage to boats.The Shetland Fishermenrsquos Associationhas reported scores of local boats hauling up fine mesh twine in their own nets, while others have had to abandon work andto port for costly repairs after entanglement. ldquoAt a time when the public is rightly concerned about the amount of plastic dumped in the sea it is particularly galling for our skippers to be forced off local fishing grounds by vessels that leave so much rubbish behind them, said Simon Collins, executive officer for the SFA. ldquoWe urge the Scottish government to regulate these vesselsrsquo access to our waters as soon as it can do so once we leave the Common Fisheries Policy, as part of the normal cycle of negotiations between coastal states. ldquoIn the meantime we need the authorities to use the powers they do have to limit the damage.Fishing is one of Shetlandrsquos key industries, worth nearly £ million a year.Gill nets and longline gear are no longer used by Scottish crews as they are considered less environmentally friendly than other methods. The local fleet - around  vessels - is made up of mainly trawlers and seine netters, with a similar number of longliners and gill-netters coming in from overseas.James Anderson, skipper of the Alison Kay, said: ldquoWersquove been fishing here for the last  years, but this year there was a line of three boats with enough nets to cover the whole area.ldquoAll in all there were  German-flagged Spanish boats with no track record of fishing here, taking up, I reckon,  square miles.ldquoIn years gone by they may have been here but there were fewer of them and they were much further out, much deeper. Theyrsquore aggressive too, telling us: lsquoThis is the area we fish, keep clear for  days.rsquoldquoWersquove lost a lot of fishing because of this, and because they leave the gear we get caught in it and have to haul it up. Itrsquos fine mesh plastic, a right mess.ldquoThe Icelandic and Norwegian governments have severely limited this type of fishing, and itrsquos about time the UK and Scottish governments did so too.Mr Collins says the situation is sparking run-ins between the fleets.Nick Underdown, from sustainable fisheries campaign group Open Seas, says conflict at sea is always ldquobad news and highlights the need for better management.He added: ldquoOur environment is the major victim, whether itrsquos ghost fishing from set nets or damage to the seabed by bottom-trawling. ldquoIt exposes the urgent need for improved management that allocates fishing opportunity preferentially to the most sustainable fishing methods. ldquoLeaving fishermen to sort things out for themselves is no way to run a sustainable fishery and unfairly penalises those who are fishing legally and following good practice.A gill net acts like a giant curtain around a huge area of the seabed, catching anything within its boundary.The nets are often left in place for up to three months, effectively fencing off huge swathes of a fishing ground.Longlining is a slow-capture form of fishing involving a single line hung with hundreds - or even thousands - of baited hooks.Without careful management the method can unintentionally capture non-target fish, seabirds and other marine le such as sharks, which are attracted to the bait.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: ldquoWe use a range of resources, including our network of coastal offices and experienced compliance officers, to manage the monitoring of vessels, and aircraft to investigate and enforce compliance.ldquoScotland continues to lead the way in protecting our marine environments and we are committed to improving monitoring and tracking technologies as outlined in the Programme for Government.ldquoIn the event of an EU exit, our relationship with fleets of dfering nationalities will be considered by negotiators.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how tackling climate change made me feel like most scottish man in world dr matt winning","story":"The Scottish Government has declared a climate emergency, but we need more action from politicians and inidualsthe war against dangerous global warming is to be won, writes Dr Matt Winning.Sound the alarm. We’ve declared a climate emergency! However, it doesn’t really feel like an emergency yet. It feels more like waiting in an emergency room which is slowly filling up with impatient in-patients.All that’s happened so far is the Scottish Government has scrapped their proposed cuts on the air departure tax. An important move, as, given limited technological options, we need to curtail increasing aviation demand. Some people are afraid of flying. I think we need to make more people afraid of flying. Perhaps glass floors or actual snakes on a plane  A first step amongst many on the path to consistent decision-making across the economy. But we now need to even the playing field by taxing aviation properly compared to other forms of travel.The Committee on Climate Change’s advice is to make the UK emissions reduction target net-zero by  and that Scotland should do it even faster, by . In typical Scottish fashion, what will spur us on is proving we can do something better than the English. The race is on. You may take our condensing boilers but you’ll never take our freedom !It may very well be rivalry that spurs us on to greatness. Like Andy Murray in the tennis, it is the achievements of those around him that made him work harder to reach the top. Glasgow and Edinburgh are now in direct competition to become the UK’s first net-zero city. Having lived in both cities, I am looking forward to a wind turbine on the top of the Duke of Wellington’s cone and tourists’ footsteps on the Royal Mile powering local homes. If we could harness the unleashed rivalry of Scottish sports fans and turn that into something positive, like ‘nine in a row’ for largest emissions reductions, then we’d sort the problem in absolutely no time. We always want to feel we’re better than our neighbours so get out there, start telling Susan next door about how little you drive and watch her sell that Volvo and become an eco-warrior.: The proof that the private sector cannot secure just transition to green economy – Richard Leonard: Scotland fails to hit climate change targets for past two years in a rowWe have done well so far, especially on decarbonising the power sector, as Scotland’s actual emissions are now half what they were in , back when coal reigned supreme and wind power was virtually non-existent. That is the easy stuff. Heating is next and I don’t knowyou’ve noticed but we are a Baltic nation, so we use an awful lot of it. I think  per cent is my gran. However, there has been very little progress in emissions reductions in transport, agriculture, forestry and land-use sectors, although some plans are now in place.We need to drive electric cars but also have more car-sharing options and to drive less. Changes in road transport will also have extra benefits, mostly health related. Firstly, it will reduce air pollution which hopefully means the only filter kids will need on their face is on Snapchat. Parents often choose quieter routes to walk with their children, away from traffic, as this can cut pollution exposure by almost two-thirds. We’re so afraid of inconveniencing drivers that the people being poisoned are the ones having to change their behaviour. If we continue with that logic we’ll soon just be telling children to stop breathing.Secondly, there’s the benefits of walking and cycling more. Run to the gym to cancel your membership. Then there is changing our diets. To cut emissions I have changed my milk. I now only drink oat milk, which is especially weird when I have it in my porridge. Oat on oat action. I feel like the most Scottish man in the world. I want my oats ground into liquid and poured over more oats. I’ve also gone from eating meat in most meals to only a couple times a week, which has been hard as I like a burger as much as the next Five Guys.In Scotland, it is quite clear that the view on the role of the oil and gas industry has changed since the independence referendum in . This industry which has given us all so much will, whether as part of the UK or not, need to be mostly dismantled over the coming decades. Here, with the current expertise, we have the opportunity to become a world leader in carbon capture and storage that will be required for hard to decarbonise sectors in industry. But it requires signicant policy support to come to fruition.It has been quite the year for climate change in Scotland. School strikes, dire climate reports, wildfires, protesters gluing themselves to buildings, and the warmest February on record. And now a climate emergency. It feels like a turning point. I started my PhD on this very topic about  years ago. Back then we were the first nation to introduce legislation on limiting our contribution to climate change. We paved the way and other countries followed suit. We now have  years to reduce global emissions by  per cent in order to stay below .C increase. It’s time for us to show the way once again and finish the job. Show them how it’s done.However, we cannot underestimate the scale of the challenge required. Achieving this is going to require everybody throwing everything at the wall. This will not be easy. Almost every aspect of society will see signicant adjustments. How you get to work, where you work, how and where you take holidays, what you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner, what you buy, and how your home is heated. People often say we could do with a war, well here it is, it’s against our carbon-intensive society.

Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid..."},{"url":null,"title":"relief cleaner at shetland cleaner services ","story":"Relief CleanerTo cover holidays and sickness periods for regular staff in the mornings from .am to .am.To apply and for further details Tel Bigton   office hours Mon to Fri, or email your name, address and phone number to: babs.shetlandcleaning@hotmail or robbie@shetlandcleaning.plus"},{"url":null,"title":"various properties at hjaltland housing ","story":"We have a one bedroom, two person, first floor flat available to rent.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ardoyne dancers top of the world","story":"AN Ardoyne-based Irish dancing school are celebrating after their success at the An Chomhdhail World Championships in Killarney.Lawrenson-Toal Academy of Irish Dance brought home a world champion to North Belfast with Caragh Hendron scooping first place in the under- category.

Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"getting to the open all you need to know","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is great sense of friendship, building bridges and sense of inclusion amongst the communities.”He concluded: “These types of projects are vital in a society to promote combined efforts for a good cause and aims which are beyond race, religion and nationality.“North West Islamic association is grateful to the participants of the challenge this year and also to the people who have donated money for this great cause this year and years before and for support in future.

Ireland to support the rights of workers to holiday back-pay.Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding that police officers and civilian staff are owed holiday pay dating back twenty years.Trade unions have argued that all workers should be included, from both the public and private sectors.There are about , public sector employees in Northern Ireland, official figures show.The public sector bill would be a huge challenge to Stormonts budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants.The British government rushed through a two-year limit on miscalculated claims but no such cap was put in place in Northern Ireland which means the costs could be astronomical.Niall McCarroll, Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Council said DTUC will be at the forefront of the biggest working-class action in a generation, demanding that any worker who has had their rightfully earned money withheld, ed immediately.This is in line with the recent Appeal Court hearing, which ruled that workers were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime, which in effect breached European law.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked, including overtime.Mr McCarroll said: “Since the Appeal Court ruling all we have heard is how much this will cost the tax payer, impacting on our ability toand indeed provide much needed already stretched public services, whilst protecting budgetary integrity.“There has been no reference to the integrity of workers who have been forced to use foodbanks, went into mortgage arrears, struggling to survive during austerity driven pay cuts, austerity, which seems to have benefitted the already wealthy whilst attacking working class communities.”Poverty payThe trade unionist questioned whether workers might have been spared such hardshipthey were given the correct holiday pay.“This shortfall in take home pay could be as much as £ a month, which is a signicant amount for any worker, especially workers within the Derry and Strabane area, who are already in receipt of poverty pay and terms and conditions which deny them a just and favourable standard of living.“For many workers this shortfall could have been the dference between being able to heat their homes and feed their families.”He added: “Of course, so called business leaders and employers have known about this additional holiday pay entitlement for some time which most chose to ignore, and indeed when challenged by the trade union movement they refused to value their employees and pay out.“The establishment in all its parts has once again been exposed in their continuous cycle of treating working class people and their families as being non-entities within society.“All elected representatives and political parties should come out now, publicly and unequivocally showing solidarity and making it clear that they support workers and their families, in their demand for equality and justice, calling for this Appeal Court ruling to be implemente“The full power and influence of the trade union movement will meet head-on any attempts to challenge this ruling and deny workers their rightful entitlement.”Political responseIn statements to the Derry News, NI’s five main political parties have gone on record as saying they believe workers should receive payments they are legally entitled to.The DUP is however mindful of implications for the public purse and Sinn Féin believes payments should be paid over a timescale which “protects the viability of public services and businesses.\"Ulster Unionist Finance Spokesperson, Steve Aiken MLA, said “urgent clarity is needed” but like other parties was concerned about “budgetary implications” for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and its associated public bodies. He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

We made three or four goal chances, we scored one and we missed a number of kickable scores and frees, Tally said.ldquoThe players, though, gave all they had and never gave up on it. Ultimately, against a team like Mayo,you are not clinical you will come up that bit short.Over in Fr Lynch Park in Ballyholland, Down camogs won a hard-hitting encounter with a talented Laois side.Down held a - to - interval lead and then withstood a concerted second half fightback from their visitors, but the Ulster champions did enough to get over the line in a robust and competitive clash.Down now entertain Carlow on July  or ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Special event marking 10th anniversary of new Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospital is  years old.A special event to mark the occasion takes place at the main foyer at the Struell Road facility this Friday at pm, with the birthday celebration attended by past and present staff.Ahead of the event, South Down MLA Colin McGrath has paid tribute to all the staff who work at the hospital and the excellent service they provide.He also described the hospitalrsquos past decade as a ldquorollercoaster which featured many highs and many lows.ldquoThe one constant has been the high quality of care offered at the Downe from a range of health care practitioners and the all-important support and wrap-round staff, said Mr McGrath.But the Assemblyman said he and many others are keen to see theof the hospitalrsquos -hour AE service and dedicated coronary care unit.He said people also have concerns about the loss of the Downersquos coffee shop, praising the the GP out-of-hours service which he believes is a model which could be successfully replicated in other areas.ldquoThis is an exemplary unit and everyone who uses it is happy, he continued. ldquoAdditional regional clinics, including ophthalmology, are now delivered in Downpatrick which has helped generate increased footfall.

Only a couple of people said the opposite, that they had been impressed by neither man.For Boris Johnson: Tory member Angela DickinsonA small number of people on both sides of the campaign, who had either said that they were supporters of Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, then said that despite that preference the other candidate had performed better yesterday.“I thought Hunt was best but I am voting Boris,” said one man.“I am a Hunt supporter but Boris spoke very well,” said another.‘A monster has been taken off the streets,’ say family of Laurence Shaw as his killer is jailed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"One couple, Adrian and Felicity Huston disagreed. “Boris was tired,” said Mrs Huston. “But Boris is the future,” said Mr Huston. For neithere: Tory member Angus CreeThis poll was a large proportion of people present yesterday, but a smallish sample of overall NI Tories, who are themselves only a tiny fraction of UK Tories, but even so the NI branch seems mostly pro Brexit and anti backstop, so it suggests respectable support for the moderate underdog Mr Hunt.• The Press Association also got quotes from departing delegates after the huntings, as follows:Gary Hynds, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland, said: “It’s going to be a very tough decision, they were both very impressive, and their commitment to the party in Northern Ireland was very welcome as well. “I thought the members will be very happy with that and people will be going home thinking a lot tonight and the days ahead in terms of who they will support. I think it is going to be closer than people maybe think.“Boris has been the front runner from the start, but Jeremy is performing very well and certainly closing the gap and it is going to be very interesting to see who wins.”Some were already clear in their mind about who they would vote for, including Frank Shivers of the North Down branch, who said it is “time for a “maverick”.For Jeremy Hunt: Tory member Rowan Wise“I was going in there voting for Boris and I have been voting for Boris for a while, but I thought that Jeremy came across very credible, a safe pair of hands,” he said.“But unfortunately in the times we are at, we have had a safe pair of hands with Theresa May who I thought was an excellent Prime Minister treated very badly by the EU, Westminster and parts of her own party.“So we need a maverick, we need someone with a bit of charisma, a bit of character and someone who is going to deliver for the people of the United Kingdom.”Angela Dickinson, from Larne, was also backing Mr Johnson.“I thought they were both good, Jeremy is very polished and I do like a lot about what he said. But from the point of view of actually taking us over the line and getting us out of the EU simply because we have got other things to do, I thought Boris did better,” she said.“I have known Boris for some time, I watched him as London mayor when I was in London and he was impressive there. He did things that other people basically couldn’t have done.“The best thing about Boris is his optimism, he always thinks we can achieve things and I feel that together we can do that.”However, Mark Hamilton, from North Down, was left less impressed by Mr Johnson.“I went in veering towards Boris, I thought I’d be convinced because he is well known for being a good speaker, but I went in and he was just another pretty normal speaker,” he said.“I though a lot of what he said had a lot of fluff in it, Jeremy Hunt set out a lot more clear plans in terms of the economy after Brexit - and I think he represents more the country I want to be in after Brexit.”Margaret McVeigh, from Belfast, said she was planning to vote for Mr Hunt.“I came with ideas about who I was going to vote for but I was prepared to change my mindmy mind could be changed by the two people speaking,” she said.“I think today I haven’t changed my mind, I am still going to vote for Jeremy. He was the better of the two speakers today, I think he answered the questions head on, he detailed about what he was planning to do in his four points and generally responded to questions, I thought, very very well.“I thought Boris, it was not his best effort, I lived in London for  years and he was a very entertaining speaker, in fact I campaigned for him when he was going for mayor of London.“But today he was just a bit too much bluster and blag for my liking.”Irwin Armstrong, former chair of the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, said there were striking dferences in the presentations.“We had the organised Jeremy Hunt and a much more off-the-cuff and unprepared Boris — which is probably what we would expect,” he said.Tony Cullon, from North Down, said Mr Johnson’s “dferent negotiating style” could deliver a Brexit breakthrough.“I like both candidates’ Brexit plan, both laid it out really clearly but, for me, I’ve always been a Boris fan,” he said.“I was a Boris fan going into this and I believe personally he’s going to be the one who can deliver Brexit on the st of October for the United Kingdom — compared to Jeremy Hunt, I think it will be Boris who will push it over the line.”Angus Cree, from Bangor, said he came into the event undecided.“And I have left undecided,” he said.“I don’t think either of them have a clear strategy on how they are going to get Brexit through because the EU won’t renegotiate and parliament say they won’t allow a no-deal. And I am worried that the Conservative Party has a pretty bleak future in a general election because they won’t be able to keep voters away from the Brexit Party.”Rowan Wise, chairman of the Queen’s University Conservative and Unionist Society, asked Mr Johnson about his relationship with the DUP during the event.Afterwards, he said: “I have always been a staunch supporter of the moderate wing of the Conservative Party, the One Nation Conservative brand, I think it is very important for Conservatives here in Northern Ireland to set their stall out as very dferent from the Democratic Unionist Party, especially on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage which I believe should be legislated for immediately at the national level.“I believe Jeremy Hunt, while he didn’t say as much, is a much more moderate candidate and does understand the concerns of people here in Northern Ireland.”For Boris Johnson: Tory member Tony Cullontry catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof.

UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme.

Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
