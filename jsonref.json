I’m so grateful that they’re giving all people a place to worship.\u0027On June 1, the first day of Pride Month, Swift took to Instagram with a lengthy post, in which she wished her fans a happy Pride Month, then took the opportunity to encourage people to write letters to their senators explaining why they should pass the Equality Act, which had already been passed by the House.She accompanied the post with an image of the letter that she had written Tennessee senator, Republican Lamar Alexander.That same night, Swift performed at an iHeart Wango Tango concert in Los Angeles while wearing a rainbow colored outfit, encouraging fans to contact their senators to appeal to them about passing the Equality Act, according to Reuters.Taylor Swift¿s Surprise Performance at Stonewall Inn (Watch) ¿ VarietyTaylor Swift Wishes NYC\u0027s Stonewall Inn \u0027Happy Pride\u0027 at Surprise Set | BillboardTaylor Swift\u0027s Pride anthem leads to \u0027influx\u0027 of GLAAD donationsTaylor Swift Makes $113,000 Donation to Tennessee LGBTQ Advocacy Group ¿ Rolling StoneGLAAD on Twitter: \u0026quotYou could be GLAAD with a limited edition sticker invoking @taylorswift13\u0027s lyrics from #YouNeedToCalmDown.

Tonight - it\u0027s the big one.\u0027All of the Spice Girls have closely documented their tour journey on their respective social media pages and kept their fans updated on what goes on behind the scenes. Before both Friday and Saturday\u0027s shows Mel B revealed that she had been getting the tube to Wembley in order to beat the traffic during rush hour, ensuring to share snaps of her journey on Instagram.Posting a snap of herself with her team on the tube, Mel joked: \u0027Getting used to the London \u0027tube\u0027 life\u0027.Spice Girls fans were holding out hope that Victoria Beckham would join the rest of the group during their last performance at Wembley Stadium after being absent for the rest of the tour due to work commitments.Speculation reached fever pitch just hours before their final concert in Wembley, as Mel C shared a cryptic throwback post adding further fuel to the fire.               Soaking it up: Meanwhile, Mel B immersed herself in the crowd at Wembley as she joined her team in front of the stage to watch Jess Glynne perform her warm up act ahead of the main eventTaking to Instagram the songstress posted a black and white of herself alongside bandmates Mel B, Geri Horner Emma Bunton and Victoria Beckham in their 90s heyday, but noted that \u0027five girls\u0027 would be headlining the stadium in London.However Victoria appeared to dash any last hopes that she will make an appearance during the last night of the tour, as she was pictured arriving at Sergio Ramos and Pilar Rubio\u0027s wedding with husband David in Seville.Earlier in the day Mel C shared a post which led to a flurry of comments from delighted fans who began to suggest that Victoria could be making a return for the final show, after pulling out of the reunion tour due to work commitments. In a lengthy caption Mel wrote: \u0027In 1994 five girls answered an advert in The Stage newspaper for a new girl band. 25 years later, those five girls headline Wembley Stadium, for the third night in a row!\u0027Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that all these years later we would be playing to sold out stadiums, performing what I believe to be the best show we’ve ever done.\u0027It’s an honour and a privilege to share a stage with my fellow Spices, @therealgerihalliwell @officialmelb @emmaleebunton and the gorgeous @victoriabeckham will always be missed (hopefully someday to return)! The singer continued: \u0027I never forget though, none of this would have been possible without you - the unbelievable fans.

Pictured: Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. In 1964, Michael Murphy told Hawkins he harnessed siddhi power to put a baseball pitcher on his backsideAlthough the claims might sound outlandish, Hawkins cites the expert opinion of a Princeton University scientist who created a crowd experiment on a pinball-type machine in 1995.Dean Readin found that at fever pitch, the crowd\u0027s chanting could \u0027affect the quantum level of reality\u0027 and have the pinballs fall in a consistent pattern out of line with pure chance.The Soviet psychic: Anatoly Karpov versus Viktor KorchnoiWhat happened...Chess grandmasters Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi battled it out at a grudge match in Baguio, the Philippines, in 1978.Korchnoi, who had been dubbed Viktor the Terrible\u0027 after he defected from the Soviet Union to Switzerland two years earlier, had earned the right to play 27-year-old Karpov for the 13th world chess championship title.The match was one of the most bizarre bouts in history, with Korchnoi being tortured by voices in his head accusing him of being a Soviet traitor.             Anatoly Karpov (pictured) pulled in the help of Soviet hypnotist Dr Vladimir Zukhar for his world chess championship match against Viktor Korchnoi in 1978Stranger still, the defector knew they were being channelled at him by a suited man in the front row.During the match, Korchnoi demanded Dr Vladimir Zukhar, the USSR\u0027s well-dressed hypnotist who was part of Karpov\u0027s team, sit at the back of the hall.Yet Korchnoi\u0027s only remedy was to stand on his head in between rounds to try and pour the vile forces from his head.While Karpov had brought his hypnotist, Korchnoi had recruited two yogis to neutralise the threat.After his loss, Korchnoi said: \u0027I expected to play one against one. Instead, the whole Red Army, led by Zukhar, was against me.\u0027What Hawkins said...Hawkins writes about the startling encounter, saying all Korchnoi could hear was \u0027YOU. MUST. LOSE\u0027, \u0027YOU. SHOULD. STOP. FIGHT. AGAINST. KARPOV\u0027, and \u0027YOU. ARE. TRAITOR. OF. SOVIET. PEOPLE\u0027.           While Karpov had brought his hypnotist, Korchnoi had recruited two yogis to neutralise the threat           Ed Hawkins - known for his football and cricket writing - has written \u0027The Men on Magic Carpets: Searching for the Superhuman Sports Star\u0027The journalist says Korchnoi knew the voice was Zukhar\u0027s but was not afraid, merely angered by the attempt to control his mind.The two reportedly maintained eye contact for a number of seconds - with Zukhar smiling - before Korchnoi lost his temper and threatens to punch him.Hawkins claims Zukhar was the KGB\u0027s \u0027mind control expert\u0027, with the ability to stop a frog\u0027s heart and working on doing to same to humans.Hawkins believes a losing Korchnoi took to doing headstands - on the advice of his religious Indian convoy - to get the negative thoughts to fall from his head.The bizarre antics apparently continued, as his mistress tickled and kicked him until one of Karpov\u0027s henchmen pinned her down.Hawkins says the chess match was a sort of training ground for psychological stunts, which were hoped to then be applied to the Cold War effort.But he adds that fortunately the powers were mainly focused on creating a super sports star, as opposed to a \u0027Dark Side\u0027 character.The Cold War race for a superman:What happened...The thoughts of Michael Murphy\u0027s hippies at the Esalen Institute had dramatic consequences on the world, with the US and Soviet Union racing to try to perfect the psychological powers.The Cold War raised American fears that the Soviets were making headway with psychological warfare and stepped up its own programme.One of the secret operations, codenamed Project Jedi, saw soldiers try to use psychological powers to spy, as well as on the battlefield.It started at the end of the 1970s to teach Special Forces operatives this new form of warfare.One of the great proponents of psychic warfare was Major General Albert Stubblebine III - and in 1983, he was at the height of his powers.          One of the great proponents of psychic warfare was Major General Albert Stubblebine III (pictured) - and in 1983, he was at the height of his powersHe was one of the US\u0027s most distinguished soldiers and chief of Army Intelligence, with 16,000 soldiers under his command.He was instrumental in the invasions of Panama and Grenada. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that Albert Stubblebine III was at the heart of the country\u0027s military machine.He was also a man who tried to walk through walls.Visitors to Stubblebine\u0027s offices at Arlington, Virginia, are told of him repeatedly walking at walls - only to bounce painfully off them.But in his mind, there was never any doubt that the ability to pass through solid objects would one day be a common tool in the intelligence-gathering arsenal.Nonetheless, he was continuously frustrated by his own lack of success.\u0027I still think it\u0027s a great idea,\u0027 says General Stubblebine. \u0027I simply kept bumping my nose. It\u0027s a disappointment - just like levitation.\u0027Stubblebine has long been fascinated by the power of the mind, and in the late Seventies was convinced that America\u0027s next war would be fought with psychic powers as well as bombs and bullets.His reasoning lay in the numerous covert psychic projects - all with bizarre names - the military had been secretly funding for decades.Joe McMoneagle was a Vietnam veteran and also Remote Viewer No1. His role was to use remote viewing to spy on Russian military bases and gather intelligence.He spent more than 20 years as a remote viewer working for U.S. intelligence at Fort Meade, Maryland, the HQ of the National Security Agency. His work eventually earned him the Legion of Merit, America\u0027s highest military non-combat medal.\u0027My success rate was around 28 per cent,\u0027 says Joe McMoneagle. \u0027That may not sound very good, but we were brought in to deal with the hopeless cases.\u0027Our information was then cross-checked with any other available intelligence to build up an overall picture. We proved to be quite useful \u0027spies\u0027.\u0027         Joe McMoneagle (pictured) was a Vietnam veteran and also Remote Viewer No1. His role was to use remote viewing to spy on Russian military bases and gather intelligenceBut the military was not content to use psychics merely to gather intelligence. They wanted to go further and use them for offensive purposes, too - an enthusiasm that turned to paranoia when the Americans learned of a huge Russian programme to develop their own psychic weapons.More than 40 Russian institutes were involved and the Americans were terrified that the Soviets would use psychics to disable their nuclear missiles.To combat the threat, American psychics were tasked with manipulating the workings of Russian computers and erasing their hard discs.They were also asked to interfere with the detonators of nuclear weapons and interrupt the guidance systems of missiles. All of this work is still highly classified.And things soon turned even more sinister - for the military began investigating whether human thought could inflict damage on living creatures. This is known as DMILS (Direct Mental Interaction with Living Systems).In the late Sixties, American scientists had discovered that focusing bitter, vindictive and negative thoughts on mould inhibited its growth. In one study, 151 of 194 samples given this treatment showed retarded growth.Other scientists found negative thoughts could also slow the growth of the food poisoning bug E.coli.The military immediately saw the implications of this work. If DMILS could be harnessed by their psychic spies, they would become the perfect assassins.       It seemed only natural for the military to turn to their most accomplished psychics for help.         Performer: Uri is well-known for his memorable spoon bending trickOne of them, a young Uri Geller, was asked to kill a pig.There was just one problem, which hadn\u0027t occurred to his handlers - Uri was a vegetarian with an abiding respect for all life.\u0027They asked me to kill the poor creature using thought alone,\u0027 Uri says. \u0027I cannot tell you how shocked I was. I love animals. My powers cannot be used to harm.\u0027In those days, I was young and naive, but in that moment I realised who I\u0027d become associated with. I catapulted myself out of that room and left the programme.\u0027Sergeant Glenn Wheaton, of Project Jedi, has said there were attempts to kill numerous animals.First they tried dogs, but the psychic soldiers couldn\u0027t bring themselves to kill them, especially when the creatures were looking at them with their big brown eyes.They finally chose goats, reasoning that no one could empathise with a creature as ugly as a goat.\u0027One of the Special Forces soldiers, Michael Echanis, could stop the heart of a goat just by thinking about it,\u0027 says Sergeant Wheaton. \u0027I watched him do it.         Face-off: George Clooney becomes a killer soldier as he stares down a goat in the film The Men Who Stare At Goats. In real life, Sergeant Glenn Wheaton, of Project Jedi, has said there were attempts to kill numerous animals. First they tried dogs, but the psychic soldiers couldn\u0027t bring themselves to kill them, especially when the creatures were looking at them with their big brown eyes. They finally chose goats, reasoning that no one could empathise with a creature as ugly as a goat\u0027Blood began to drip from its nose. Froth then started to bubble from its mouth. The creature fell onto its side, had a fit and died. I can\u0027t have taken longer than 30 seconds. It was chilling to watch.\u0027We realised soon after that everything comes with a cost. Michael suffered a sympathetic injury to his heart. Maybe it was karma.\u0027News of the military\u0027s involvement with psychic spying and Project Jedi gradually leaked out.The psychic programmes had always been controversial within the military.Many opposed them on religious grounds, branding them Satanic others saw them as deeply irrational and unbefitting of a modern military.          \u0027One of the Special Forces soldiers, Michael Echanis, could stop the heart of a goat just by thinking about it,\u0027 says Sergeant Wheaton. \u0027I watched him do it\u0027. Pictured: The 2009 movieIt was hardly surprising when General Stubblebine was quietly retired in 1984.The project was downsized and eventually transferred to the CIA before being closed down.In 1995, the Pentagon finally confirmed that they had indeed investigated paranormal phenomena \u0027in the national interest\u0027.They argued that because the Russians were using psychics, the U.S. must investigate such phenomena, too.They also appointed two external scientists to investigate the research. After more than a year of waiting, the results of this audit were released.         He added: \u0027Blood began to drip from its nose. Froth then started to bubble from its mouth. The creature fell onto its side, had a fit and died. I can\u0027t have taken longer than 30 seconds. It was chilling to watch\u0027Although the first researcher, Dr Ray Hyman, remained ambivalent, the second, Professor Jessica Utts from the University of California at Davis, concluded that psychic phenomena were indeed real.She believed the US Army had genuinely discovered a way of harnessing the paranormal.Some have claimed in recent years that the military has re-activated its psychic spying programme.What Hawkins says...Hawkins wrote about how the Soviets and Americans were both trying to create a superhero modelled on Star Wars character Luke Skywalker.He said right across the two superpowers there was a hunt for yogis, shamans and psychics to help the cause.He notes that they became Black Ops soldiers for the CIA and KGB.          Hawkins wrote about how the Soviets and Americans were both trying to create a superhero modelled on Star Wars character Luke SkywalkerThe Soviet\u0027s goal was to win the race for the perfect human, but Hawkins is open to the possibility they may have made their research up to appear strong in front of the Americans.Yet Russell Targ, who was in charge of countering the Soviet threat, told the author: \u0027They were using it to kill people.\u0027In one instance, Hawkins uses another instance of Geller, when he was apparently sent by Ronald Reagan to try to pull one over Yuli Vorontsov, Russia\u0027s first deputy minister, in 1987.         He said right across the two countries there was a hunt for yogis, shamans and psychics to help the cause. He notes that they became Black Ops soldiers for the CIA and KGBHe was tasked with getting him to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, while posing as an entertainer.Geller did his usual performance of spoon bending but made grass seeds grow in his hands in front of Vorontsov.He later stood behind the politician and said \u0027Sign, sign sign,\u0027 according to Hawkins\u0027s book.Despite this effort, the author tells how each of the countries\u0027 gurus secretly met and chose not to use their \u0027mystical powers for the Dark Side of death and destruction\u0027.They instead focused their efforts on creating the ultimate sports star.The Men On Magic Carpets: Searching For The Superhuman Sports Star by Ed Hawkins, published by Bloomsbury Sport, is available for £16.99Psychic Warriors and Project Jedi | Mysterious Universe"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/16/08/12051908-0-Tom_Inskip_pictured_with_his_wife_Lara_attending_the_Royal_weddi-a-14_1560669168397.jpg","title":"Royal christening Archie Meghan Harry return St Georges chapel baptism","story":"Keep it chic like the Duchess of Sussex in a double-breasted dress by Wales BonnerShop Wales Bonner at NET-A-PORTERThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex introduced their newborn son Archie at Windsor Castle last month, and they looked positively glowing with pride.We all remember the Jenny Packham dresses that the Duchess of Cambridge wore when leaving the hospital with each of her three children, and we\u0026#39re certainly going to remember this beautiful look on Meghan.

It is believed the bouncy castles were empty when they blew away.This latest accident follows the 2016 death of Summer Grant, seven, who was killed when a bouncy castle at a fairground in Harlow, Essex, blew away with her inside.The \u0027freak tornado\u0027 ripped through the Ashes Playing Fields in the Yorkshire town, on Sunday afternoon, as residents watched on - later describing how they had \u0027never experienced anything like that\u0027 and were \u0027stunned\u0027.                 A castle can be seen rolling along the ground as people struggle to secure it         Ambulance crews attend the scene at Howden after the strong winds caused injuriesChildren had been seen playing on the bouncy castle at the event, but were believed to have been evacuated from the inflatables before they lifted from the ground and hit nearby trees. Reacting to the incident, one person said: \u0027My son was about to go on the bouncy castle but I said no cos the rain started.\u002720 seconds later the bouncy castle was thrown into the trees.

But beyond the rainbow flag emoji, there’s one art exhibition in San Francisco that digs beneath the surface to shine light on what the curator calls: “A minority within a minority.”Opening 29 June at the San Diego Art Institute, Forging Territories: Queer Afro and Latinx Contemporary Art showcases the works of 20 regional LGBTQ artists who have been overlooked in some way or another.“It’s either overlooked or there’s some kind of tokenism, it doesn’t feel substantial,” said the curator, Rubén Esparza. “It’s essential we get our voices out there, otherwise you don’t tell the full LGBTQ story, it’s only one-sided. It’s the broader story of minorities we need to tell.”The exhibition covers three territories: social and political issues, everyday lives and identity, to find out “who we are as black and brown people”, said Esparza.It came about as an extension of the Queer Biennial, which Esparza, a Los Angeles-based Chicano artist, founded in 2012 (the biennial launches its fourth edition next summer).“I started the queer biennial because we weren’t seeing ourselves out there,” said Esparza. “Excuse my crudeness, but I just said to myself: ‘Shut the fuck up and do something about it.’ I’m not one to sit back. I’m not going to wait for someone to invite me to be a part of something. I’m going to do it myself.”The San Diego exhibit includes the works of photographer Laura Aguilar, who shows portraits of nude queer women, including herself, among nature. The artist, who passed away last year, has been noted for capturing her subjects with “frank empathy and humanism”.“She celebrates people in the margins, not polished airbrushed people we see everywhere today,” said Esparza. “It’s her and her body and her friends, not these archetypal supermodels, there’s beauty in that.”“She inspired me with her diligence and despite the fact that she could barely afford to live, she made prints, editions … she never stopped making work,” he adds.There’s also the works of performance artist and activist Patrisse Cullors, a photographer who co-founded the Black Lives Matter movement and whose photography was crucial to include, as much of LGBT art that makes its way to the mainstream is by white men. “There’s a lot of great art and stories to tell, we’re forging that territory,” said Esparza.Carlos Almaraz, a Mexican American painter who was a pioneer of the Chicano street art movement, is showing The Struggle of Mankind, a work from 1989 which shows an act of violence.There are also works by Maurice Harris, a photographer who puts black subjects alongside intricate floral arrangements. “They’re a celebration of the African American diaspora,” said Esparza. “When we see people of color in the news, there’s usually some kind of turmoil, but Maurice is countering that with these beautiful black folks in beautiful settings, an antidote to the poison out there.”Then there’s Nao Bustamante, whose work celebrates the women who fought in the Mexican Revolution from 1910 and beyond, as soldiers who fought during the civil war, as well as nurses who took care of others.“It’s celebrating the women documenting these women,” said Esparza. “It’s not really recorded and there were hard-hitting women from that time.”The exhibition opening falls on the same week as the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, where the LGBT community fought against police raids of New York City’s Stonewall Inn in 1969. However, the artists here are based in California, so there are references to historic gay activism on the west coast.That includes the Black Cat riots, where the Black Cat Tavern gay bar in Los Angeles held the country’s first gay rights protest in 1967, and the rarely remembered Cooper Do-nuts riot from 1959 in Los Angeles, where the gay and trans community rioted against police harassment at a 24-hour Cooper Do-nuts cafe.“I want to make sure we bring the whole spectrum and respect the people of color in the queer community, it’s important to have that balance,” said Esparza.“Once in a while, it’s great to bring together brown and black people where people connect and see something in each other and create great friendships. These exhibitions are builders of great community. I’m just doing my part to tell those stories and push those stories out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff70369bb34aab1825babe8f89c909c5ecc333bb/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=460d1d6cf4bf29b1d03d7e3efedbae01","title":"its not an emoji fatboy slim launches smiley exhibition","story":"Musician’s extensive collection of objects featuring the smiley face symbol to appear in showWhen is a smiley not a smiley? When it’s an emoji, according to Fatboy Slim, the DJ, musician, smiley aficionado, and now curator of a new art exhibition devoted to the iconic yellow symbol.Slim, aka Norman Cook, has amassed possibly the largest collection of smiley ephemera in the world, which is now to form the centrepiece of an exhibition, Smile High Club, opening 21 June.Items include a smiley toaster, cuff links, watches, shoes, scales, wristbands, clocks, jewellery and prints, paying tribute to Harvey Ball, who is credited for creating the logo 55 years ago, the same year Cook was born.“What I love is the classic Worcester smiley, which has certain dimensions, slightly off-centre. I don’t recognise emojis as smileys, they’re something completely different,” said Cook.Though the origins of, and copyright issues over, smilies have been the subject of debate, the smiley of which Cook is an avid fan was born in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1963, when artist Ball was commissioned by the State Mutual Life Assurance Company to make badges that would improve staff morale.“Over the years it has elevated from 200 badges made for an insurance company to this worldwide icon and this symbol of, what is for me, happiness, goofiness, stupidity and unconditional life,” said Cook.A giant smiley mural adorns the roof of his Brighton home. His single tattoo is of a Smiley face and crossbones. It became his Fatboy Slim logo, and his mantra: “Smile or die.”“The first ever 12-inch single I bought was Psycho Killer by the Talking Heads in 1977. That had a picture of a smiley T-shirt. That was the first semi-ironic use of it – it was everything that punk rock wasn’t,” he said.The symbol has been rediscovered by every generation: from corporate logo to acid house icon, inspiring artists such as Banksy in his Grin Reaper work to featuring in the noir superhero Watchmen film. “It’s a bit like the Hawaiian shirt: it’s never quite in fashion but it always comes round again,” said Cook.The exhibition, which will run at Underdogs Gallery in Lisbon from 21 June to 21 July, follows Cook’s collaboration with the Portuguese artist Vhils, real name Alexandre Farto, who owns the gallery. Those taking part include street artists The London Police the US brand imagery and advertising artist Ron English London artist and designer James Joyce and Jimmy Cauty, one half of the electronic band the KLF, whose subversive stunts included burning £1m in cash on the island of Jura in 1994.Cook said he was “like a kid in a sweetshop” curating the exhibition. “The only thing that isn’t for sale in the exhibition is my smiley collection. In it is everything from a motorcycle helmet to condoms, to a toaster, portable ashtrays, slippers, cuff links, lighters – basically anything you can stick a smiley on,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4a967a0f12b81c60bc6e6387d7d7e08436f8efe/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2da8eba80cfb0d99092372f276c245b1","title":"photoespana where glamour meets grit in pictures","story":"More than 80 exhibitions featuring work of nearly 300 photographers and visual artists comprise this year’s PhotoEspaña. The work is displayed in venues across Madrid, and in a further six cities, until 1 September PhotoEa, Madrid’s annual celebration of photography, offers an extensive programme of exhibitions to suit all tastes. The work of established figures such William Klein, Berenice Abbott, and Manuel Álvarez Bravo is on display alongside shows introducing young, emerging European photographers. The subjects of the exhibitions are equally erse, ranging from rare Soviet photobooks to snapshots bought on eBay, from collective projects decades in the making to solo undertakings completed in months.Among the many highlights is a comprehensive overview of photography projects by Stephen Shore, Josef Koudelka, Lewis Baltz, Sophie Ristelhueber and Raymond Depardon, who were officially commissioned to chart the changing landscapes of Europe from the early 1980s to the present day. Two exhibitions celebrate Donna Ferrato’s tireless work in combating domestic abuse. And the late Leila Alaoui’s sympathetic portraits of The Moroccans are displayed to sober effect at Casa Árabe.At the heart of the festival are five exhibitions of art photography, gathered under the heading deja vu because of their dependence on antecedent traditions, ideas and works, which reflect on the current nature, limits and possibilities of the medium. Elina Brotherus, for example, produces work that engages with the legacy of conceptual art of the 1960s and 70s. Clare Strand makes painted versions of tabloid photographs. Patrick Pound and Délio Jasse reinterpret archival material to radically different ends. Laura Letinsky and Sharon Core use the still life as a means of raising questions about genre, tradition and reproduction.A vibrant retrospective of the work of the US photographer William Klein presents his pictures in a display as energetic, innovative and brash as the photographs themselves. Included here are rarely seen early paintings as a student of Fernand Léger, uncompromising street photography, iconoclastic fashion work, starkly abstract scientific studies, painted contact sheets and vivid film work.For more than 10 years, Javier Vallhonrat has explored, studied and photographed the Maladeta glacier in the Pyrenees. The duration of the project, the intensity of its focus and the rigour of the fieldwork are evident in the imposing and magisterial works on show. Aerial imagery outlines the development of the Maladeta over time. And ground level pictures, assembled as collages, reveal the scarred surfaces of the glacier. Their presentation suggests tectonic plates perhaps, and the fragmentary nature of Vallhonrat’s subjectElina Brotherus exhibits a body of work that follows the protocols and strictures of conceptual artists of the 1960s and 70s, especially the Fluxus group. Her photographs are records of her staged enactments of proposals, or “scores”, issued by the group as guides for artistic practice. Self-expression, artistic freedom and autobiography are thereby reined in. Like all good conceptualists, Brotherus appears impeccably deadpan throughout, though she did confide that there was plenty of off-camera laughter between shoots.Collector Patrick Pound curates an exhibition of vintage photographs of erse subjects thematically unified by the show’s invisible focus, air. Flags, wind instruments, hot air balloons and wind-blown hair abound in a playful show that attests to Pound’s wit and imagination – and to the power of Google image searches and eBay.Offland showcases eight young European photographers, among them Eirini Vourloumis and Myrto Papadopoulos, whose work addresses, to varying degrees, themes of imagined Arcadias, refuge and identity. Papadopoulos’s understated yet compelling pictures focus on Greece’s Pomak minority and the women left behind by husbands who have emigrated to northern Europe for economic reasons. Vourloumis’s poignant series The Mermaid Madonna draws parallels between historically remote episodes of migration from Turkey to the island of Lesbos in the Aegean.Délio Jasse exhibits two bodies of work, Lost Chapter Nampula – 1963 and Nova Lisboa. Both combine documents salvaged from a Lisbon flea market with archival photographs of the family lives of Europeans in colonial Africa. Official stamps and lettering overlay and often obscure the monochromatic domestic scenarios. Jasse gives potent pictorial form to the integration of institutional forces, personal lives and colonial history"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a970cb852a9b66dda3fa061aa39ddaaa414d0b1/0_191_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e54f557885b62f5643f80843ebdec2c4","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Good news from JayZed, who has been rereading Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss:I thought I should check and see whether it really is as brilliant as I thought it was on first reading. Reader, it is. As is so often the way with rereading, I found it even more impactful second time around, and felt really quite shaken and upset as the story reached its climax.Don DeLillo’s story collection, The Angel Esmeralda has made HaveOneOnMe3 feel almost as intoxicated as a would-be Prime Minister:Nothing surprising here for those who love Uncle Don’s work, but it’s extraordinary. Every single line of his prose is like a crystal, in terms of its beauty, purity, and design perfection. Reading him almost literally makes you high, his sentences are that brilliant.Little Boy by Lawrence Ferlinghetti has swept up Eamonn Barrett:A lovely flow of consciousness from the grand old man of American poetry. It takes a little getting used to but once you surrender to it, it sweeps the reader along. Such a nice respite from the current news, that’s for sure!“What a great read,” says MsCarey, after finishing Gull by Glenn Patterson:It’s the eye-popping story of how John DeLorean (acclaimed American car engineer, experienced corporate manager, charismatic showman and hustler-in-waiting) realises his dream of making a stylish, affordable (it was to retail at $12,000) sports car for the American market.Patterson does a remarkable job of taking the mass of raw material and shaping it into a proper novel. Real life characters mix with invented characters so well that you can’t see the join… There is also no grand tone. It’s not polemical, farcical or, thank the lord, earnestly outraged. Having shaped his narrative, Patterson lets the story speak for itself and it is the reader who will feel outrage, disbelief, hilarity as she works through the novel.Children of Ruins by Adrian Tchaikovsky has pleased SackTheJuggler:The book (so far) has a similar structure as the earlier one, with separate storylines which will presumably unite at the end. In one thread, human engineers discover that the planet they have been sent to terraform is already teeming with life. In the other, a joint human-spider expedition encounters strange aliens. There’s a lot of good stuff about how the humans and spiders attempt to communicate more effectively with one another, and the difficulties of communicating at all with entirely alien species. Enjoyable “sense of wonder” SF.I know that the title is enough to put some off, but I’d highly recommend it not just as a microcosm of Soviet society, but as a wise and perceptive encapsulation of the contemporary human condition, warts and all. The protagonist, Kostoglotov, remains a hero of mine. The bravery of standing up for decency when surrounded by chicanery, deceit and toadyism strikes a particular chord in these dystopian times.“I am slowly working my way through 1491 New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus by Charles C Mann,” says BeachBumble:It’s an extremely well researched book yet written in an easily understood style. It covers all of the Americas, north, central and south, and paints a startling picture of complex highly populated nations with cities, cultures and histories at least as sophisticated as those in the old world, and their remarkable impact on their environments. Be prepared to have all your assumptions about native Indian life completely turned upside down!Finally, following last week’s discussion of Jack Kerouac and On The Road, Vicc recommends Off The Road by Carolyn Cassady, about her life with Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg:It is a fascinating book. Her writing is witty and honest. There are points where you want to shout “just leave him” but when we’re young we don’t usually have that perspective.

The 93-year-old chain Patisserie Valerie has fallen into administration after a turbulent recent few months.Patisserie Holdings, the owner of\u0026nbspPatisserie Valerie, reveals a multimillion-pound accounting black hole and said its main trading subsidiary – Stonebeach - is facing a winding up order from HMRC. Trading in the Aim-listed shares, which had valued the company at £450m, are suspended.Luke Johnson, the chairman of Patisserie Valerie, agrees to pump £20m of his own cash into the chain to keep it in business amid claims of “fraudulent activity”. Johnson, who made his name by rapidly growing the Pizza Express chain, later describes the scandal as a “nightmare” after the board said it was unaware of millions of pounds of bank loans.The finance director, Chris Marsh, resigns after being arrested and bailed by Hertfordshire police. The Serious Fraud Office confirms it had opened an investigation into an unnamed inidual.Paul May, chief executive, is replaced by turnaround specialist Steve Francis. Johnson remains in his role as chairman despite shareholder criticisms, but agrees to waive his £60,000 salary.Patisserie Valerie says it had found “thousands of false entries into the company’s ledgers”, resulting in profits “materially below” the numbers reported when the black hole was first found. Forensic accountants say they had found “very significant manipulation” of the chain’s books. Patisserie Holdings enters administration after failing to extend banking facilities with its lenders. About 70 cafes close, including the entire Druckers chain, with the loss of just over 900 jobs. reveals that Patisserie Valerie\u0027s store sales information going back to January 2013 and cash position data going back to September 2014\u0026nbspcould be unreliable, according to documents sent to potential buyers.Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct says it is making a surprise bid for Patisserie Valerie, but changes his mind two days later.Ireland\u0027s\u0026nbsp Causeway Capital Partners buys 96 Patisserie Valerie cafes and Spar operator AF Blakemore buys 21 Philpotts sandwich shops. The deals raise £13m and save 2,000 jobs.Matt Scaife, a partner at the Dublin-based Causeway Capital Partners – and the man tasked with turning round the business – said it was clear the company had been “seriously mismanaged” in the run up to its collapse.“Things had been going wrong for a considerable time and as soon as we arrived the extent of the under-investment became increasingly apparent. There were ovens that had been broken for several months, and there was a leak in the bakery roof. Suppliers were often left unpaid, while new ones were sought. Overall, it was not a good culture,” Scaife said.Scaife admitted that some of the corner-cutting reached extreme levels, including stripping butter out of key products.“When someone decides to stop using butter in the puff pastry – in a patisserie - you know that something serious has happened. At the same time there was no head of health and safety in place, which for a food business is extraordinary. It was symptomatic of what was going on across the business,” he said.Patisserie Valerie, which at one stage was valued at £450m, plunged into administration in January after it was unable to secure new bank finance. The black hole in its finances that precipitated the crisis has turned out to be at least £94m.Patisserie Valerie’s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested and bailed following the accounting scandal. The Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation but has not commented further. More than 900 staff lost their jobs in the wake of the collapse and the new company now operates 96 outlets with 2,000 staff.At its height, the chain that started life in London’s Soho in 1926, had almost 200 outlets, employing 3,000 staff around the country.Luke Johnson, Patisserie Valerie’s former executive chairman and its largest shareholder when it collapsed, has said he had no knowledge of the alleged fraud prior to October. Last week, he said he had been tricked by a fake picture of its financial health and questioned the rosy bill of health provided by auditor Grant Thornton. The chain’s collapse had shattered his self-belief and left feeling him physically ill, he said.When asked about Scaife’s claims, first made in an interview with the Sunday , Johnson declined to comment further on the basis that a criminal investigation remains ongoing.Six months on from the buyout the “new” Patisserie Valerie is looking much brighter, Scaife said on Sunday, with plans to replace the outlets’ salmon and brown colour scheme and install a smaller menu. Scaife hosted a meeting of 140 key staff last week to thank them for their hard work in helping turn round the business.“We are delighted with the progress we have made. We found a lot of problems but we also inherited some great staff who really care about what they do. There’s been a lot of hard work but it’s very much back on track,” said Scaife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1defd1391ad89d80cd6857f08f5e407b6d85f561/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c185037e04a5b401b6cfefb575f08d29","title":"last call for ppi says finance watchdog","story":"FCI launches advertising blitz to encourage applications for a refund before the August deadlineThe City regulator is launching a final call for payment protection insurance compensation, as the total paid out to consumers passes £35bn.With just over two months to go until the deadline for lodging a PPI claim the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority is launching a new advertising campaign to encourage more applications.As well as bringing back the animatronic head of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the final time, the regulator has recruited 1990s TV fitness guru Mr Motivator and blogger Skint Dad to help promote its message.The FCA said the total amount of compensation paid since January 2011 to people who were mis-sold the policies now stands at £35.3bn. In April 2019 alone, banks and other financial firms paid out £334m.PPI is Britain’s costliest consumer scandal, with banks paying out billions of pounds to compensate people who purchased often worthless insurance cover, thinking it would help them repay debts in the event of sickness or unemployment.As many as 64m PPI policies have been sold in the UK, mostly between 1990 and 2010. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the policies alongside loans, credit cards and other deals – but in many cases, exclusions meant customers could never make a claim.The final deadline for complaining about the sale of PPI is 29 August 2019. Anyone who has not complained to their provider by that date will not be able to claim money back.Banks have regularly increased the amount they have set aside to cover claims. Lloyds Banking Group has been landed with the biggest bill: to date, the scandal has cost it more than £19bn, with this set to rise further – the bank has said it expects to receive an average of 13,000 complaints a week up until the deadline.In previous FCA adverts, the model head of Schwarzenegger, mounted on tracks, was seen pursuing shoppers and urging them to stop procrastinating and make a decision about whether to put in a complaint.The regulator said that to emphasise how “pressing” the deadline was, it was launching a new series of adverts featuring the “Animatronic Arnie” head apparently being crushed in a hydraulic press.The final deadline is aimed at drawing a line under the scandal in order to rebuild public trust in financial services and reduce uncertainty for banks and other firms worried about the open-ended nature of potential PPI liabilities.Helped along by the advertising campaign, the final 10 weeks or so are expected to see a late flurry of activity as genuine claimants finally get around to submitting their complaints, while others try their luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bacc5f0b5905254e7d4fc6a57d9157774b9bfdb9/23_0_3417_2050/master/3417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6754747478db61c1a4c3a8e10c0779bd","title":"prime minister democracy dystopia","story":"Presented with Brexit, a political system apparently breaking apart and the central importance of online networks to just about everything, it is tempting to ignore the past and focus on what seems to be a very modern picture. It is always difficult to zoom out from the daily hurly-burly and understand the true nature of a crisis. But what is happening actually reflects a rule that dates back many centuries: that if an economic slump and its aftermath combine with deep social and economic disruption, people will usually start to loudly question the way they are governed – chiefly because insecurity and uncertainty always focus our minds on questions of control.Of late, when not asking members of the public about their views on the Brexit mess, I have been rereading Christopher Hill’s The World Turned Upside Down, a masterful history of the ideas and movements that cohered around the time of the English civil war. For all that it describes an exotic world of Diggers, Ranters and Familists, its story has loud echoes now: the 30 years from 1620 to 1650 described “as economically among the most terrible in English history”, with the aftershocks of the Reformation and the first stirrings of the transition from agrarian feudalism to capitalism combining to drastically undermine England’s systems of power.Not that long ago, I was immersed in the era of the Peterloo massacre and early 19th-century radicalism, when the depression that followed the Napoleonic wars, accelerated industrialisation and the rapid growth of cities caused no end of social unrest, and began the long march to universal suffrage. Two centuries on, the politics of 2019, in the UK and elsewhere, are following a comparable plotline to both those eras: a decade on from the crash of 2008, huge social and economic disruption are once again changing our sense of who we are and what we want – our work, whether we rejoice in globalisation or fear it, and our dwindling levels of faith in government. The result is rising unease and outrage about broken systems of power, and established political organisations and institutions that are ceasing to function in any credible way.A 19th-century Chartist would instantly understand one of the most blatant examples: the next prime minister being selected by 160,000 of the most unrepresentative people imaginable. Given the opportunity to meaningfully choose between an array of political parties, millions of us now jump at the chance – but our collapsing voting system still privileges two parties whose joint proportion of the popular vote peaked back in 1951. Not surprisingly, as most of us spurn any idea of loyally identifying with either the reds or blues, this iniquity feeds into the disaffection that is continuing to push Britain towards a seven-party system (Labour, Tories, Liberal Democrats, Greens, the Brexit party, the SNP and Plaid Cymru), only held in check by the miserable method by which we choose MPs.Such is the British manifestation of a turbulence breaking out across the democratic world. Its arrival here preceded the 2016 referendum, but throwing a binary question into the midst of a body politic that was already brimming with resentment and disconnection was always going to make those things even more uncontrollable. And here we are. Against a backdrop of seemingly endless change, the fact that the online world offers people at least the sensation of voice and influence is cohering into rising hostility towards the very basics of representative democracy. Feeling the resultant panic, the mainstream of the Conservative party – the Conservative party! – has now found room for the belief that if parliament proves troublesome, it should simply be suspended.Which brings us to another book: David Runciman’s recently published How Democracy Ends, which is actually a more nuanced read than its title suggests. “Representative democracy was intended to work against our cognitive biases, dimly though these might have been understood at the time,” he says. “It puts barriers in the way of immediate gratification and slows down decision-making … That’s what makes representative democracy so frustrating. It is rarely gratifying. It is not meant to be.”The question of our age, it seems to me, is whether this noble, pragmatic ideal can hold, in the face not only of how technology affects our collective thinking, but also the associated fact that so many of us now feel a deep urgency about so many different things. The urge to get Brexit “sorted” and the machinations of our newly assertive parliament verge on the antithetical. Similarly, if you are alarmed by the climate emergency, or the toxic effects of inequality, the slow pace and eternal compromises of traditional decision-making may not be to your taste.The same impatience, in fact, now runs through just about all the insurgent elements of our new politics. The Brexit party has clearly been a magnet for people full of the usual prejudices and bigotries, but go to their rallies and ask people why they have come, and you will hear a lot of loud complaints about the urgent need for systemic change. Platform speakers explicitly reject representative democracy, and Nigel Farage trashes MPs, the House of Lords and the civil service, while working behind the scenes on pushing for electoral reform – andor a system of party supporters voting for policies online, taken from the Italian Five Star movement, whose logic Farage would like to apply to the our entire system of government. Comparable things sit at the heart of Corbynism: its endless claims of a “rigged system” and the promise of activists setting policy and deselecting MPs, rooted in an agenda that first surfaced in Labour in the far-off 1980s, but is now ideally suited to the digital age (something which, when it comes to Brexit, is creating difficulties for Corbyn and his advisers, people now hoist with their own democratic petard).It may be ludicrously optimistic to suppose that the basics of representative democracy can survive the current assault, but if we are not going to head towards the kind of dystopia that now haunts not just politics but popular culture (for the details, see Russell T Davies’s excellent BBC1 series Years and Years ), great alteration is imperative. As my colleague George Monbiot wrote last week, governments are going to have to embrace such innovations as citizens’ assemblies and participatory budgeting. The case for pushing control of health, education, transport and all the rest down to the most local possible level now feels both urgent and unanswerable. In this country, we will soon have to wave goodbye to insisting that whenever a general election comes round, a population now well used to choosing from a wide array of parties should choose from a shortlist of two, or effectively throw their vote away.Anyone who aspires to power needs to understand these realities, or succumb to the fate that will meet whichever candidate for prime minister emerges from the Conservatives’ current farcical ritual – including the bundle of opportunism, vanity and nastiness who is the odds-on favourite, and has been trying to channel the chaotic public mood to his advantage for the last three years. The inevitable awaits Boris Johnson as surely it once awaited absolutist monarchs and the representatives of rotten boroughs. He will triumphantly strut around for a week or two, before standing revealed as one more hapless pretender, tossed into a ferment he will have no hope of controlling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f539b5a098190460b808d5a3e25f59789bbc5117/0_229_5129_3077/master/5129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97dda7d179d4faad72698f5528a840a6","title":"top gear brunei homophobic film stoning law andrew flintoff","story":"A segment of our new series was filmed in the sultanate. I was horrified when days later it passed this appalling lawBeing asked to present Top Gear was one of the best moments of my professional career, just behind captaining the England cricket team. I’ve always loved cars. I’ve always loved travelling the world. Top Gear lets me do both, with the added bonus of annoying Paddy McGuinness along the way.During filming for the new series we visited Ethiopia, a staggeringly beautiful country that surprised us at every turn. We’ve been to Iceland to compete in the most extreme off-road race series on the planet. And back in the spring we flew to Borneo to make a film with the Gurkhas, the British army’s elite infantry unit.Basically, the Top Gear producers came up with the idea of ordering Paddy and me to buy rare cars – on a very small budget, obviously – before dropping us deep in the Bornean jungle. Our mission? To battle through torrential rain and mudslides and deliver our purchases to a mystery car collector to see if he would add them to his exotic collection. So far, so Top Gear.So, in March, we went and shot the film. And, after battling our way to the Gurkhas’ unit base in the Brunei rainforest, we made it – with a lot of help from our team of superhuman soldiers – to the finishing line at the royal palace in Bandar Seri Begawan. Yes, the “mystery car collector” turned out to be the sultan of Brunei who, it’s fair to say, wasn’t expecting us. We certainly didn’t get a warm welcome from his armed guards when we eventually parked up outside the palace gates. But we’d completed our mission, in a Top Gear kind of a way, so thought it was job done. The Gurkhas were brilliant, and it was an honour to have worked with them.We flew home on 28 March. That date is important because when we landed we found out that – as we’d been in the air – the sultan had announced new laws making homosexuality and adultery punishable by stoning to death. We were horrified. Like millions of other people around the world, I utterly condemn Brunei’s actions. No one deserves to be stoned to death, whoever they love. Love is love.We would never have filmed in Brunei had the law been announced beforehand. Even though it has since been claimed that the laws will not be enforced, the threat still stands, and even the threat is an appalling abuse of human rights.In the past couple of months we have thought very hard about dropping the film entirely but we shot it before the change in the law, and both the Gurkhas and other Bruneians worked incredibly hard to make it happen. We don’t want all their efforts to be for nothing. So we’ve decided to go ahead and show it. Oh, and we’ve given the cars a little makeover, as you can see. We hope you like what we’ve done.• Andrew Flintoff is a Top Gear presenter and former England cricketer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de35b4fb7de02f4129f49c906334a451a85169d6/0_495_7350_4410/master/7350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1270266831fdac3cf9eb08ebbc925633","title":"the rise of the conscious consumer how to shop responsibly","story":"The way we shop is changing for the better, helped by a new breed of independent brands and carefully curated retail destinations, such as Coal Drops Yard, providing a thoughtful, ethical approach to consumptionWhen it comes to shopping, sustainability has never been more front and centre in our minds – from Adidas committing to using only recycled plastic by 2024 to Elle magazine dedicating last year’s September issue to sustainable fashion, and the ’s associate fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley stating: “I’m going to change what I wear and what I write about”. Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78937c7034dcbd181023ca914e7eeb6850bbfd4/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e1f7d8ad32b0b4caea6ab7197bd87b7","title":"horror brightburn midsommar","story":"Both Brightburn and Midsommar leave clues for fans to follow, but there’s a danger it’s leading them down a rabbit holeLooking to establish an evil horror cult? The first thing you will need is a good graphics department. It used to be that a trusty pentangle or inverted crucifix would do the trick, but in our branding-conscious age, horror movies must try harder. It seems no modern-day chiller is complete without its bespoke symbol, usually signifying an ancient secret society or some other form of unspeakable, but easily drawable, evil. Something that would look good on a T-shirt.Recent history is garlanded with examples: The Blair Witch Project’s “stick man” the similar design in Ben Wheatley’s Kill List. Sinister gave us the “Bughuul” symbol Devil’s Due the Antichrist gateway and 13 Ghosts a selection of “Black Zodiac” signs. This week, we’ve got Brightburn. This fusion of Superman and The Omen centres on a strangely powerful boy-who-fell-to-Earth called Brandon. He creates his own logo: a double diamond based on his initials. He’s so proud of it that he scribbles it in notebooks, on windows and at the scene of his crimes.We will soon have more glyphs to glean in Midsommar, Ari Aster’s much-anticipated follow-up to Hereditary. Hereditary was already a classic example of what we might call “logo horror”. It made liberal use of a curlicued symbol that resembled an ornate wall-mounted coat-rack but was actually “the sigil of Paimon” – what else? – signifying demonic cult membership. Aster is at it again with Midsommar. Set in sunny Sweden, it looks like a Wicker Man-style jaunt into folk horror. Its chief symbol, a triangle with circles at its bottom corners, will be familiar to actual Swedes: it is a pagan fertility symbol, often found atop maypoles (not to be confused with the Deathly Hallows from Harry Potter). And Midsommar’s trailers are chock-full of other mysterious runes and symbols, some Norse-looking, others possibly made up. Fans are already poring over the images. This could be a dangerous avenue to head down: where rather than being stories to move us, movies become puzzles to solve. We have already had a warning this year: Under the Silver Lake, from the director of It Follows, in which a symbol sent Andrew Garfield on a mystical goose chase. Audiences had no inclination to follow. It is fine to add a deeper layer of symbolic meaning – as Hereditary and many other movies do. But when the symbolism becomes literal and overbearing, you risk going too far down the rabbit hole. Before you know it, you could be mainlining podcasts about “Illuminati symbolism at the Met Gala” or buying brain pills on Infowars. When you’re a hammer, everything looks like a nail when you’re a conspiracy theorist, every triangle, circle and squiggle looks like evidence of a secret masterplan (that would also make a cool T-shirt).Brightburn is in UK cinemas from Wednesday 19 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb04872fcce04e6328dc7bc3a96665984a2a76d1/0_234_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3633e2e81368604564059b6d5309a1e7","title":"how the world fell under the spell of the wizard of oz","story":"The 1939 classic has inspired everyone from David Lynch to Salman Rushdie. Novelist and super-fan Luiza Sauma explores why the film’s message about home still holds such powerEighty years ago, in the summer of 1939, 16-year-old Judy Garland appeared on cinema screens as the orphan Dorothy Gale, dreaming of escape from bleak, monochrome Kansas. “Find yourself a place where you won’t get into any trouble,” her aunt beseeches, too busy for poor old Dorothy, who soon breaks into song: “Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue  And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true”. Her wish is soon granted by a tornado that carries her to the gaudy, Technicolor Land of Oz, instilling her as an icon for misfits, migrants, gay kids, dreamers – anyone who has ever wanted to run away.More than 40 years later, The Wizard of Oz was one of the first films I watched as a toddler in Rio de Janeiro, on my dad’s Super 8 projector. My parents were already dreaming of their own escape to London, where we would go a few years later. They hadn’t been born when the film was released, a few days before the start of the second world war, though by then my mother’s Jewish parents were building a life in Rio, their own Oz, far away from Poland – a land that would turn out to be far bleaker than Kansas. My grandparents were homesick, not quite settled, for the rest of their lives. Unlike Dorothy, they couldn’t click their heels together and magic themselves back. Home didn’t exist any more it was a memory, an idea, a receptacle for feelings of loss.It’s impossible to guess how many times I’ve watched The Wizard of Oz. Fifty? A hundred? When we came to London, I couldn’t speak English and had no friends, but the film kept me company along with Mary Poppins, An American in Paris, West Side Story, reruns of The Muppet Show, musical dreamworlds I could escape to whenever I wanted. But The Wizard of Oz was The One. We had it on VHS, recorded from TV, but the tape ran out of space shortly after Dorothy returns to Kansas, so it was only years later that I heard her final words: “Oh, Auntie Em – there’s no place like home!” The empty lure of escape, the fantasy of an eternal home and perfect belonging: this is what The Wizard of Oz means to me. Dorothy is an orphan, but who are her parents? In the entire film, they are not mentioned once. Perhaps it does not matter who they are. Like many fictional orphans, from Oliver Twist to Harry Potter, Dorothy is a symbol of loss and abandonment, while Kansas v Oz is the battle we all fight between reality and fantasy, home and elsewhere.Everyone has their own Oz, be it fame, money or love but for immigrants, it is usually an actual place. For my Jewish grandparents, it was anywhere but Europe for my parents, it was Europe while my siblings and I begged to go back to Brazil. For Iris Cohen, the protagonist of my second novel, Everything You Ever Wanted, Oz is the planet Nyx, a meaningful new life far from Earth from which there is no return. I didn’t realise I was writing an immigration novel until I had finished the first draft, but I knew early on that Iris was my Dorothy.In all of western cinema, is there a more recognisable image than Dorothy in her blue gingham dress, arm in arm with the Scarecrow, the Lion and the Tin Man, skipping down the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, so that the Wizard can fulfil their dreams? It’s somehow cheering that this chaotic, surreal musical about a teenage girl, her dog and her three weird friends running away from a witch, searching for a wizard, and trying to become their best selves is so influential. And surprising, too, considering that it was a troubled production and a box office flop, with a script that breaks the first rule of storytelling by having an ending that suggests it was all just a dream. (Or was it? More importantly, does it matter?) The film was based on L Frank Baum’s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but ultimately superseded it. Several directors signed up and quit in quick succession. Victor Fleming is named in the credits, but he decamped after a few months to work on Gone With the Wind, which won 10 Oscars to The Wizard of Oz’s two. But who is still watching Gone With the Wind in 2019?My novel is the latest in a long history of Oz homages, particularly in the magical, surreal and queer corners of culture. They range from Elton John’s album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road to the Coen brothers’ O Brother, Where Art Thou?, which owes as much to Oz as it does to Homer’s Odyssey. Joel Coen once said: “Every movie ever made is an attempt to remake The Wizard of Oz.” In his 1992 essay about Fleming’s film, Salman Rushdie describes it as his “very first literary influence”. It was one of Derek Jarman’s favourite movies, and among the first he ever saw. (This is the key to its influence: the fact that everyone watches it in childhood. It seeps into your unconscious and stays there.) And there are the spin-offs, sequels and prequels – The Wiz, Return to Oz, Oz the Great and Powerful, Wicked.Perhaps no other artist pays tribute to The Wizard of Oz as frequently and with as much reverence as David Lynch. His best loved works, including Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet, all follow ordinary people into strange, beguiling other worlds they contain an Oz-like mix of innocence, surreality and nightmarish darkness. Wild at Heart is a more obvious homage, with its visions of good and bad witches, and frequent mentions of the film. At one point, Laura Dern even clicks her red shoes together. Tony Kushner’s two-part play Angels in America, a hallucinatory epic about Aids, identity and alienation in 1980s New York, also alludes several times to the film. Like Dorothy, its protagonist, Prior, is a lonely young person who achieves glory through fantasy he dreams of being a prophet, just as Dorothy dreams of being a heroine. During a dream, Prior echoes her classic line: “People come and go so quickly here!” Or perhaps it isn’t a dream, and he is a prophet after all. Both Lynch and Kushner understand that the line between reality and fantasy, between Kansas and Oz, is not as impermeable as it seems. The flowers in Munchkinland might look like plastic, but Kansas is just as fake, an obvious sound stage with a painted-prairie backdrop.I recently rewatched The Wizard of Oz for the first time in years, with my baby sleeping on my lap. The film is so familiar to me that I assumed I wouldn’t find anything new, but of course I was wrong. The Wizard himself is even more clueless and narcissistic than I remembered: he is a corrupt politician, catnip for lost souls. Garland’s rendition of “Over the Rainbow” is so moving and bittersweet from the vantage point of adulthood, now that my dreams of escape – from London and from myself – have been laid to rest. The empty, snickering evil of the Wicked Witch of the West is scarier than anything I’ve seen in recent children’s films. The Wizard of Oz doesn’t sugar-coat the truth: there are monsters out there, and the only things that matter are fellowship and home, wherever you find them – a message as relevant now as it was in 1939.• Everything You Ever Wanted by Luiza Sauma is published by Viking (RRP £12.99).

An assortment of dishes served cold or at room temperature, probably made earlier in the day. Perhaps the day before, brought to the table with very little fuss. (There is little worse than a cook arriving at the table hot and hassled.) I vote for one, and only one, dish that needs last-minute work. A plate of battered courgettes brought rustling from the kitchen or a dish of prawns tossed with butter, peas and dill. Even the dessert can be made first thing in the morning, or the previous night.A plate of hot, plump prawns with melted butter and dill is a good, if rather expensive, summer lunch. I bring it down to earth with a little pasta to add body, and peas simply for their affinity with the shellfish. I suggest you ignore the large tiger prawns which are often tough and rarely sustainable, and head instead for chubby, shelled raw prawns, although I have a fancy to try this made with tiny brown shrimps, too.Serves 2-3cavatelli 250g, or other small pasta peas 150g (podded weight)raw prawns 400g large, shelledbutter 60golive oil 2 tbspdill a good handful, choppedBring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Add the pasta, cook for about nine minutes until al dente, then drain.While the pasta is cooking, roughly chop the peas. Cut the prawns in half down their backs. Melt the butter in a shallow pan, add the oil and then the prawns, letting them cook for two minutes till they curl and turn opaque.Finely chop the dill fronds. Add the chopped peas, a seasoning of salt and black pepper then continue cooking for a minute or two before adding the drained pasta and dill.A good-natured chicken salad that can be eaten hot or cold. I prefer it half an hour or so after assembly, eaten while the grains of couscous are still comfortingly warm and the chicken skin retains a little of its crispness. Whatever your timing, the watercress and pea shoots are best added just before serving, so they retain their vibrancy and freshness.This is a sound recipe for a crowd or a picnic (it travels well in a Tupperware box) and is easy to scale up or down. I have suggested a mixture of cuts but you could make it with just thighs or drumsticks if you prefer. The point is to make the most of the cheaper, more delicious brown meat and for the couscous to soak up its hot, spice-flecked roasting juices.Mix the hot and sweet paprika, ground sumac and olive oil in a large mixing bowl. Put in the chicken pieces and turn them over in the seasoned oil, evenly coating each piece, then set aside for half an hour. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Peel the shallots, halve them lengthways then add to the chicken, sprinkling with the smoked salt. Tip the chicken, shallots and their dressing into a roasting tin then roast for 1 hour, turning everything over half way through cooking, until the skin is golden and chicken cooked through.Bring the stock to the boil. Put the couscous in a heatproof bowl, pour over the chicken stock, cover with a plate and leave for 10-15 minutes until the couscous is swollen with stock. Run the tines of a fork through the couscous to fluff it up, then add to the roasting tin, picking up the roasting juices as you stir, together with the watercress, pea shoots and parsley. Tumble all the ingredients together and transfer to a large serving dish.A last-minute recipe, best finished when everyone is seated. A fritter waits for no one. They are light and have the refreshing tang of buttermilk. You could use kefir. Either are at home with a courgette. The broad beans can be cooked and crushed up to an hour or two before you intend to eat, if kept cool and covered.Serves 4broad beans 350g (shelled weight)mint leaves 15olive oil 150mlwhite wine vinegar 1 tbsplemon juice of 1 courgettes 1 large or 2 mediumbuttermilk 350mlplain flour 6 tbspoil (vegetable or groundnut) for deep fryinglemons 2, halvedBring a medium-sized saucepan of water to the boil, drop in the broad beans and cook for four or five minutes till tender, then drain and plunge into a bowl of iced water.Pop the beans from their papery skins by pressing them with your thumb and forefinger, then discard the skins.Put the beans into the bowl of a food processor with the mint, olive oil, vinegar and lemon juice, and process to a thick, smooth cream. Scrape out into a bowl using a rubber spatula, cover and set aside.Pour the buttermilk into a shallow bowl and the flour into a second one. Thinly slice the courgette into rounds no thicker than a pound coin.Warm the groundnut or vegetable oil to 180C in a deep pan. Dip the courgettes first in the buttermilk and then in the flour, then lower carefully into the hot oil. Fry till golden and crisp, turning over once or twice during the cooking.Serve, hot from the pan, with the broad bean cream and halves of lemon for squeezing.These pots of ready-dressed crab meat, one each of white and brown, are useful for crisp fish cakes studded with coriander and chilli, for thick brick-red fish soup and for sandwiches with soft bread, cucumber and deep green, ice-crisp watercress. They also make a mighty fine crab mayonnaise spiced with paprika and capers or, as I do here, with a little harissa paste. The richness of crab meat needs a fresh, light partner such as pea shoots, watercress or cucumber. The spiky leaves of wild rocket work, too.Serves 4For the harissa mayonnaiseegg yolks 2groundnut oil 200mlolive oil 100mllemon juice 3 tspharissa paste 2 tsp (to taste)For the crab brown crab meat 250gspring onions 2white crab meat 250gparsley 2 tbsp, chopped coriander 2 tbsp, choppedrocket a couple of handfulsPut the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with a pinch or two of salt flakes then slowly whisk in the oil, drop by drop at first, then a little more on each addition until all the oil has been incorporated. Finish with the lemon juice and harissa paste. The result should be citrussy with a deep underlying warmth.Stir the brown crab meat into the mayonnaise. Trim the spring onions, discarding any tough, dark green leaves. Put the white crab meat in a bowl then gently fold the chopped herbs and spring onion through it with a fork, taking care not to over-mix.Rinse the rocket leaves in iced water, shake them dry and place on a serving dish. Pile the brown crab meat on top then scatter the white crab meat over it.If you make the courgette fritters above you will only use a little of a bottle of buttermilk. The recipe that follows is the perfect way to use the rest.Buttermilk adds a smoothness and faintly tart note that isn’t achievable with yogurt. The mango needs to be perfectly ripe, and if that proves unattainable then I would use another fruit instead such as raspberries.I like the crunch of the passion fruit seeds as a contrast to the quivering softness of the panna cotta, but you could sieve the seeds out if you prefer. The shock of the sour passion fruit juice with soft warmth of cardamom and cream is well worth the four-hour wait for the dessert to set.Serves 4For the panna cottagreen cardamom pods 12double cream 350mlcaster sugar 100ggelatine 2 sheetsbuttermilk 150mlFor the fruitslarge, ripe mango 1 passion fruit 4You will need 4 small ramekins or small coffee cups.Crack open the cardamom pods and extract the seeds, then crush them to a coarse powder using a pestle and mortar. Put the cardamom in a small, non-stick saucepan with the double cream and sugar, and place over a moderate heat. Bring the cream almost to the boil, then remove from the heat, cover with a plate and leave to infuse for 30 minutes.Soak the gelatine in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes or until it has become soft. Warm the infused cream gently, stirring continuously, for two or three minutes, but on no account let it come to the boil. Lift the gelatine from the water and drop into the cream, stirring with a wooden spoon until it has dissolved, then remove from the heat.Pour the cream through a sieve suspended over a jug. Stir the buttermilk into the cream then pour into four small ramekins and refrigerate for four hours or until lightly set.Peel the mango and slice the flesh from the stone, then cut into small dice. Halve and squeeze the passion fruit, removing the seeds if you wish with the help of a tea strainer or small sieve, then add to the mango and chill thoroughly.Warm the ramekins briefly by dipping them for a few seconds in hot water, then turn out the panna cotta into small dishes and serve with the mango and passion fruit. and Observer aim to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Maurizio leaves Chelsea with thanks from us all for the work he and his assistants did.”Practicality has driven Chelsea towards Lampard, who has legendary status in the eyes of their fans as the club’s record goalscorer with 211 from 649 appearances over 13 years. They considered a move for Massimiliano Allegri only for the Italian to announce he would take a year out after leaving Juventus, and another possibility, Erik ten Hag, is expected to stay at Ajax.Lampard has come to tick a lot of boxes, not least the one about a willingness to promote academy products. He worked productively at Derby last season with Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori, who were on loan from Stamford Bridge, and it is likely the incoming Chelsea manager will also have to embrace talents such as Reece James and Tammy Abraham – together with Callum Hudson-Odoi when he recovers from achilles surgery – as the club faces a Fifa transfer ban. It was handed out in February for breaches of the rules regarding the registration of under-18 foreign players.Lampard’s lack of experience is well-documented – last season was his first as a manager – and, in other circumstances, the Chelsea hierarchy might have preferred to wait for him. Yet they know how great his impact has been at Derby, particularly on the players, who admire his professionalism and enjoy working for him. He has transformed Derby’s style and substantially reduced the average age of the team.It would be a blow for Derby to lose Lampard and they have made moves since their defeat by Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final to improve his contract. Equally, they know how difficult it would be for him to turn down Chelsea. Derby would be due around £4m in compensation for the remaining two years on Lampard’s deal.Lampard would want to bring his assistant, Jody Morris, to Stamford Bridge – Morris is a former Chelsea player and under-18s coach – and another club favourite, Petr Cech, is to be confirmed as the sporting director, a position that has needed to be filled since Michael Emenalo’s departure.Chelsea have sold Eden Hazard to Real Madrid for an initial £88.5m and they appear ready to begin serving their transfer ban this summer. Although they have appealed against the two-window sanction at the court of arbitration for sport, they have not asked for the punishment to be frozen pending the ruling.One of the requirements for a freeze is that a club shows urgency in demanding it – basically, when they take their case to Cas. Chelsea have not done so and, consequently, if they were to ask for one now, it would have less chance of being granted. Cas will not hear Chelsea’s case until after 8 August, when the transfer window closes for Premier League clubs.Chelsea said they had terminated Sarri’s contract with two years to run at the Italian’s request and at the same time Juventus announced his arrival on a three-year deal.Sarri won the Europa League and finished third in the Premier League but his relationship with a vocal section of the Chelsea support broke down over concerns about the lack of drive in his team’s style. He made it clear he wanted to return to Italy, partly for family reasons, and Juventus have agreed a compensation package with Chelsea that could be worth more than £5m.Sarri’s assistant Gianfranco Zola will also leave Chelsea. It is believed that Zola wants his next move to be into a manager’s position, rather than another assistant’s role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c514ab0cf7e9f98212e30eb7b88c81287cd95974/0_120_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=271b06cbfd7c1feda5c2b99c29427d02","title":"usa chile celebration carli lloyd world cup","story":"Carli Lloyd celebrated her goals on Sunday like she was on the links. And while her team are scary in attack the quality of their defence is still a mysteryIn a result that surprised no one, the US women’s national team punched past Chile to secure a spot in the knockout round of the Women’s World Cup. The group stage rolls on, however, and the match against Sweden will determine the USA’s path through the rest of the tournament. Now, first or second place in the group is up for grabs. Here is what we learned from the USA’s 3-0 win on Sunday over Chile.With the controversy that ensued after the USWNT exuberantly celebrated all 13 goals they scored against Thailand, the Americans were a little more low-key in their celebrations against Chile. After Carli Lloyd scored her first goal, she did her usual fist pump, but then followed it up with a polite, dainty golf clap. Lloyd wasn’t sure whose original idea it was, but Lindsey Horan told her they decided whoever scored would perform the clap. “It was fun,” Lloyd said. “I think it made a statement on the sideline.”So much for their so-called protective bubble that blocks out criticism, eh? The players clearly heard about the hoopla and set out to issue a cheeky response. “The whole team is having fun with this,” Alex Morgan said.So, the rest of the world thought Alex Morgan and her five goals against Thailand were scary? They thought Morgan being flanked by Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe was a problem? Well, how about Carli Lloyd running at goal, with Christen Press and Mallory Pugh alongside her? It’s enough to strike fear into any back line.No, the Americans didn’t manage another eye-popping score like the 13-0 against Thailand, but Lloyd \u0026amp Company pummeled a much more organized Chile side and would have had more goals if not for a standout performance from Chile goalkeeper Christiane Endler, who was named Player of the Match, despite her side losing. The American attack managed a whopping 22 shots, nine of them on target, and dominated possession.“To have the depth we have, to be able to have such rotations and still do well is really important for our longevity in the tournament,” said 20-year-old Tierna Davidson, who made her World Cup debut against Chile. “It’s hopefully going to be seven games and we can’t have every player play 90 minutes in all the games.”She may not want to be part of the second-string group that coach Jill Ellis put out against Chile, but Carli Lloyd will take any minutes she can get to prove she deserves to start.“I’m trying, you know?” Lloyd said after her brace against Chile. “I’m having fun, ultimately, going out there and showing my ability. Like I’ve said, I’m not just making this up: this is the best version I’ve been playing as in my career. Whether you put me up top, whether you put me in the midfield, I can do it.”Lloyd, who will turn 37 right after the World Cup ends, now has three goals in two games at this World Cup, and eight in her last five appearances.Lloyd has been more than upfront about her desire to be a starter for the USWNT, defiantly telling reporters last month: “I’m not here to be a super sub, plain and simple.” That’s what she is right now but that doesn’t mean she accepts it.Asked if her outspokenness puts pressure on Lloyd to perform when she does step on the field, Lloyd shifted the question over to Ellis, who has put Alex Morgan ahead of Lloyd on the depth chart. “I’ve become really fit – age isn’t a factor, my ability isn’t a factor,” she said. “I’ve been fine-tuning my finishing. So, the pressure isn’t really on me per se. I think maybe the pressure is on somebody else a little bit more.”Ellis, meanwhile, has already gone on record that she loves that Lloyd wants to start, and again on Sunday she said Lloyd’s comments are welcome. “It’s a great problem,” Ellis said. “You want to have hot forwards in tournaments, and they’re scoring goals, which is a good feeling for them, so I’m happy.”When the US routed Thailand, we said we still weren’t sure how good the American defense was. After another comfortable win, this time over Chile, there’s only more reason for concern.Officially the Americans got the clean sheet, but there was a rather nervy moment in the first half. On a free kick, goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher came out to snuff the attack from Carla Guerrero but instead missed the ball entirely, and it ended up in the back of the net. The lineswoman declared Guerrero had been offside and the goal was called back, but it was concerning for two reasons.First, Naeher either badly misjudged the ball or was avoiding contact with an opponent. Either way, she missed the ball completely. Second, if Guerrero hadn’t been called offside on the play and the ball hadn’t ended up in the goal, Naeher may have very well been called for a penalty because she took Guerrero out without getting any of the ball.It was a bad blunder from a goalkeeper about whom there are already doubts. But Naeher has been ignoring those questions and won’t stop now. “I don’t get wrapped up in that to be honest,” she said after the game. “My focus has always been on what I bring to the team, how can I help this team win right now.”The Americans did preserve their clean sheet, but defender Ali Krieger acknowledged there is work to do. “We were a bit caught off-guard from their set play – they kept stepping and dropping,” Krieger said. “We just need to clean up those little details and be prepared for anything on those set pieces. But I think we did well – they called it back and we move on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d2a7b1ebe8838a26c014e0fe89f48aa1e57f93d/0_98_5395_3236/master/5395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07681b7c857b5ad08a6426ba172c07b5","title":"five ways to cope with menstrual cramps","story":"From ginger to gentle exercise or over-the-counter painkillers, gynaecology experts advise on how to alleviate painOver-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are often enough for many women, says Dr Anita Mitra, a gynaecologist and the author of The Gynae Geek, and, as long as they are taken at the correct dosage, the two can safely be taken together. A 2012 study looking at the effect of ginger on painful menstrual cramping found that it had a statistically significant effect in relieving intensity and duration of pain. Those in the study group who took ginger powder reported less pain and severity than those in the placebo group, suggesting that it could be effective if taken at the onset of menstruation or three days beforehand.Although there is not much evidence that sex and orgasm help to manage menstrual cramps, says Overton, it is possible to feel a temporary alleviation of pain as muscles relax post-orgasm. “It is not dangerous for women to masturbate or have sex during their period, so if it makes them feel good, they should go ahead.” Mitra agrees that, for some women, this can be helpful, due to neurotransmitters that seem to distract nerve fibres involved in period pain. She adds that there is still a need to use contraception to protect against pregnancy and STIs if you are having sex during a period.“Various studies have shown that women who exercise may experience less painful periods, but it’s important to point out that these women exercised throughout the month,” says Mitra, although she says women should not feel bad about not exercising during their period if they don’t feel like it. The NHS suggests gentle exercises such as swimming, walking or cycling. Massage and relaxation techniques such as yoga or Pilates can also be helpful for managing period pain, says Overton.“Dehydration can make cramps worse, so women should ensure they drink plenty of water, and consume alcohol and caffeine in moderation,” says Overton. As well as helping with hydration, herbal tea can be beneficial. Heatcan also be effective in alleviating cramps. A warm bath or shower, or a hot-water bottle can be helpful, as can heated patches and creams to relieve muscle pain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1524e4a47b8524258b0055797bd0c808e2ad8c81/0_159_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81d6adc650f5ffb61f316065dd3690a9","title":"i was an introvert with a grey life until i learned to let go on stage","story":"The more I stayed in, the more scared I became of going out. Signing up for improv classes helped my shyness to melt awayA few years ago I watched a comedy troupe improvise an Uber journey through Nudist Narnia. I studied their joyous, earnest expressions. I took in how genuinely happy and safe they looked in their whimsy. “You joyful fools,” I thought. “Your vigour for life appals me.”Last year, my social anxiety was sky-high and my insomnia the worst it had ever been. Exhausted, I said no to every social invitation, but the more I stayed in, the more scared I became of going out. Work was stressful and adulthood felt so goal-oriented: work longer, run faster, cycle further, vegan harder.I tried meditating, but my mind wouldn’t stay still. Exercise felt like a slog. I tried colouring books, but they didn’t work. I have extreme stage fright and I am an introvert, but I was fed up with my grey life and outlook and wanted to try something radically different. I signed up for an eight-week improv course – structured but spontaneous play with total strangers. I grabbed my coat and said my prayers.On the first day, my instructor, Liam, told the class: “Improv is not about being funny. It’s not about being clever. Or quick.” Sorry, what? “It’s about being open and in the moment. Saying yes to suggestions. And going with whatever your scene partner offers you.” Liam ided us into groups of four for a game called “Remember when?” Each group had to create a story.A guy named Clover began. The two others in my group were a tall man and a woman with blue hair.“Do you remember the time we bought that jar of pickles?” asked Clover.“And it was the last jar in town,” Tall Guy said.They turned to me.“And … we buried it and swore we’d never tell anyone about it,” I blurted out. I wanted the story to be about secrets, broken loyalties and the apocalypse – when the pickle jar would save us.“But then we wanted a roast dinner,” said Blue Hair Girl.“And we wanted those pickles,” said Tall Guy.“No, no, no. We kept them buried for 20 years, remember?” I said.I came to the scene with a fully formed story in my mind and struggled to deviate. I did not want this to be about a roast dinner. Pickles don’t even belong in a roast dinner. How could I work with these people?I knew performing would be scary, but relinquishing control was the mind-screw I had not anticipated.In another scene, I was paired with a woman named Maria. “You’re in a garden centre!” Liam said. I didn’t know what to say and neither did Maria, who looked at me blankly. Then, “Look at these shrubs!” she yelled, pointing at a beanbag.“Very green!” I finally said.“What do you think this shrub is doing?” Maria asked.“I think there’s something wrong with this shrub,” Maria added, her eyes pleading with me to join in.Spontaneous. Free-flowing. Yes, and …?“Ma’am, this shrub is PREGNANT!” I shouted.Where had that come from? Free from my everyday boring self, I was discovering sides of my personality I had never known. I could feel my brain shifting as I became more creative, playful and animated.After safely delivering the shrub’s baby (7lb 6oz, the mother is doing fine, thank you for asking), I began to realise that at improv you can’t worry about work deadlines, breakups or money woes because you are constantly jumping from scene to scene. I was free from the agonising loop of being myself: introvert, anxious and shy. My anxiety evaporated in that room. My stage fright transformed into excitement, and I became dynamic, looser, more spontaneous. Happier.I had social anxiety, but in every scene, I leaped off a cliff into the unknown and my scene partners, virtual strangers, would catch me. After class, the world seemed kinder and more manageable because mistakes were so easily forgiven. My shyness slowly melted away.In one class, I laughed so hard that I cried, full-on shaking with laughter, as tears streamed down my face. My scene partner couldn’t hold it together either, and the feeling came over me suddenly. Oh, no. My vigour for life appalled me.I now regularly try to make room for improv and play time in my life. It is a bright spot when I am feeling beaten down by the everyday. The three hours of laughter do wonders for my stress levels, and afterwards I sleep without a care. I love improv, which means I have to reckon with the most hideous thought: I might actually be a joyful, whimsical fool. However, I am far too busy playing a drunk scientist off the coast of Papua New Guinea to care.• Sorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want to Come: An Introvert’s Year of Living Dangerously by Jessica Pan (Doubleday) is £12.99.

But they could be causing more harm than goodFor more than nine months, Alex Whitecross’s routine on waking was to check the data about his sleep on his fitness tracker. And then he would feel quite anxious. “I started getting paranoid about how much sleep I was getting,” he says. Whitecross, a computer-aided-design technician from south Wales, says he bought his tracker in order to measure exercise, but became interested in the sleep-monitoring function. “I’m a lighter sleeper than my fiance so I thought it would help me, but it ended up having the opposite effect.”Sometimes he would check it in the night and feel panicked about how many hours he had until his alarm would go off. In the morning, “I would wake up and look at it, and it would say I’d had five hours and 44 minutes sleep, and spent an hour and 25 minutes awake at night. It made me feel more tired, knowing how little sleep I’d got.” He noticed, as time went on, “I was getting less and less sleep as I was wearing it”. We are chronically underslept – in the UK, the average person is getting an hour less than they need – and the market has taken notice. The sleep aids market is predicted by the market-research firm Persistence to be worth $81bn (£64bn) by next year. There are a wealth of gadgets, aids and apps that claim to improve and monitor your sleep. You can buy a mattress that adjusts to your needs throughout the night, anti-snoring masks and headbands that are claimed to track your brainwaves.Alongside this booming industry is a rise in what has become known as orthosomnia, a term coined in a 2017 case report in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. The researchers chose the term, they wrote, “because the perfectionist quest to achieve perfect sleep is similar to the unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating, termed orthorexia”.Although orthosomnia is not a formal diagnosis yet, Alanna Hare, a consultant in sleep and ventilation at the Royal Brompton hospital, says it is something she is familiar with in her clinic. “I’ve seen patients coming in with their sleep trackers and telling me they have a sleep problem because their tracker tells them they’re not having enough sleep, or that all their sleep is light sleep.” When she asks how they feel, many of them say they feel fine, but they are worried about what the data from their tracker is telling them.She is seeing people, she says, “who probably didn’t have a problem until they started to become overly focused on their sleep. A hallmark of insomnia is “effortful” sleep, or trying to get to sleep, and that is what will happen if you become overly focused on getting eight hours and a particular type of sleep. It can cause a problem that was never there in the first place.”Sleep trackers can be helpful in making an effort to get a good night’s sleep, says Hare. “They can be part of a move towards appreciating how important it is to get sleep. It’s only a problem if people read more into the data than the data can give them.” And much of it depends on the personality and sleep habits of an inidual. For someone who is not getting enough sleep because they are staying up bingeing box sets rather than because they are vulnerable to sleeplessness, says Leschziner, “it’s unlikely sleep trackers will have any negative consequences. In those iniduals, it may have a beneficial effect because it highlights they are spending very little time in bed.”There have long been serious doubts about the accuracy of the data from sleep trackers, most of which rely on sensing movement, heart rate and even the sounds you make. “When we assess sleep, we do something called a polysomnogram, and that includes monitoring brainwave activity, eye movement, muscle tension, movement, breathing,” says Hare. “There’s a huge amount of data that you have to have to be able to say what sleep stage that person is in and how much sleep they have had.” Another problem with trackers is that sleep requirements are unique to each person. The “ideal” eight hours sleep a night is an average – some people will need more, some less being told you are falling short can cause anxiety. “The population level data would suggest most adults need somewhere between seven and nine hours sleep a night, on average,” says Hare. “Eight hours just happens to be in the middle. As an inidual, you need whatever sleep it takes to wake up feeling refreshed.”If you have sleep problems, or are the sort of person who might be worried your sleep isn’t as good as it should be, tracking how much you are getting can become an unhealthy fixation. “If you have a device that is telling you, rightly or wrongly, that your sleep is really bad then that is going to increase your anxiety and may well drive more chronic insomnia,” says Leschziner. “We’re seeing that, but we’re also seeing people saying: ‘My sleep tracker is telling me I’m awake at night,’ but when you talk to them, they have no recollection of being awake and they sleep well, they wake up feeling refreshed. They start becoming concerned that their sleep tracker is telling them they have been awake for half the night.”Whitecross recognises this. Seeing what his fitness tracker was telling him each morning about his supposed lack of sleep “made me feel more tired than if I’d just woken up and thought: ‘Last night was a bit restless.’” It took a couple of weeks, but once he had stopped using it, he started to sleep much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bd77583789633667b9d5f9aceb9d1200fe30780/0_3_4015_2410/master/4015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8369e47c00d82c1c1a0bbf9d71541f6c","title":"the photography of john downing","story":"The photojournalist captured award-winning images during his time as one of 64  staff photographers in the halcyon days of Fleet Street"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc7e03b68490df6acc8422afad6249dd1969201/50_554_4280_2569/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785922addb24b9493cc05c267ea3c567","title":"private armies secret deals russia putin drive into africa","story":"A cache of leaked documents appear to show how a close Putin ally is leading a push to turn Africa into a strategic hub with echoes of Soviet-era zones of influence.

It proved to be an inspired move, because the lectern answered the questions far more directly and honestly than Johnson ever would. If only the lectern had taken his place at the foreign affairs select committee, there’s a good chance Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe would have been released from her Iranian jail by now.Curiously, everyone but Jeremy Hunt chose to ignore the fact that the odds-on favourite to become the next prime minister was otherwise engaged. And he only appeared to notice about halfway through with a slightly embarrassed, ‘Where’s Boris?’ It was as if someone had shat themselves and everyone was too polite to mention it. Which, come to think of it, was more or less exactly what had happened. Still, at least it gave the others some more airtime. Not that it did many of them much good.It’s been a good 20 years or so since Michael Gove last did cocaine, but he appeared to be still suffering from the after-effects. Angry, edgy, wired and shouty. Asked to take the first question on how he would win an election against Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn he merely insisted he would win because he was the best, and became increasingly bewildered and tetchy when nobody clapped anything he said. “I’ve put everything on the line,” he later added. Under the circumstances, not the best choice of words.Things began to turn nasty when the questions turned to Brexit as Gove, Hunt, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab tried to outdo one another with how hard they were. A contest in which there was only ever going to be one winner. Raab had clearly been briefed to try to remember to smile but it wasn’t long before the anger vein on his forehead was throbbing as the steroids coursed through his veins. When Rory Stewart called him out for being deranged, it looked as if Raab was seconds away from taking an axe to him. And then taking out the entire audience. The new muscular Conservatism.“I’m an entrepreneur,” Hunt replied irrelevantly to almost every question. He didn’t look much like a businessman. With his Union Jack lapel badge he seemed more like a British Airways senior cabin steward on a long-haul flight. Javid wisely chose not to mention that he’d made a fortune as a banker selling credit default swaps in the run up to the financial crisis, but still tried to pull macho rank. He was a man who got things done even through he couldn’t point to anything he’d actually got done. Needless to say, throughout all this no one was able to explain just how they were going to deliver Brexit. So no one was the wiser about anything.About an hour in, despite the best efforts of presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy to jolly things along, the debate began to flag rather. Each candidate sobbed gently at the current state of the education, health and social care system, apparently unaware they had been responsible for their decline over the past nine years. Suddenly, the Poirot repeat on ITV3 seemed an attractive option. Thank God for the adverts, which included a trailer for Celebrity Crystal Maze. The comparisons were unmissable. A bunch of chimps would stand more chance of working as a team than the five Tories on show.Things did perk up with a leftfield question about what each man considered to be his weakness. Gove went first. “Impatience,” he snarled. Along with modesty. He was such a go-getting, high achiever that people had trouble keeping up with him.“As an entrepreneur,” sobbed Hunt. People sometimes thought he was a pushover, but actually he was a real hardman. Just ask the bloke in seat 27F who hadn’t worn his seat belt. Javid’s confession was that he should have bought the family a dog sooner. Really. Raab twitched shiftily. Now probably wasn’t the time to mention he had multiple convictions for road rage attacks.At which point, Stewart stole the show. He was frail. He was ignorant. Other people knew more than him. He sometimes changed his mind. Now it wasn’t just Raab who wanted to kill him. All the others did too. Why hadn’t they thought of talking human? The audience gave Stewart a loud round of applause. As indeed they had all night. Rory fluttered his eyelids and smiled bashfully. He’d won the debate hands down, but it would count for little. His electorate wasn’t either the audience or the viewers. It was the other Tory MPs and members and they had long since made up their mind. The lectern had it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cacff70d9fb2a4f21cac7eec330f2c4f0c85259/172_47_4703_2822/master/4703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d01cf1ca04c10787cc12d4a2135fce0","title":"who were the winners and losers of the tory leadership debate","story":"Rory Stewart and Jeremy Hunt had good nights, but the missing Boris Johnson loomed over proceedingsFive candidates minus Boris Johnson took each other on in the head-to-head debate televised debate on Channel 4. They stayed mostly civil towards each other, but Jeremy Hunt called out Johnson’s no-show and four of them ganged up on Dominic Raab over his openness to forcing through a no-deal Brexit without the permission of parliament.Overall pitch Hunt stressed that he is an entrepreneur with the negotiating skills to get a better deal with the EU.I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won’t let him out to debate with five pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues? He should be here to answer that question.Worst moment He laid on the reminders that he used to be a successful businessman a bit too thickly.Still in the race? It was a steady but not stellar performance from Hunt who is hoping to stay in second position and make the final two. He distinguished himself mostly by being the only one to call out Johnson for not turning up.Overall rating 45Overall pitch Gove presented himself as a true Brexit believer for whom getting out of the EU is personal, but he also emphasised his history of delivering difficult political goals against the odds.Worst moment Patronisingly ticking off Channel 4’s moderator Krishnan Guru-Murthy and telling him now was the time for him to listen. There were also a couple of cringeworthy lines about looking for the treasure in everyone’s hearts and wanting to make children his political priority.Still in the race? He is still in contention for second place on the shortlist opposite Johnson and he ratcheted up the passion about Brexit, but this was not a standout performance. His best moments were a fierce defence of Javid over the challenge that he was not a big enough figure to be invited to the Donald Trump state visit dinner, and an attack on Raab for suggesting he could deliver Brexit without the permission of parliament.Overall rating 35Overall pitch Javid set out the case that he is an outsider and not from central casting of the Conservative party as a working class son of a bus driver who has made it to home secretary.We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country … You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy.Worst moment He stumbled over his words on a few occasions.Still in the race? Javid gave a strong answer on the need to defeat racism and embrace modern Britain. However, he is struggling to win over MPs despite his impressive back story and it does not feel like this performance will move the dial.Overall rating 35Overall pitch Raab’s refrain is that he is the only candidate who can be trusted to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October. He said politicians need to keep their promises on Brexit and claimed to be the only one who would do so.We’ve got to show people who feel left behind that we’re on their side. This is very tangible ... I want a fairer society, not just a fairer economy.Worst moment Accusing Stewart of wanting to turn the UK into Venezuela over his citizens’ assembly idea was a low point.Still in the race? Raab spoke competently and delivered good answers on opening up education more but had no answer to how he would take the UK out of the EU with no deal without suspending parliament.Overall rating 25Overall pitch Stewart made the case that a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense and painted the other candidates as unrealistic. He also highlighted his efforts to listen to what people in the country during his walking tours of Britain as part of the leadership contest.The fundamental issue here is there is a competition of machismo. Everyone is saying ‘I’m tougher’. Every time I have this debate everyone is like, ‘trust me, I’m the guy, I can defeat the impossible odds’. And I’m accused of being a defeatist by trying to be realistic. It reminds me of trying to cram a whole series of rubbish bags into the rubbish bin … I was tempted to say believe in the bin, believe in Britain. It’s nonsense.Worst moment He repeatedly urged Guru-Murthy and others to let him finish speaking, sounding petulant and wasting valuable debating time.Still in the race? Stewart is not expected to soar past the others into second place to take on Johnson. However, he had the best lines and gave the best challenge, grilling Raab on what the tariff on cheddar would be under a no-deal Brexit. Even though he is unlikely to make the cut, he was the most articulate of the five and got a lot of audience appreciation.Overall rating 55"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7bc00c363b545a490ae7a33839f622d2af83063/0_172_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d64e891a92fbeb104c0de7d71b0dfa7","title":"can you solve it are you in the smartest 1 per cent of 13 year olds","story":"The test given to the UK’s maths prodigiesToday you are pitting yourselves against the best 13-year-old mathematicians in the UK.The questions below are taken from last week’s Junior Mathematical Olympiad, a competition aimed at children up to Year 8 (in England) who score in roughly the top half per cent of mathematical ability.The competition is a two hour paper, split into two sections.

We help them rebuild their lives “Somebody being shot in front of you, or you yourself shooting somebody, became just like drinking a glass of water.” An interview with a child soldier from Sierra Leone I read recently really struck a chord with me, because it’s the same sort of impact I see working with young people caught up in county lines. Exploitation normalises violence. Young lives are scarred.County lines describes when gangs from cities expand drug networks to other areas of the country, typically using dedicated mobile phone lines to supply drugs.I manage a team of young persons substance misuse workers and am an experienced safeguarding lead. My team work alongside schools, social workers, mental health services and the police to support young people exploited through county lines. I’ve worked in the drug and alcohol sector for 20 years. No one gets into this kind of work because it’s easy, and I’ve had my fair share of ups and downs, but I’ve never experienced anything quite like this it traumatises the young people involved.Operations in major cities seek new markets outside urban hubs for their drugs, primarily crack cocaine and heroin. The expansion of their networks into the regions often comes with exploitation.Children and vulnerable adults are often coerced into ferrying and stashing the drugs. They can be homeless or missing people, addicts, people living in care, trapped in poverty, or suffering from mental illness or learning difficulties.\u0026nbspEven older and physically infirm people have been targeted and officers have observed a gang member attending drug rehab to find potential runners.\u0026nbspInitially they can be lured in with money, gifts and the prospect of status. But this can quickly turn into the use of violence, sometimes sexual.Children without criminal records - known in the trade as clean skins - are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives.\u0026nbspCharity The Children\u0027s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines.\u0026nbspThe Children\u0027s Commissioner estimates at least 46,000 children in England are caught up in gangs.Google “county lines” and you’ll see endless news stories about arrests and drug seizures. While it’s important the adults involved are brought to justice, the message that the “war on county lines” is being won misses the bigger picture. It’s more than just a criminal issue. Behind the headlines adults are exploiting children on a mass scale. It’s too easy to forget that we’re talking about kids: it’s child abuse, and the language we use needs to reflect this.My team is working with a group of boys in their early teens who were groomed into joining a county lines gang. People assume they must be from broken homes but many have had very normal childhoods in the countryside.The boys were hanging out at a skatepark when a man asked if they wanted to have a smoke in his flat and play computer games. He later introduced them to other men who gave them free cannabis, takeaway food, trainers, tracksuits and hoodies. It was as though Christmas had come early. After around six months, the men started to ask them for favours, such as dropping off packages at certain addresses.Eventually, the young people were given a substantial amount of cannabis and told to sell it to other teens. The men took advantage of them by showing them a life of luxury they’d never seen before. They were promised the best clothes and cars, but, above all, that people would respect them. These boys were only 13 years old.To achieve this dream, they were told they had to start selling class A substances such as crack and heroin. The men brainwashed them that the vulnerable people who use these drugs weren’t human because “they are ruining your town and don’t deserve any respect”.Young people have told my team how they’ve committed horrific acts of violence against these people, who are members of the community they grew up in. Taken out of context, you would think these teenagers were monsters. But it is important to realise the extent to which they’ve been coerced and desensitised to the feelings of others. Like a child soldier, they’ve seen things a child should never see.When young people feel vulnerable they look to adults who they trust for support. But the men who promised them the world turn their backs on them when the authorities get involved. Services like mine pick up the pieces, offering them the emotional connection they need to rebuild that sense of trust and belonging.Recently one young person asked his key worker what they used to do when they were 16. My colleague described a normal teenage life of going to college, socialising with friends and making a fool of themselves at parties. The young person was shocked, admitting he’d only been to a party once when he was allowed to “knock off early” as he’d shifted all his “gear”.These children are often excluded from school and miss the milestones most of us take for granted. They have never experienced the nerves of the first day in college, the joy of finishing exams or the freedom of independence.Research by the Children’s Society found young people who are criminally exploited frequently experience emotional and psychological trauma, often due to violence they’ve seen and been forced to commit. It’s therefore no wonder that many of the young people my team work with are showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. One boy who’s soon to turn 18 said: “I can’t be around normal people because if they say the wrong thing I may end up in a fight. I’m not like other people.”As they get older, many of the young people exploited though county lines will become involved with the criminal justice system. Once they slip into adulthood, this can often mean prison.But sentencing someone brands them a criminal it’s the ultimate judgment, blaming them rather than the adults pulling the strings. That’s why in the service I run we’ve banned the term county lines. Instead, we refer to it solely as exploitation. Obviously these young people are involved in crime, but they’re also very much the victims of crime. They need to be listened to without judgment. They need a way back, rather than a locked door.• Sonya Jones is a service manager and safeguarding lead at Young Addaction, which offers advice via www.addaction.org.ukwebchat"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/491d7120b70db65fe5183ba66459862addea6485/96_23_3140_1884/master/3140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=560707fe1420d555432aab44d7a1dbe9","title":"andy murray back in love with tennis queens","story":"• ‘The reason you do it is because it is fun’• Admits that after earlier surgery he wanted to retireAndy Murray made it eloquently clear on the eve of his third comeback that his expectations have shifted from an all-out quest for victory – the hunger that broke his body – to enjoying tennis for the simple pleasure of hitting a ball.Four months after a second operation on his troublesome hip, the former world No 1 (now 215) returns in the Fever-Tree Championships here in doubles on Wednesday with Feliciano López against the best combination in the game, Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah.Murray, who turned 32 last month, said on Sunday there was a moment recently that rekindled his love of the game he has played since he was young and how he was reminded he might never again reach the level that delivered him three slam titles and two Olympic gold medals.“I hit some balls with some kids a few weeks ago,” he said. “I was practising on the court next to them. Seeing young kids running around and hitting tennis balls, just loving practising and playing, it makes you remember that is how you started – and the reason why you do it is because it is fun and you love it and it becomes a passion.“Yes, everyone wants to do well in their job but, ultimately, all you can do is do your best – and my best now might not be what it was when I was 25, in terms of what that looks like on a court. Who knows? Maybe it will be in a few months. Right now it certainly isn’t, so I can’t be expecting to put in that kind of performance.”Murray admitted: “There were a number of times over the last 18 months that I did want to stop. I didn’t want to play any more. I was getting no enjoyment out of tennis at all, whether that be training, practice, winning matches. I wasn’t really bothered because it wasn’t fun. Now it is nice. I just like playing.”López, who won the 2016 French Open doubles title with Marc López and was the singles champion here two years ago, said: “As soon as you hit a few balls with him, you realise that he still has the feeling, the touch. You don’t lose these abilities from one day to another. He is one of the greatest players ever and he is still playing great.”Murray said this comeback felt like the first, six years ago after minor back surgery, but different from his aborted attempt when he rushed his return after his first major hip operation in 2018.“When you get on the court, there is a risk of something happening. I have a metal hip now, so people may worry about that there are things that could go wrong. But I’m in pretty good shape, I’m healthy and I’ve trained loads. I have done a bunch of rehab. We’ll see how it goes.”Kyle Edmund, meanwhile, returns to the court after a much shorter break, against the top seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and the British No 1, still handling a chronic knee injury, says he has nothing to lose.“Obviously it’s tough,” he said of the prospect of playing for the first time against the world No 6 who a fortnight ago took an in-form Stan Wawrinka to five sets in the fourth round of the French Open. “He’s played very well, won a lot this year. But at the same time it’s almost an ideal situation, where there’s no pressure on me to do well. It’s almost everything is on him.”Edmund has not played since the recurrence of a knee injury forced him to quit in the third set against Pablo Cuevas in the second round at Roland Garros nearly three weeks ago.Tsitsipas is taking nothing for granted. “It can take quite a while to adjust to new conditions, which I haven’t played on for a year now,” he said. “So I think we’re pretty equal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25240a5dd7e704b1bd52b0fa33c9f2585b6b7546/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00387f314533905310385ba85b98dda6","title":"india pakistan old trafford atmosphere world cup","story":"Rival supporters did not let the rain detract from an occasion one called ‘more important than winning the World Cup final’The English weather has been a most unwelcome guest at this Cricket World Cup. But try as it might – and there were downpours and drizzle, as well as mist and mizzle at Old Trafford – it was unable to stop India emphatically proving their superiority over Pakistan in a match loudly billed as the most watched cricket game in history.As India finally confirmed their victory by 89 runs by the Byzantine Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method in the early evening gloom, one fan was beaming more than most. “I’ve paid the equivalent of £4,000 to come to England for a week for this one match, so I am so thankful the rain didn’t ruin it,” said Tarum Babhala, a furniture seller from Delhi. “This is more important than winning the World Cup final, because India versus Pakistan is such an epic rivalry.”Thousands of other second- and third-generation British Asians, who greeted every run by waving flags, thumping their drums and blasting their vuvuzelas, appeared to agree.

And after a week where a record four matches were abandoned due to the wettest June on record it provided a much needed jolt of adrenaline.Even at 8.30am, two hours before the first ball was bowled, the streets around the Manchester ground had turned into a fiesta of colour and noise. Almost everyone was draped in avocado green or sapphire blue. One Pakistan fan even came on a white horse. But there would be no riding to his side’s rescue later in the day.Among the Pakistan fans was Chaudhry Abdul Jalil, famously known as Chacha Cricket, the bearded mascot who has supported his country for 50 years. He predicted a party – and then a dazzling victory. “I was with Pakistan and India supporters on Saturday night and came together with not a wrong turn,” he told the . “India have beaten us for six matches in the World Cup but this time it will be different.”Organisers had taken precautions, beefing up the security. Yet it was not needed as Pakistan and India fans sat and sang as neighbours, side by side. “It is always electric when the two teams meet,” said Qamar Ahmed, who had travelled from Essex with his 12-year-old son Momin. “Of course there is rivalry but cricket brings our two countries together. It is a shame India and Pakistan don’t play each other more often. There should be a cricket diplomacy.”Some supporters came just to inhale the atmosphere. More than an hour after play had started organisers confirmed there were still more than a thousand people outside Old Trafford. Some were trying to sneak past the security guards. But most just wanted a small part in a shared communal experience.If Pakistan needed any more encouragement, it arrived just before play in a barrage of tweets from their president, Imran Khan. His personal five-point plan to defeat India included winning the toss and batting, and banishing all negative thoughts. “Fear of losing leads to a negative and defensive strategy and crucially mistakes by opponents are not pounced upon,” the man who had won the World Cup in 1992 told his 9.77m followers. “Just give your best and fight till the last ball. Then accept whatever the result like true sportsmen. The nation’s prayers are with all of you.”India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, appeared to have his mind on other things, namely world yoga day. But soon his team had Pakistan in the cricket equivalent of the scorpion pose as the opener Rohit Sharma smashed three sixes and 14 fours in scoring 140 runs off 113 balls.While Sharma’s bat became an instrument of torture, the Indian captain, Virat Kohli, preferred to accumulate his runs by stealth until accelerating to score a valuable 77 as India finished their 50 overs on 336 for five, their highest one-day score in England.Pakistan have a deserved reputation for being the most unpredictable team in world cricket. Yet after 25 overs they had steadily moved to 126 for two and could at least think about a shock win. However the omnipresent threat of showers meant they had to keep an eye not only on the scoreboard but on their calculators, too. The DLS method, used to adjust targets in rain-affected matches, was in play and Pakistan were behind the over rate.That meant they needed to accelerate their run rate – and fast – by smashing boundaries. But in going for glory they went down in flames, losing three wickets in 18 balls before rain stopped play at 166 for six.It was not all of their own making. Indian genius played a part. The Pakistan batsman Babar Azam had looked dangerous, moving swiftly to 48 off 57 deliveries. But as he made to accelerate he was bamboozled by a sharply spinning delivery from Kuldeep Yadav that bowled him through the gate. Unsurprisingly it was immediately hailed as the “ball of the tournament”.Pakistan knew their fate after that, although the weather meant it was a slow and prolonged death. When the game finally finished just before 7.30pm Indian fans were dancing on their seats and in the aisles, delighted at having thwarted the old enemy again. The Pakistani flags, meanwhile, were drooped at half mast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa4dafe9669e5625540d08fe7426ffe5d7c93d91/0_156_3822_2293/master/3822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eed6a7420387371afc6b009bffdddfe","title":"woodland holds off rose and koepka to win us open","story":"The finest tribute payable to Gary Woodland for this, his maiden major triumph, lies in the identity of the inidual he held off.As Brooks Koepka stalked to within one stroke of Woodland, through various stages of this US Open’s closing round, the outcome appeared a formality. Koepka, such a specialist in this major championship domain, was on the verge of history in seeking to become only the second man to win three US Opens in succession.Not only did Woodland refuse to wilt he took this title by three shots. It was impressive to see Koepka, denied his fifth major win in nine starts, amongst those waiting by the 72nd green to offer congratulations to the new champion. This was fully justified the level of calmness as displayed by Woodland under intense pressure was quite terrific.Every major winner has moments. Woodland had three. He diced with danger when aiming for the par five 14th green from 263 yards. Woodland’s three-wood approach seemed destined for trouble but instead bounced favourably from the top of a bunker protecting the front of the green. A crucial birdie followed. At the 17th, Woodland played a quite superb chip over a ridge to 2ft. On the last, the 35-year-old converted a birdie putt from 30ft. Short game, for so long a Woodland weakness, proved a Pebble Beach strength.Woodland’s 69 meant a 13 under par aggregate he thereby becomes the eighth first time major winner in the last 11 US Opens. Given personal heartache of his recent past, Woodland was understandably emotional before signing his card. “I never really thought the tournament was over so the emotion all came out when that final putt fell in,” Woodland said. “It’s so special to do it here at Pebble Beach. I played to win.” He didn’t half.Before a final-round ball was struck, Koepka may well have taken a 68 for 10 under par. When four-under through his first five holes, the Floridian looked poised for the first straight US Open three-timer since Willie Anderson in 1905. Instead, Koepka covered his next 13 in plus one.“I played great, nothing I could do,” Koepka said. “Gary played a great four days. That’s what you’ve got to do if you want to win a US Open and hats off to him. He deserves it, he’s worked hard and I’m happy for him.”There was a theory Justin Rose’s level of scrambling, as kept him prominent after 54 holes, couldn’t continue. And so it proved the Englishman’s 74 slid him back to seven under and a tie for third with Xander Schauffele, Jon Rahm and Chez Reavie.“It doesn’t hurt,” Rose insisted. “You reflect and think ‘How can I get better?’ There’s no point in letting it hurt too much. It hurts if you lose at the death and you make a mistake. Like the way it happened for me today, I’m more proud of the fact I even gave myself a chance.”Rory McIlroy’s tilt at glory looked destined for failure by the time he reached the 3rd tee. The Northern Irishman double bogeyed the 2nd, a scenario which left him with far too much to do in his quest to win a second US Open. McIlroy’s 72 meant a tied ninth finish and tale of what might have been.Adam Scott was amongst those to briefly play their way into contention. The Australian reached nine under par before carving his tee shot into the front garden of a Pebble Beach mansion from the 13th tee. Less relevant, but just as striking, was Scott’s 3ft putt for par on 16 that came to rest 7ft beyond the hole. Perhaps this was a lesson from the fashion gods towards Scott for the wearing of brown trousers that resembled the outfit of a landscape gardener. Scott dug his way to seventh, where he had Louis Oosthuizen for finishing company.Viktor Hovland created history with the lowest US Open 72 hole aggregate by an amateur. The 21-year-old from Oslo signed off with a 67 for a total of 280, or four under par. Big things, quite understandably, will be expected of Hovland when he imminently turns professional. “I hope that I can feed off of this and be in contention for winning tournaments,” Hovland said after completing quite the double he has won low amateur honours at the Masters and US Open within little over two months.Tiger Woods waited until Sunday to deliver his best round of the week, a 69, with his total of two under meaning a tie for 21st. “I’m going to take a little bit of time off and enjoy some family time,” said Woods, whose next competitive stop is expected to be the Open Championship. Woodland will do likewise with a trophy for added company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb66f54ea2eecf59d6a3fa6768324b2ffd1ccb52/51_345_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a61eaca0fc28cc1c7b9581ec2b3afad","title":"while the sun shines review orange tree richmond terence rattigan","story":"Orange Tree, RichmondSuperb performances power the ingeniously plotted story of a young earl’s marriage to the daughter of an impoverished dukeThe whirligig of time, as Shakespeare observed, brings in its revenges. Virtually banished in his later years by the Royal Court revolution, Terence Rattigan is now in constant revival and this 1943 farce comes up fresh as paint in Paul Miller’s strongly cast production.The plot revolves around a young earl’s impending marriage to the daughter of an impoverished Scottish duke. The problem is that, on the wedding eve, a muscular American bombardier and a passionate French lieutenant find themselves smitten by the future bride, which leads to a middle act full of buoyant confusion. You could argue that Rattigan trades in national stereotypes and sees women as either virgins or vamps but his play is an elegant construct full of coded messages. The earl, in particular, is a sexually ambivalent figure unusually ready to share his bed with his amatory rivals. He is also repeatedly seen as an emblem of a doomed class. When he protests that he reads the New Statesman, he is briskly told: “That will not save you from extinction.”But, while the play hints at familiar Rattigan themes of English emotional diffidence and impending social change, it is chiefly enjoyable for the ingenuity of its plotting. It is also superbly played, with Philip Labey lending the earl an aristocratic effeteness offset by the unmasked virility of Julian Moore-Cook as the American and the volcanic explosiveness of Jordan Mifsud as the Frenchman. Sabrina Bartlett as the gauche bride and Dorothea Myer-Bennett as a good-hearted predator invest their characters with exceptional substance and the whole show suggests that Rattigan, even at his most effervescently escapist, reveals more of himself than he realises.• At the Orange Tree, Richmond, until 27 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7711b877a1c34b3d40c05ab3435179617da4329c/496_438_3943_2366/master/3943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2002230bdf3290d9a9c15e8861509bc","title":"best true wireless earbuds airpods samsung jabra sennheiser anker compared and ranked","story":"Our updated list of great bluetooth truly wireless earbuds – at the best prices right now It wasn’t long ago that true wireless earbuds, those that don’t need any wires even between the earphones, weren’t very good. Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful.But they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet – once you’ve experienced tangle-free listening, you’ll never go back.Now there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it’s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here’s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff.This  buyer’s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 17 June, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you.Welcome to one of the ’s new buyer’s guides. This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the  may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer\u0027s guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.Nailing the combination of connectivity, sound, in-ear comfort, controls and case size has proved far more difficult for truly wireless earbuds than you might expect. Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try.The Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them.A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause.The Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They’re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there’s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price.Bluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you’re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, inidually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call – something only Apple’s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung’s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you’re on speaker phone.Even the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone.Pairing with an Android phone with Samsung’s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones.When paired with an Android phone you can also get the Galaxy Buds to read out notifications, which is far more useful than it sounds if you limit the number of apps, that can interrupt your music to just a few. There’s no iOS app for changing settings, which means you need at least one Android device in your life to make sure they’re up to date.The Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don’t like canal-buds.Buy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just workDon’t buy if: you only use iOS or don’t like canal-budsIf you’re looking for the best sound from truly wireless earbuds that tick nearly every other box, then check out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless.They are relatively large but light, looking like a Rolo sweet or a tiny fez with an earbud projecting out of the corner. The included rubber ear tips, of which there are four of varying sizes, sit in your ear canal while the rest of the earbud can either float just outside or be twisted to fit just inside your ear in the concha. They’re fairly comfortable and stay put, which is good because they don’t come with any wings or other attachments to hold them in place.They come in a fairly small grey hard fabric case, with a spring-loaded lid that opens and shuts with a satisfying click. The earbuds last between three and four hours of constant listening and can be recharged up to three times from the case, which itself is charged via a USB-C cable.Connectivity is excellent. Not once did they suffer a drop out in testing or lipsync issue, supporting AAC, aptX and the new aptX Low Latency Bluetooth codecs. Call quality is good but a bit distant.The best bit is how they sound. The True Wireless earbuds offer fairly good isolation, while music is rich, lively and warm. Those looking for more neutral sound might be disappointed, but the earbuds produce crisp highs and deep bass, sounding great with most music genres. You can also tweak the equaliser slightly using Sennheiser’s Android or iOS app.Take out an earbud and the music pauses and restarts when you put it back in. Each earbud has a silver touch pad too. Tap the left once to pause, twice and trice to skip track or tap and hold to turn down the volume. Tap the right once to invoke Siri or Google Assistant, twice to pause the music and activate transparency mode, or tap and hold to turn up the volume. The controls work pretty well, but you will likely press a button when getting them in and out of your ear.Great sound, rock solid connectivity, no lag and aptX LL support, good battery life, a fairly compact case and useful touch controls make the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless one of the very best.Buy if: you want good connectivity and great sound with plenty of bassDon’t buy if: you want more balanced soundIf you don’t like blocking out the world, or can’t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple’s AirPods, now in their second generation.They gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple’s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.Where they fall down is on-board controls - there’s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There’s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.With the second generation AirPods you can also just say “Hey Siri” at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple’s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.The AirPods’ other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (£40$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android usersBuy if: you use Apple products and don’t need sound isolationDon’t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside worldIf you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible.Available in black or white, they’re light and easy to forget you’re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres.An Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings.Noise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you’re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to.Unusually, there’s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you’ll have to speak up, and there’s no sidetone, so it’s difficult to know how loud you’re talking.Tap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there’s no volume control at all, so you’ll have to reach for your phone for that.They last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk.If you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it.Buy if: you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbudsDon’t buy if: you want a smaller case or better soundAnker is a brand known for quality charging accessories including batteries and cables, but its budget true wireless earbuds are some of the best around.The Liberty Air are among the latest additions to the line featuring better sound, rock-solid connectivity with support for AAC and a smaller case.They’re light, comfortable and sound surprisingly good for the money, with clear vocals, fairly crisp highs and relatively pronounced bass. They have a more balanced sound than the company’s previous Liberty Lite earbuds.Both the case and design are clearly inspired by Apple’s AirPods with stalks that project down from the earbud and a case that snaps shut over them. If you don’t like stalks, look elsewhere. The case is one of the most pocketable, but bigger than Apple’s and easily marked.You get more than four hours of constant playback and three full charges in the case, which itself is charged via microUSB cable. The earbuds lack buttons instead a double tap on the right earbud plays or pauses the music, tap and hold for two seconds on the right earbud to skip to the next track or left for the previous track. There’s no volume control unfortunately and only the right earbud can be used on its own.Call quality was excellent. Loud, clear and with excellent suppression of background noise for the other end of the call.Compact case, good sound, connectivity and battery, plus no noticeable lipsync issues, the Anker Liberty Air are the best budget truly wireless earbudsBuy if: you want truly wireless earbuds on a budgetDon’t buy if: you want really great sound or hate stalksThere are many different types of wireless Bluetooth headphones, but the newest and neatest are the truly wireless earbuds.Unlike neckband earphones or regular Bluetooth earbuds, truly wireless earbuds have no cables connecting between them, freeing the wearer of all cords and cables.Removing all cables means transmitting audio and data between them through your head, which is not an easy task. Many early versions could not maintain a solid connection and therefore had frequent, annoying dropouts.A codec is the system used to transmit the audio signal over the Bluetooth connection which both the phone and headphones must support. There are a variety of codecs available for Bluetooth headphones, with SBC being the default, which is the lowest quality and supported by all Bluetooth audio devices. AAC is an upgrade that most support, with Sony\u0027s LDAC and Qualcomm\u0027s aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency and the newest aptX Adaptive supported by some.Apple\u0027s iPhone notably does not support Bluetooth codecs higher than AAC, but many Android smartphones and newer Bluetooth headphones support at least aptX.Along with variances in audio quality, different codecs have different latency in their transmission of sound. Latency is the time it takes for a sound to be sent to the earphone and be played, which is important because if it is too high the audio track does not match up with video, leading to irritating lipsync issues.Most headphones that only support SBC will have lipsync issues, while AAC and higher can help negate the problem.Some earbuds have the ability to play sounds from the outside world picked up by microphones through the speakers, providing an awareness of what\u0027s happening in the world through the earbuds. Some automatically activate ambient sound on pause, while others can mix it with music or have dedicated modes for listening out for announcements or similar.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEach earbud has to have a battery in it, therefore to squeeze everything into a small enough package to fit in your ear has mean small batteries and fairly short runtimes. But they are not all born equally with some lasting as much as five hours between charges.Short battery life and lack of wires means most truly wireless earbuds come with a charging case with an integrated battery to keep the earbuds safe and topped up. Some charging cases are huge and heavy, others small and light - important to note if you want to carry it in your pocket.Most will have a canal-bud design with an ear tip of varying sizes that enters the ear canal. Alongside the tip many have wings or a body design that is intended to lock into the hollow next to the ear canal called the concha to hold it in place.Here is where the most comfort problems arise, as too much pressure on the soft bits of the ear around the concha will cause pain.These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don’t fit the bill.Anker’s smaller true wireless earbuds are an excellent budget option, but have a larger case and are bettered on sound and call quality by the Liberty Air. They can be found for slightly cheaper and don’t have the AirPod-like stalk design, so are still worth buying if the price or earbud design suits you better. Not good for phone calls though.B\u0026ampO’s second-generation E8 are a solid mix of sound quality and connectivity with a fairly small case. They last just under four hours’ playtime, with two full charges in the case, which itself is charged via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. Touch panels on each earbud take care of controls, including volume, and they have an reasonable transparency mode too. They support AAC, can connect to two devices simultaneously, but can’t be used independently. Call quality is reasonable.The biggest issue is their size: the E8s are massive for earbuds and don’t feel all that stable in your ears unless you use the included Comply foam tips. They’re also expensive and bettered by the Sennheisers on the audio quality front.If you want more isolation than the AirPods but can’t get on with canal-bud style tips, the Bose SoundSport Free provide a good halfway house. The StayHear+ tips rest in your concha but don’t enter your ear canal, holding themselves in-place with a flexible fin.They sound good, connectivity is rock solid with AAC support, call quality is really good, and they last more than four hours between charges. The large case provides two full charges. The biggest problem is that they’re huge and stick out your ear a mile. At least the call quality is good.The Jabra Elite 65t are a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds. They have rock-solid connectivity, support for AAC, no noticeable lipsync issues and sound good, with punchy, controlled bass plus a full equaliser in the Jabra Sound+ app.There are volumetrack skip buttons on the left earbud and a pauseplay button on the right, which activates ambient sound when double pressed. Call quality is good with clear voice, but background noise bleeds into the mic a little. The case is pretty compact and charges the buds twice totalling to 12 hours’ playback.The Elite 65t twist to lock in place in the ear, but are fairly large and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions for smaller ears.If the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless don’t fit the bill but you want great sound, then the Master and Dynamic MW07 are worth a look.They sound good, with pronounced bass and crisp highs, but fall slightly short of the better-sounding Sennheiser. There’s a slight hiss when nothing is playing, but have rock-solid connectivity with AAC and aptX support. The buds are also fairly large and certainly a statement in piano gloss. The wings are a bit uncomfortable, but I didn’t need them.The case is medium sized, and feels good in the hand, but is heavy and the earbuds don’t quite snap into place unless the lid is closed. Physical buttons for controls are great, including volume. Calls sounded echoey.Like black Apple AirPods but with a traditional isolating earbud on the end to enter your ear, the RHA TrueConnect sound good with strong bass and solid isolation, but poor call quality.Connectivity is pretty good including AAC support, with only a very occasional blip while suffering only minimal lipsync issues with video. Latency is more of an issue with games. They last four hours per charge, with four full charges in an attractive, medium-sized case.A button on each earbud handles volume, track skip, pause, play and the voice assistant all accessible with multiple clicks. The button felt mushy on one set requiring replacement.Sony’s WF-1000X are nearly excellent, and offer something most rival true wireless earbuds don’t: active noise cancelling.They sound good and fit fairly well with a good selection of earbuds and wings to hold them in place. They’re medium sized, with a unique look that resembles mini Bluetooth headsets. Subtle they are not.The active noise cancelling works well at nullifying the roar of a plane’s engine, but they’re not on the same scale as Sony’s MX1000M3 headphones. They also only last about three hours of constant listening, which is fine for an internal flight but not much longer. The case contains about two full charges.There are two big issues with the WF-1000X that knock them down a couple of stars. They have intermittent connectivity issues with both Android and iPhone and have lipsync issues in some apps but not all. The case is also pretty big and overly complicated.The Tranya T3 are a solid set of budget true wireless earbuds with a reasonably bassy sound, good connectivity and AAC support. A button on each earbud takes care of controls. Isolation is fairly weak and the case is pretty bulky and easily marked. Call quality was abysmal and there was a small lipsync issue with YouTube on an iPhone.CrazyBaby Air Nano – Connectivity and latency issues – £70Jabra Elite Sport – Big, bulky and bettered by the newer Jabra Elite 65t – £200Jaybird Run – Solid for runners, but unacceptable latency issues – £159JBL Free X – Large case and terrible latency issues – £120JLabs JBuds Air – Sound fine, but only SDC support means latency issues – £50NuForce BE Free8 – OK sound, but constant hiss and connectivity issues – £200Rowkin Ascent Micro – small, sound OK, but serious latency issues – £125Skullycandy Indy – Sound ok, but get stuck in the case and suffer lag with an iPhone – £70Taotronics BH053 – sound OK, but cheap plastic with questionable durability and lag with YouTube – £38TicPods Free – Good sound and controls, but terrible latency – £120Urbanista Stockholm – AirPod ripoffs with poor fit and weak sound – £89 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91daf65e5189adb74f43597fdc63d477ef212d77/0_268_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5de88891058b6247fc386947f1c15c3","title":"top gear review gentler kinder and all the better for it","story":"With Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness joining Chris Harris, the banter is barbed but good-natured, the gags less non-PC – and imagine Clarkson and co doing an episode on electric cars?Remind me: where had we got to with Top Gear? Ever since Jeremy Clarkson got sacked for punching that producer – amazingly, more than four years ago – the BBC has struggled to replace, or revive, or reboot the formula that made the show such a storming success. There was the new model with Matt LeBlanc and Chris Evans that didn’t really work. Then they tried a cut-and-shut version – without Evans, but with LeBlanc – but that didn’t really work either.The latest incarnation on BBC Two retains Evans’s replacement, motoring journalist Chris Harris, and partners him with – wait for it – Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness, the former England cricket captain and the erstwhile host of history’s most execrable game show, Take Me Out. It seems that the producers of Top Gear had developed a casting strategy based on that parlour game where you pull the names of celebrities out of a hat, and everyone keeps saying: “Sorry, I have no idea who this person is.”But you know what? Against all the odds, it works. It gives me no particular pleasure to suggest that some of the original magic of Top Gear has been rekindled by this unlikely trio, but, miraculously, it has. The larky, bad-tempered chemistry that existed between Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond has been replicated in a slightly sunnier form, and with a fresh energy. The old format has life in it yet.The first thing you notice is how young they all look. I mean relatively – they are all in their 40s – but compared with the grumpy, fed-up trio that took their act to Amazon and launched The Grand Tour, Harris, Flintoff and McGuinness look like a bold experiment in youth outreach. And to have not one but two northern presenters seems, in the context of Top Gear, like a stab at ersity. “I genuinely cannot understand a single word you two are saying,” says Harris at the outset.For this series – the 27th – most of the gimmicky short segments have been dispensed with. The Stig is mentioned in passing, but does not appear. There are no celebrity guests. The main event is a junket to Ethiopia, with each presenter driving an approximation of the first car they ever owned: a Ford Escort, a Mini and, for Flintoff, a Porsche Boxster (he was a professional cricketer, after all).The vehicles disintegrate in the manner we have all come to expect. Tempers fray a little in the heat, and the trio take part in some deeply stupid challenges (one of them involves driving while blindfolded), with a chunky knit jumper being awarded to the loser. McGuinness and Flintoff seize every opportunity to remind Harris that he is short. It is as undemanding as ever, although, for a brief moment when Harris demonstrates how to change a tyre without using a jack, I think I might be on the verge of learning something.This new incarnation is, if not exactly politically correct, at least not as aggressively un-PC as it was in the Clarkson days, when every segment seemed to be staged in defiance of the imagined objections of a muesli-eating, -reading, bicycle-riding straw man. The beauty of Ethiopia is frequently extolled, whereas before it might have served as a backdrop for a borderline racist prank. As if to assert how far the series has moved on, next week’s episode is devoted to electric cars. Try to imagine that happening under the Clarkson-Hammond-May axis. They would have probably just set fire to them, to the cheers of the studio audience.In that old line-up, the banter between the presenters could often feel more like workplace bullying. There was a period when it seemed that Clarkson and May were actively trying to murder Hammond – and there was a brief window when they might have got away with it. In contrast, the insults traded by McGuinness, Flintoff and Harris are barbed, but good-natured. The chemistry between them may be a fabrication, but it is chemistry nonetheless. What they share with Clarkson and his mates is a reliable comic timing. McGuinness may be the only one with “comedian” on his CV, but it is Harris who holds it all together. He has a wonderful deadpan stare, which makes him look angry and hurt at the same time.Top Gear’s great success lay in its appeal to viewers who didn’t care about cars. It was crowdpleasing fare it went nowhere, fast. On this showing, it’s not going anywhere soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f539b5a098190460b808d5a3e25f59789bbc5117/0_288_5129_3077/master/5129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40a9695daa7664e8e591caacde6dd159","title":"top gear sprays lgbt pride flag on cars used in brunei filming","story":"Motoring show makes gesture after hearing of country’s threat to punish gay sex with death by stoningSupport for LGBT rights has come from a surprising quarter after Top Gear sprayed two cars used in filming in Brunei in rainbow colours in opposition to the country’s threat to make homosexuality punishable by stoning to death.Thought to be the first time the BBC Two motoring programme has shown solidarity with the LGBT community, the move appears to back the claim made by the new lineup of Freddie Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris that they would bring a “different vibe” to the revamped show – which returned on Sunday night.Flintoff told the  he and his colleagues were horrified after hearing the announcement about the imposition of the death penalty by the south-east Asian country just after they filmed a segment there at the end of March.“We would never have filmed in Brunei had the law been announced beforehand. Like millions of other people around the world, I utterly condemn Brunei’s actions. No one deserves to be stoned to death, whoever they love. Love is love,” said Flintoff.In the segment he and McGuinness drive two rare cars across Borneo with the aid of Gurkha soldiers to the palace of the Sultan of Brunei, a car collector, where guards give them a lukewarm reception.As the Top Gear team landed in the UK after the filming they heard Brunei had just announced it planned to impose death by stoning as a punishment for gay sex and adultery, as part of the country’s implementation of sharia law.Following international outcry led by celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John, last month Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah extended a moratorium on the death penalty, saying that it would not be enforced.However, writing in the , Flintoff said: “Even though it has since been claimed that the laws will not be enforced, the threat still stands, and even the threat is an appalling abuse of human rights.”The Top Gear team considered dropping the segment but, instead, in an unusual move for the show – which has a history of culturally insensitive jokes under former presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond – they decided to spray the cars used in the film in the colours of the rainbow flag and display them on air later in the series.The message of tolerance contrasts with Amazon’s car show The Grand Tour, presented by Clarkson, May and Hammond, which the singer Will Young criticised in January for its “shaming homophobic narratives”.Top Gear’s new presenting team is aiming to modernise the BBC’s multimillion-pound brand by showing “emotional depth”, with hugs amid the competitive physicality, car reviews and boyish banter.With the third new lineup in as many years – after Clarkson was sacked for punching a producer – BBC Studios is gambling that the chemistry of the new trio can halt a ratings decline and get its series back on track.As Harris, who was in the two previous iterations of Top Gear, explained: “We live in a different world. The new Top Gear will embrace all sorts of emotions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cba8ac8f999d08a1bece8c549a1f108f5ec4eba3/175_675_2905_1743/master/2905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31062a5cb8d6c85fd01d2cae375e99fb","title":"uk and russia consider may putin meeting to thaw relations","story":"More than a year after Skripal poisoning, obstacles remain to key diplomatic stepThe UK and Russia are examining the scope for a thaw in relations, including the possibility of a meeting between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Theresa May at the G20 leaders’ summit in Japan at the end of this month.If a meeting were to go ahead it would be the first encounter at this level since the poisoning in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March last year – an episode that led to 23 Russian diplomats being expelled by the UK followed by the expulsion of a similar number of British diplomats from Russia.The loss of the quality of the expelled British diplomats has severely damaged Britain’s capacity to analyse Russia from inside the country. Moscow also closed the British Council offices and the UK’s diplomatic outpost in St Petersburg.No meeting between the two leaders would go ahead unless both sides felt certain it would be productive, and a common agenda is achievable. There is also a question of whether Putin would prefer to try to turn a new page with the UK with a new prime minister.Boris Johnson, the Conservative leadership frontrunner, was sharply critical of Russia’s actions in Syria as foreign secretary, but before the poisoning had travelled to Moscow in December 2017 to meet the long-serving Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.The G20 summit, in Osaka on 28-29 June, is likely to be May’s last international outing as prime minister. Putin briefly approached May at the last G20 in Argentina in November.It is thought to be unrealistic to expect Russia to accept responsibility for the Skripal episode, or allow the two GRU agents to be extradited for trial in the UK.The Foreign Office, and intelligence agencies, would have to judge whether some kind of acknowledgement that such episodes should not happen, or ever be repeated, the maximum likely to be offered, is sufficient for relations to be taken out of the deep freeze. Britain would need certainty that Russia had drawn the right conclusions from the episode.Britain remains certain that the Russian state was responsible for the poisoning based on the information provided by Porton Down, the government’s chemical weapons research centre.Two named Russian agents were identified by the UK government inquiry as travelling to Salisbury at the time of the poisoning, and the pair then attempted on TV to explain their visit simply as driven as tourists’ interest in the cathedral city. The inept explanation was seen as laughable inside Russia, and was thought to have embarrassed Putin.May said the operation has been conducted by GRU intelligence agents and would almost certainly have been approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state.Nevertheless, the UK side has been intrigued by recent public comments from Putin distancing the Russian political class from the actions of the spy agency. “When all’s said and done we need to turn this page connected with spies and assassination attempts,” Putin said recently on the sidelines of an economic forum in St Petersburg. He described Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to MI6, as London’s spy.“He’s your agent not ours. That means you spied against us and it’s hard for me to say what happened with him subsequently. We need to forget about all this in the final analysis,” said. According to Putin, “global issues related to common economic, social and security interests are more important than the games played by intelligence agencies”, he said.The Russian president also mentioned his recent meeting with members of the British community, describing it as “very good”.“We have $22bn-worth of British investment. These people want to feel secure. They would a positive trend in relations to emerge. We treat them as friends, whose interests must be protected regardless of the current political situation,” he said.Christian Turner, Britain’s deputy national security adviser, went to Moscow this month to meet Russian ministers and officials. A level of co-operation is needed between countries intelligence agencies so that signals, such as troop movements, are not misread."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b66ecebf900d2f47a61a3a3ab39bb5361b13393/0_34_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=555c04ab0f0cfd7995edbbe969ed7d86","title":"german afd far right loses bid mayor goerlitz after film industry petition","story":"Writers, directors and actors called on voters in Goertliz to not to succumb to AfD party’s ‘hate and enmity’ A 51-year-old immigrant has been elected mayor of a town in eastern Germany after beating a candidate from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in a campaign that drew international attention.Actors, directors and others who made films on location in Goerlitz had called on residents to vote against Wippel. The petition urged voters not to succumb to “hate and enmity, discord and exclusion”.It was signed by British director Stephen Daldry, who filmed The Reader partly in Goerlitz, actor Daniel Bruehl, who appeared in Goodbye Lenin, writer Bernhard Schlink, among others, according to France 24. AfD condemned the letter as unwelcome outside advice.The Grand Budapest Hotel and Inglourious Basterds are among the films shot in Goerlitz.The town, nicknamed Goerliwood, was spared damage by Allied bombing during the second world war, has become a tourist magnet with its spruced up historic city centre nestled on the River Neisse.The vote was seen as a pointer for German state elections on 1 September in both Saxony and in the neighbouring state of Brandenburg.The victory gives some respite to Merkel, whose national coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) was shaken by heavy losses in European parliamentiary elections in May.“It was not a vote for Mr Ursu but more a vote against the AfD candidate, against me,” said Wippel. “The CDU had to rely on support from many groups including from the far-left extremists without whom they would not have made it. Looking ahead to the Saxony state election, we are in a good position.”Ursu said his victory showed that most residents in Goerlitz were in favour of keeping the town open to foreigners.“I am happy that a majority has chosen to vote for me, but in the end it is not about two candidates but the orientation of this town to the outside world and that we remain an open society and do not isolate ourselves,” he said.With Reuters and Agence France-Presse"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7cc9d57f7a215783c5d82ae8e1c20a904998c88/0_115_5197_3119/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8eda1d195e717d585567911d1c07b57","title":"half of britons socialise with family and friends at most once a month","story":"Lack of interaction is damaging sense of wellbeing, says Sainsbury’s Living Well IndexNearly half of Britons socialise with family and friends only once a month or less, according to a survey.The lack of human interaction is causing the nation’s sense of wellbeing to dwindle, the Sainsbury’s Living Well Index said.Some 8,000 Britons were surveyed on everything from their sex lives, quality of sleep, finances, relationships and jobs, with an average “wellbeing score” of 60.4 out of 100.Sainsbury’s carried out the report in partnership with the National Centre for Social Research and Oxford Economics.Simon Roberts, Sainsbury’s’ retail and operations director, said: “Sainsbury’s Living Well Index has found that over the last 12 months there has been a decline of the sense of community the nation feels as a whole, which has had a significant impact on our sense of wellbeing.”Working baby boomers’ index scores fell “dramatically” – by 1.76 points on average – in the past 12 months, more than four times the average.Authors of the study said the key driver was a decline in social connections (down 0.36 points) and relationships (0.29 points).The overall score for June 2019 was almost a full point lower than in autumn 2017, when the first index was published.People were asked about a total of 60 different aspects of their lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2350c37763be44bf7f2c76d4171b86300e8af6b8/0_216_4711_2826/master/4711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4df5fa6594763ba279b291da7fae9d2","title":"libya un recognised government launches peace initiative","story":"Plan comes after efforts to persuade US that White House had wrong message on LibyaLibya’s UN-recognised government in Tripoli has sought to break the deadlock in the country’s civil war by launching a peace initiative which will include a national peace forum followed by simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections to be held by the end of the year.The plan comes after sustained diplomatic efforts by the Tripoli-based government to persuade the US that the White House had got the wrong message on Libya and was in danger of backing anti-democratic forces of Gen Khalifa Haftar, on the false premise that he was leading a fight against terrorists.Explaining the thinking behind the initiative, Ahmed Maiteeq, Libya’s deputy prime minister, said: “We have made it clear to the international community that Haftar cannot succeed. That message has got through in the United States, and many of Haftar’s other international backers realise that he cannot win. The issue is whether Haftar is willing to listen to them.”Despite more than 700 killed by the fighting, nightly bombing raids and prolonged electricity outages, Libya has been in danger of slipping down the international agenda, leading to backers of both sides pouring arms into the country and possibly entrenching the civil war.The UK has been arguing that if the crisis is left to fester it could lead to ungoverned spaces in Libya being filled by terrorists, a rise in migration across the Mediterranean and disruption to international oil markets.Elements of the peace initiative announced on Sunday by the prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, include a national reconciliation authority, with amnesties for everyone except those who have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.The UN-supervised forum will be open to all parties committed to the democratic process.Maiteeq said: “Haftar’s credibility as a strongman has been destroyed, and now we can move onto the next phase.” He added that the prime minister had been taking soundings about the way forward, not just with the UN but with political figures in Libya’s east including in Benghazi. Haftar’s stronghold is in the east of Libya.But he personally ruled out Haftar playing a role as leader of a re-unified true national army, saying he could not lead an army he has been seeking to attack. He also said any ceasefire would require some form of redeployment by Haftar’s forces away from Tripoli.Maiteeq, who has travelled to Rome, London and Washington to put the government’s case, denied that Sarraj’s administration was a cypher and really run by a jihadist militia.He said: “We were the people that fought to free Sirte from Islamic State. How come all of a sudden these forces fighting to free Sirte have become a terrorist group?”He added: “The UK could have had an an important role in the past five years. Britain just left Libya behind. Britain could do much more but all I see is British politicians just fighting on Brexit and it has been taking them away from Libya.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3923149.1560506526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"don t forget to pack travel insurance this summer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDon’t leave it until the last minute to get travel insurance  - almost 40 per cent of the claims are made before travel with illness and death the most likely reasons for cancelled holidays We all get hung up on packing like Ninjas at this time of year as we ready ourselves for holidays overseas and look to save ourselves the costs associated with checked-in bags.

A scimitar-horned oryx was born in Dublin Zoo last year.While Revenue routinely publicises its success in intercepting drugs, alcohol and cigarette smuggling, records on other less common seizures were obtained through a Freedom of Information request.As well as exotic confiscations, there were weapons – including guns, tasers, machetes and samurai swords – ammunition, food and even car parts taken from travelling passengers since the start of last year, the files disclose.Under Cites last year, officials seized a necklace from Nigeria made of hippopotamus ivory, 37 crocodile or alligator teeth from the United States, 89 dried insects from Cameroon, a white sea shell from Thailand and two boxes of bird nests from Malaysia.The combined value of all items confiscated under the convention, all of which were made at Dublin Airport, was €21,710.WeaponsAlso at the country’s largest airport since the start of last year, passengers were intercepted carrying 53 weapons – valued at €1,691 – as well as two clips of ammunition.These included rifles, guns, stun guns, air guns, pistols, component parts for firearms, lasers, tasers, throwing stars, machetes, samurai and katana swords and many varieties of illegal knives, such as flick, stiletto and butterfly knives.The items confiscated also included telescopic batons, noxious sprays and other martial arts weapons.In addition, there were 245 separate medicines removed from passengers at Dublin Airport since the start of last year, valued at more than €30,000, as well as meat and food valued at about €3,000.Revenue said it has anti-smuggling teams at all main ports and airports and at the main postal depots, who routinely profile imports and exports and carry out X-ray examinations and physical examinations based on risk assessment.When items are seized under Cites, Revenue “makes appropriate disposal arrangements” in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, following a period of appeal.“Items may be retained, destroyed or given to another agency, as appropriate,” a Revenue spokesman said.“Of the items above, some are still pending, some have been destroyed and some have been given to the Department of Agriculture, Dublin Zoo or the Natural History Museum.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3927677.1560717576!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deportations garda immigration officers flew back business class","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Justice said business class fares were booked while repatriating deportees where it was deemed a security risk for a garda to leave an airport.  Photograph: Getty ImagesGarda immigration officers have travelled on business class flights while returning home from deporting illegal immigrants out of the country, a Freedom of Information (FoI) query has revealed.The Department of Justice, which released details of the flights under FoI, said business class fares were booked while repatriating deportees where it was deemed a security risk for a garda to leave an airport. Flight tickets for the return leg of journeys – with single fares costing several thousand euro – allow Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) officers to stay in the airport lounge in the country where they are leaving deportees.A Department of Justice spokesman said the vast majority of flights by GNIB officers were economy class. Of the dozens of business class trips involving the chaperoning of illegal immigrants to their return destinations last year, several were to cities in Europe, including flights to Frankfurt listed as costing €19,600 and separately €3,800. There were also fares to Amsterdam reaching €11,000, €7,300 and €4,400. The Department of Justice said the Frankfurt flight costing €19,600 covered four GNIB officers travelling back from Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city. The €11,000 and €7,300 flights to Amsterdam were also return trips from Lagos, and covered three officers, the spokesman said. The records show there was also a business class flight to Abu Dhabi costing €6,000 and frequent business class flights to Istanbul costing tens of thousands of euro in total. The department spokesman said the Abu Dhabi flight was from Lahore in Pakistan and covered two GNIB officers. “Istanbul appears so much because it is a major hub for returns from many southeast Asian and Middle Eastern destinations.” GNIB officers usually travel in pairs when chaperoning a deportee back to a return country. Sometimes they travel in greater numbers if it is deemed necessary under particular security circumstances. Cost of the flights Last year bills totalled €164,865 for business class flights. The spokesman added that the State can recoup 75 per cent of the cost of the flights from the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.Almost 50 flights during 2018 were listed as business or first class, although 13 of these were cancelled and one was misclassified, according to the Department of Justice.“All 36 business class flights relate to situations where GNIB officers are accompanying people being removed from the State on foot of deportation orders,” the spokesman said. “Business class flights are booked where it is considered by An Garda Síochána that it would be a security risk for Irish officers to leave the airport in the destination country and to stay overnight in a hotel. “By booking business class flights the officers can stay in the airline’s lounge until a return flight leaves to one of the European hubs. An economy class flight is then booked from the European hub back to Dublin. “We understand that many EU member states apply the same practice for their officers on return operations.”There were 860 “repatriation” flights booked last year. Destinations included Albania, Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, Malawi, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nepal, Panama, Qatar, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe.

Video: Transdev Ireland\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí and emergency services personnel at the scene of a crash between a truck and a Luas at the junction of Benburb Street and Queen Street in Dublin. File photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsJunctions at Blackhall Place and Queen Street in Dublin’s north inner city have the highest number of collisions on the Luas network, according to Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). The state agency said despite “various interventions” at both locations, collisions and near misses continue to be recorded. The comments were made in a submission from TII’s Director of Professional Services, Helen Hughes, to the National Transport Authority (NTA) in relation to the proposed Blanchardstown to city centre corridor under the BusConnects plan last March. Ms Hughes said, in response to the collisions and near misses: “Luas operations have been modified resulting in delay to trams through this area and impacting on the ability to maintain headways”. “TII would welcome the opportunity to participate in the design of these junctions to ensure that Luas operation and safety are not compromised,” she said. In a joint project involving the NTA, the Garda and Dublin City Council, a pilot camera was set up where the Luas red line crosses Blackhall Place in June 2015, which detected 1,300 road users breaking the lights over an 18-month period.The Garda wrote to the NTA earlier this year to confirm the Blackhall Place camera will be run permanently to detect red light running and recommended two additional camera installations be set up at Con Colbert Road and on Queen Street.The NTA said it would “seek to advance these arrangements in collaboration with Dublin City Council and with An Garda Síochána”. Luas operator Transdev said busy city centre junctions and those in the suburbs face the same problem - “motorists, some consciously, others noticeably distracted, breaking red traffic lights”. “The resulting impact on the tram service is stoppages and delays. Motorists need to stop amber gambling and understand a tram is on a track, it cannot swerve, and trams take time to stop,” a spokeswoman for Transdev said. TII’s submission for the Blanchardstown corridor also noted the emerging preferred route proposes the extension of existing bus lane facilities through the M50N3 junction, “reducing the number of general traffic lanes”. Loss of capacityThe provision of dedicated bus lanes through the M50N3 junction will “inevitably result in a loss of capacity at this junction,” Ms Hughes said. “The information as presented to date does not demonstrate the impact of this loss of capacity and as such TII cannot comment on this proposal at this time. “In addition to the loss of capacity, the provision of dedicated lanes may result in longer weaving movements on approach to the junction which could lead to undesirable and unsafe driver behaviour,” she added. In a separate submission, Ms Hughes noted there are two alternative options presented by the NTA for the Santry village area in relation to the Swords to city centre corridor. The NTA has proposed one-way traffic passing through Santry in the northbound direction while southbound traffic would be erted via Coolock Lane and the Santry bypass.The alternative option includes a widening of the Swords Road through Santry to allow a traffic lane in each direction to be maintained, in addition to the bus lanes, which would impact on the front gardens of between 70 to 80 properties.TII said the national roads in the surrounding areas of Santry village cater for “significant traffic volumes and regularly suffer periods of congestion and poor journey time reliability”. “Options that reduce the volume of traffic transferring onto the national roads network in this area would be preferred by TII,” Ms Hughes said. The NTA has said it would not be commenting on inidual submissions and that all submissions will be “read and reviewed” in the coming months. Public consultation in relation to core bus corridor project closed last month A revised redesign of the network is due to be published in September and a further round of public consultation will begin.TII is responsible for the country’s national roads and light rail infrastructure."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3923676.1560371157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ballot to decide if diaspora should be allowed vote for president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney  is one of two Ministers who have been given approval to draft the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Constitution to allow the Irish diaspora a vote. File photograph: The Irish voters are likely to decide on whether or not to extend the vote in presidential elections to Irish citizens abroad in October.Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister for Local Government Eoghan Murphy have been given approval to draft the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Constitution to allow the Irish diaspora a vote. If the referendum is to adhere to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s preferred date of October, the full Bill will have to be published by the end of July, along with the proposed amending legislation. This will allow enough time for a referendum commission be established and have sufficient time to conduct its work. That will involve a lot of work. The proposal will be scrutinised by the Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs before the heads of Bill are published. The full Bill will then need to be signed off by the Government ahead of its last meeting before the summer break, which is provisionally scheduled for mid-July. Over three years ago, in 2016, the Convention on the Constitution, while declining to reduce the term of the presidency from seven years to five, voted in favour of extending the vote in presidential elections to Irish people living abroad. That decision dovetails with the Government’s Global Ireland 2025 policy, which wants to harness potential of the large and erse Irish community living abroad. The Government has said that many countries worldwide already provide for voting by those of their citizens resident outside the State.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn a statement this week, the Government said: “The presidency serves a very different function to the Dáil and Seanad. This referendum will be about reimagining a presidency for the 21st century, a presidency that represents the Irish nation not just the State, and that is elected by all citizens.”Such an alteration will involve many logistical changes. The period of the election campaign will be extended from 60 to 90 days. This will allow sufficient time for a postal ballot to issue to electors resident outside the State and for ballot papers to be completed and returned in good time for the election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat about Northern Ireland?There are many other practical hurdles to surmount in advance of the next presidential election in 2025, should the referendum pass. Those will include the registration of voters from outside of the State, how they would vote, and where they would vote as well as extensive information campaigns. There would also have to be arrangements for counting potentially hundreds of thousands of postal votes. However, the biggest material change will be that voters in the North will be able to vote in presidential elections. That has the potential to hugely influence the outcome. Groups representing Irish emigrants have long campaigned for them to have voting rights. There has been a debate on the merits of extending the franchise. Some have argued against allowing Irish citizens living abroad to vote in general elections on the basis they do not have to experience the government that has been elected, or are not fully aware of the actual situation on the ground in Ireland. In 2011, an online poll conducted among Irish emigrants based in the US suggested that their preference for the presidency was David Norris.

More than 1.2 million people born in the 1950s reported owning an additional property - including buy-to-let and overseas - between 2014 and 2016.The number of British adults who own a second property has grown by 53 per cent since 2001, sitting at 5.5 million people and a total value of £941 billion.The figures come despite the overall decline of home ownership across the UK, which peaked in 2003 at 58 per cent of families but then continued falling until 2016.The rise in multiple property ownership is down to a “rapid growth” in the number of people buying houses in Britain to rent out, the report said, with almost two million people - the majority being older, higher income and southern - owning buy-to-lets.The second home boom has also benefited millennials, with seven per cent of those born in the 1960s and 1980s having additional property wealth by the age of 29,  the Foundation’s Game of Homes report found.The “surprisingly rapid rise” of multiple property ownership among the young generation could mean that those currently in their 30s may be on the way to similar rates of additional property ownership as today’s middle-aged cohorts.“If we were to redraw the chart of additional property ownership by age in thirty years’ time, there is a chance it might not look particularly different from today,” the report said.Buy to letThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Heres the latest.The former Foreign Secretary quit his role because he disagreed with Theresa Mays plan for Brexit and is currently the bookies favourite to win the leadership contest.Boris Johnson was at the helm of the Vote Leave campaign back in  and nearly beat the current PM to the role after Cameron resigned.Since the referendum the -year-old has been brandishing his leave credentials. In a speech in Switzerland he vowed to take Britain out of the EU with a deal or no deal come October he gets chosen.Johnson said he would hold the EU to ransom and refuse to pay the £billion orce bill unless they agree to more favourable terms for Brexit.He also vowed to slash income tax for three million Brits.He said: Our friends and partners need to understand that the money is going to be retained until such time as we have greater clarity about the way forward.I always thought it was extraordinary that we should agree to write that entire cheque before having a final deal. In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.Johnson comfortably topped the poll from the first round of voting, securing  votes from his colleagues.This is well above the  needed to guarantee his place in the final two, making him a firm favourite as it stands.But supporters were reminded that only once in the history of the Conservative party has the favourite ever been elected.The Foreign Secretary who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum is the second favourite for leader.Jeremy Hunt claims his business background would help him negotiate a good deal with Brussels as doing deals is my bread and butter as someone who has set up their own business.The -year-old said he would back a No Deal Brexit with a heavy heartit was the only option left.Hunt has said he wants to slash corporation tax to boost businesses.On June  he claimed Germany’s Angela Merkel COULD renegotiate Brexit with a new Tory PM.He has the backing of Amber Rudd.While in second place after the first round vote, Hunt is trailing far behind Johnson with only just over a third of his share.But Amber Rudd, who is backing Hunt, said he came a good second and was delighted with the result.The Environment Secretary announced his bid to be the next Prime Minister on June .Michael Gove has said he is willing to delay Brexit for as long as needed to ensure a deal is agreed rather than just crashing out on October .He is posing as a unying candidate and said: I believe that Im ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country.Gove notably defended Theresa Mays Brexit deal in the House of Commons.However, his chances may have been dented by his cocaine admission.After the first round, Gove came a close third after Hunt and Johnson with  votes.The former Brexit Secretary is another of the top Conservatives who has thrown his hat into the ring and has hard Brexit credentials.Raab has said he would prefer to exit the EU with a deal but is prepared to accept a No Deal Brexit on October .The -year-old MP for Esher and Walton said the UK must calmly demonstrate unflinching resolve to leave in October - at the latest.Like McVey he has said Parliament could be suspended to ensure Brexit takes placehe enters Number  with the top job.He quit his role as Mrs Mays Brexit Secretary in November  saying he could not support her plan.He has promised a pay rise for millions of workers after Brexit.Raab won  votes but will be hoping to gain momentum over the race.The Home Secretary announced his candidacy in a video on Twitter and was one of the Remain campaigners in .Sajid Javid, , has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit but has positioned himself as a firm Remainer.But speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sunday he said: The policy of any government I lead will be to leave on  October. We will do everything in our power to leave on  October.I will do everything I can to get a deal, butI have to choose between no deal and no Brexit, I will choose no deal.If elected the Bromsgrove MP would be the UKs first Prime Minister from an ethnic minority.He has pledged to end austerity and pump billions into education.Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson has given him her support.It is thought defeated Andrea Leadsom could back Sajid Javid after he secured  votes in the first round.In a moving message the Home Secretary insisted he was ideally placed to lead a Conservative Government that would aim to bring people from all sides together.He said: “We talked a moment ago about whether someone is Remain or Leave, whether someone is black or white, North or South, urban or rural, and whatever happens this is the number one thing, we have to address in our countrywe are staying together as a cohesive society.“I think it is incumbent upon all politicians, especially when we see around the world, in the US, Italy and others, there are politicians that want to feed off anger and feed off ision, that we as Conservatives always look at the best in people and try to bring them together.”He said he had lived with prejudice for most of his le – but believed Britain was the “most successful multi-racial democracy in the world”.Health Secretary Matt Hancock dropped out of the running after securing only  votes in the first ballot.The new International Development Secretary launched his leadership bid in The Spectator and has since told of his one-time opium use.The Penrith MP has been scathing about a No Deal Brexit and claimed it would be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and I think also dishonest.Rory Stewart has outlined his intention to fulfil Brexit and use a citizens assembly and a grand jury to help parliament to hammer out a deal with the EU that works for the country.Stewart believes a No Deal Brexit would cause huge financial implications for Brexit and is focused on a practical deal.He said he would lock up MPs over the summer to get the deal done.Hes also said hell build two million new homes.Apparently undeterred by winning only  votes in the first round, Stewarts insists hes the only one who can stop Boris Johnson in the PM race.The former leader of the House of Commons announced her second leadership bid in the Sunday Times.Andrea Leadsom is a pro-Brexit MP and has previously described the UKs continued membership of the EU as disgusting and claimed a Eurosceptic Prime Minister would have delivered Brexit already.Leadsom has also claimed that she would take the UK out of the EU on October  whether a deal is agreed or not.The -year-old added that in order to resolve uncertainty for EU nationals she would introduce a citizens rights Bill and then seek an agreement in other areas where consensus already exists, such as on reciprocal health care.She was once the joint second favourite alongside Michael Gove, but was eliminated after first-round voting on June , when she won the backing of just  MPs.The former chief whip was one of the unexpected faces in the leadership race and  campaigned for Remain in .But the Forest of Dean MP and former Immigration Minister has saidthe Conservatives fail to deliver Brexit the party will not survive.Mark Harper, , has said Brexit may need to be delayed beyond October  in order to negotiate a suitable deal with Brussels.Speaking to the New Statesman, Mr Harper said: “You can either leave on  October or, in the worst, worst case scenario, have a short, focused extension, probably before the end of the year, where you’ve just got some work to do on specic things that may not have been practically able to be done before  October - particularly given that there is going to be a new Commission, and I understand that they don’t formally take office until the beginning of November.The East Surrey MP resigned his ministerial post in protest over Mrs Mays proposed Brexit deal.Harper failed to get past the first round of voting after winning just ten votes.The former work and pensions secretary announced her bid on LBC and is known for being incredibly pro-Brexit.Esther McVey has said she is prepared to suspend Parliament to force Brexit through, no mattershe has a deal or not.In a comment piece for the Sundayshe wrote: This country needs a genuinely bold, new approach. So we must now leave the EU on October  with a clean break.Its time to recapture that optimism which brought about the referendum result, provide the country with a clear direction and deliver the clean Brexit people voted for.The Tatton MP quit Mays cabinet back in November in protest over the Prime Ministers proposed Brexit plan which had failed to get through Parliament.McVey was eliminated in the first round after only securing nine votes.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He immediately gave as speech in which he declared not to be omnipotent. He said I’m not a god.“He admitted his part in the error before resigning from the defence council.“This was all in preparation for the purge and to squash discontent and explain how he’d misunderstood Trump.”In his meeting with the brash New Yorker, Kim reportedly asked for economic sanctions against North Korea to be dropped infor the part-dismantling of his nuclear arsenal.Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo balked at the dictator’s terms and walked away from the meeting.Since then, there have been numerous reports of foreign ministry being executed following the failure of the summit.However, reports that Kim Hyok-chol, the former envoy to the US, was killed in March have proved to be .Another official, Kim Yong-chol was reported to have been sent to a concentration camp – however he was recently pictured at an event with the despot.Dr Hemmings, who briefs the UK Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence on matters relating to Asia, said that it is hard to very stories about the “utterly bizarre” regime which has been a diplomatic basket case for decades.He said: “In  years of covering North Korea it is still impossible to know what is anecdotal and what is true.“Its hard to know whether these are rumours being fed by the regime to create fear ortheyre made up by North Koreas enemies.”However, the expert said he has no reason to doubt reports of officials being executed following the Trump summit.He said: “Kim was clearly angry. So I dont doubt there are purges and that people are being removed and punished - they might be sent out to labour camps or they may be executed.”Dr Hemmings added that dictators such as Kim view purges as “a necessary exercise” to maintain their ruthless grip on power.He said that the -year-old styles himself as “one of the people” much like his beloved grandfather Kim Il-sung who was the first leader of the rogue state.This would explain why Kim resigned from the defence council and admitted his fault for the disastrous meeting in Hanoi, the expert said.Dr Hemmings said: “Hes trying to be more like his grandfather - the way he dresses. He has the same buzz cut hairstyle“Kim also tried to be a little more regular - even though I know this sounds really contrary to what weve seen - he still tries to be a regular guy.“His resignation from that position is another example of this.“When he was in Singaporehe talked about reforming the country.“So hes trying to go after his own grandfathers image which was more beloved to the people. ““Kim has tried to move away from the ‘godhood of the family” - he even gave that speech after Vietnam where he professed his mortality and resigned from a position.“Thats someone who is trying to create an image of just another man suffering with his people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chernobyl power station safe visit tourists","story":"Heres what we know about Chernobyl power plant, and why the writer of the Sky Original series has urged tourists to show respect.Chernobyl is a ghost city in the restricted Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, where a power plant explosion claimed the lives of dozens of people  years ago.At least  people died following exposure to radiation, but the World Health Organisation has estimated that thousands of people could eventually be exposed to fatal radiation.Chernobyl is situated in northern Kieve Oblast in Ukraine, near the border with Belarus.The site and the nearby city of Pripyat were evacuated on April , ,  hours after the most disastrous nuclear accident in history.Pripyat, a city of , people and far closer to the power plant than Chernobyl itself, was built in the s as a home for the power plant workers.The city and surrounding area have been largely deserted ever since - although an estimated , tourists visited in .The site and Pripyat have been safe for tourists to visit since .Tourists have to be screened before they enter the Exclusion Zone and are told not to touch anything within the cordon.There are around  villages in the Exclusion Zone, the -mile radius around the power plant.Holiday companies offer packages that give an official tour of the Exclusion Zone.The ghost town also includes a school that features in Call of Duty - an abandoned Ferris wheel and homes frantically deserted when evacuation began.The eerie site has recently become a lewd hotspot for Instagram influencers to capture the perfect selfie in light of the recent gripping Sky Original series Chernobyl, which aired in May-June  on Sky Atlantic.Since then, social media influencers have come in droves to visit the ghostly wreckage - including one seen posing half naked in a G-string and a hazmet suit.The shows writer, Craig Mazine, said its wonderful that a wave of people had visited.But he urged visitors to remember that a terrible tragedy occurred there.Comport yourselves with respect for all who suffered and sacriced, he wrote on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scrap tv licenses oap","story":"It would be dead without those of us who remember Top Of The Pops, Blackadder, Harry Carpenter, Boys From The Blackstuff, Kenneth Wolstenholme, the Dimblebys, The Likely Lads, Monty Python’s Flying Circus and the Hairy Cornflake.By stupidly scrapping free TV licences for .million people aged over , the BBC just burst its own golden bubble. You silly old Auntie! Despite the BBC’s unapologetically anti-Brexit bias, millions will go to the grave with a soft spot for the Beeb.But the brutal truth is that young adults born this century do not give a damn about the BBC. My -year-old daughter and her generation have no contact with the corporation.These kids think David Attenborough is that nice old man saving the planet on Netflix. They are big on BuzzFeed. They get their ­entertainment from YouTube, Netflix and Instagram.Even Facebook and Twitter seem horribly old hat to these teenagers. The BBC inspires no love at all in the millennial heart. To these st Century sprogs, born with a smart phone in their hand, the idea of paying £. a year to the BBC is absurd.Increasingly, it seems absurd to even those of us who fondly remember Bill And Ben, The ­Flowerpot Men. The licence fee is a telly poll tax from another century.The BBC only gets away with raking in a total of £billion a year in licence fees because of the generations who grew up when the BBC was the only show in town.The BBC was extremely foolish to show older ­viewers such wanton ­disrespect. Because now some painfully dficult questions are being asked of the broadcaster.Why does the BBC need to send hundreds of its staff to groove at Glastonbury every year  Does Gary ­Lineker REALLY deserve an eye-watering £,, per annum And why does ANYONE need to pay the licence fee in a world of Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Sky, BT and the infinite ersions of the internet Is there ANY place for a compulsory TV tax  Yes — the last century! The BBC has committed an epic act of self-harm. It was also a crass miscalculation by greedy BBC bosses to announce they were cancelling free TV licences for the over-s just one week after the nation honoured the generation who paid for our liberty with their youth, their blood and their lives.Victor Gregg,  years old, is a former prisoner of war who spoke for the nation. “It’s only days agowere patting all these old people on the head and calling them heroes, this generation which has saved the world,” said Victor.“These are the people now who are over . They’ve lived their le. They’re knackered.”Will the BBC prosecute ­Normandy veterans and their elderly widows for non-payment of the licence fee  Not a great look.And what a sickening prospect that any poor or vulnerable person could be prosecuted for not ­stumping up £. a year to finance the bottomless BBC trough.The BBC’s mugging of the over-s is a wake-up call for us all. This bloated, arrogant corporation has been indulged, protected and bankrolled for too long.The fat cats at the BBC need to tighten their bulging belts. Sky-high salaries need to come down. Grotesque waste — like the annual BBC beano to Glastonbury — has to be cut back.The BBC’s expansionist digital empire needs dialling down. Profligate BBC bosses must start to live within their means. £billion a year is plenty. And, yes, we need to start a national debate about the relevance of the licence fee in the modern world.And above all, the BBC needs to start showing some respect to the older citizens of this country. Because this breaking news just in.Nobody  is watching.JOKING about throwing battery acid in someone’s face is exactly like joking about rape. It will never – and can never – be funny, no matter how much you disagree with the views of the person who is being raped or disfigured by acid.Luckily for Jo Brand, she did not recommend throwing battery acid at a Labour MP or a member of an ethnic community. They would never have let her inside Broadcasting House again.But because Jo only joshed about throwing battery acid at right-wing politicians, her paydays at the BBC are safe.And although Brand was investigated by the police, I suspect the BBC now loves her even more.The comic insists she was joking and would never encourage anyone to throw battery acid at a politician for daring to have views that Jo disagrees with, likewe should possibly respect democracy and leave the EU.What a relief. And I will say this in Jo’s defence – I never saw anyone less likely to throw away a calorie-stuffed milkshake than this cruel, unfunny, virtue-signalling fatberg. Just kidding, Jo!And can we please stop referring to the children abused in Haiti as “prostitutes”  What happened with those girls in Haiti, some as young as  , was not prostitution. It was survival sex.If you are starving in a disaster zone, you do not have sex with a middle-aged charity worker for money. You do it to stay alive.AFTER Michael Gove’s cocaine confession, Boris Johnson was mocked for saying that he was not sure that he actually took the drug.But the scary truth is that nobody ever really knows what they are putting up their nose because this stuff is not regulated.It comes with no list of ingredients. There is no quality control. Cocaine is routinely cut with talcum powder, icing sugar and worse.Anyone who takes “cocaine” might believe they are on the real-deal Bolivian marching power, but you simply never know.It could easily be rat poison you are putting up your hooter. That is why I always warn my children that they should never touch cocaine with a barge pole, or indeed a rolled-up fiver.THE Cannes Film Festival was agog at the sight of ­Vietnamese model Ngoc Trinh, who rocked up to the premiere of A Hidden Le, Terrence Malick’s painfully po-faced film about a conscientious objector in World War Two, wearing a mere rumour of a little black dress.Since ing to Vietnam, Ngoc has been heavily criticised by the Vietnamese government, who have launched an enquiry into whether she violated the country’s public decency laws.“I don’t carepeople criticise it because I felt pretty in the dress, which made a good impression on the Cannes red carpet,” said Ngoc.The Vietnamese authorities should give the girl a break.

He said it was a gun.Davine was then chained up in the dirty pig shed while Bristow went back to his home - where his innocent we and son lived, not knowing his horric secret.But the young woman managed to use discarded hooks in the shed to pick herself out of the shackles.She then grabbed her laptop and Wi stick that Bristow had left in the shed.Sending panicked messages, Davine wrote: I have been kidnapped in South Australia. Please, I’m on a farm somewhere.He drives a red pick-up. Please help look for me. Please, please I’m so afraid.Describing the messages, she said: I described the roads I crossed. Like, went from Murray Bridge, across two ferries.I told them I was taken in a red pickup car, that I’m very scared to run off, that he has a gun.”Fellow backpacker Echo Wang was one of the first to get the messages - immediately alerting Queensland Police.But Davines signal died, meaning she had no ideahelp was coming.She then made the agonising decision to shackle herself up again, and hope police were on their way.South Australian Police had swung into action straight after getting the call for help - using Davines phone signal to start their search.And as Bristow realised what was happening, he fully unchained Davine and drove her back to Murray Bridge, where he checked her into a motel and left.He was ultimately caught by cops - found guilty of one count of aggravated kidnapping, two counts of rape, two counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape during a month-long trial.He was sentenced to  years in jail - not eligible for parole until .It comes after Brit Elisha Greer, , was kidnapped and raped by a man in Australia - driven , miles through the outback with a gun to her head.Drug-crazed Marcus Martin, , repeatedly attacked his young woman - who was only saved when a heroic petrol attendant spotted her black eyes and bruised neck in .He was ultimately jailed for ten years after pleading guilty to three counts of rape and one count of deprivation of liberty.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When Greggs brought out the Vegan Sausage roll I was in heaven.“There are all sorts of places that do vegetarian junk food but for me it’s always been a novelty – my friends were getting a sausage roll when hungover and I couldn’t do that.“I was always quite jealous because it’s so quick and easy and it’s only £- being a vegetarian is so much more expensive, you have to find alternatives.She added: “My favourite one is a Greggs in Salisbury, close to where I live, there is a bench outside - it’s my hangover spot when I go home.My friends think it’s probably the most hilarious thing I’ve ever done in my le.But now Im on a mission."},{"url":null,"title":"furniture maker sweeping factory ban","story":"They insist a broom raises wood dust that can be harmful and want him to fork out for a £, industrial vacuum cleaner to clean up instead.Defiant Michael, , who has used a broom for four decades without any problems, said: “It’s a load of rubbish. My message to the health and safety executives is, ‘Sorry, I’m not doing it. The broom stays’.“I’ve been managing factories for over  years and never have I come across such a joke.“This isn’t something I can choose to do or not do. I’ve been told I have to ban the use of dry sweeping and must confirm with them by a particular date that I’ve complied with their requirements.“If I ignore these guys it will get pretty heavy — but I’m up for the fight. I’m going to pick up my broom and get back to work.”Michael, whose customers include Theresa May, Adele and Brazilian football legend Ronaldo, was stunned when the Health and Safety Executive ordered a broom ban after inspecting his factory in Leyton, East London.They said sweeping sawdust was exposing his ten workers to “a substance hazardous to heath, namely airborne wood dust”.A strongly-worded letter told him to “prohibit” dry-sweeping and “provide evidence of compliance” within weeks.The letter even included a picture of the dangerous broom.Michael was charged £ an hour for the two-hour inspection of his factory earlier this month.He will continue to be charged the whopping hourly rate during his appeal for the time the HSE takes replying to letters.Michael said the problem comes down to the HSE not knowing how to use a broom properly.He added: “They have a nonsense video on their website showing someone using a huge yard broom with stf bristles to sweep up a massive pile of sawdust.“The bristles are too long and they’re lting the broom off the floor, kicking up dust.“Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows brooms should be pushed and kept on the floor. Use a nice short one with soft bristles — just like mine.“Using commercial vacuums means power cables will be running everywhere, no doubt causing a bigger risk than my little old broomstick ever poses. This is the sort of rot that makes companies move manufacturing abroad.”Let’s sweep away this cowardice and get a bit more common sense.The HSE said: “While it is simply not the case that HSE has banned the use of broomsticks, companies are being encouraged to use one of the many safer and more efficient types of equipment where the health of workers is better protected.“Prolonged exposure to high levels of wood dust is known to be one of the direct causes of the high number of cases of occupational asthma and nasal cancer suffered by people in the woodworking industry.Ken Veal, secretary of the British Woodcarvers Association, said: “The concept of not sweeping with a broom is daft.”The first written reference  to witches on broomsticks was in .  Harry Potter famously flies on one  for Quidditch, below.  Angela Lansbury gets airborne the same way in   Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks.In TV’s Only Fools And Horses roadsweeper Trigger claims to have had the same broom for  years.

Her skull had  fractures, her left eye was dislodged from its socket. She lost more than  per cent of her blood, had severe hypothermia and a priest was summoned to the hospital to read the last rites.Within hours, five young black and Hispanic boys were arrested, and four confessed on camera.New Yorkers were horried that their beloved green space had been turned into a hunting ground for violent rapists. Mayor Ed Koch branded the perpetrators “monsters” and a local tycoon named Donald Trump called for their executions.But they were innocent.Now the story of the Central Park Five and their -year fight for justice has been told in Netflix drama series When They See Us.The four-parter, which has earned rave reviews, starts with the fateful night of April , .Trisha, dressed in black leggings and a white T-shirt, left her Upper East Side apartment just before pm.The circular route usually took  minutes, taking her past the politan Museum of Art, then brushing past the much poorer and ethnically erse district of Harlem.The park had fallen into disrepair in the s, suffering from vandalism and neglect. But at the time of the rape the tide was starting to turn after an £million renovation restored landmarks, lawns and gardens.That a -year-old woman felt safe jogging alone through the park at pm is testament to how its reputation had been re-built.But  minutes into her run, Trisha was coshed across the back of her head with a tree branch, dragged  feet into woods and assaulted.Four hours later, builders found her battered body and called the emergency services.Police picked up five Harlem teenagers in connection with a string of assaults carried out in the park in an activity known as “wilding”. These were Yusef Salaam, , Korey Wise, , Antron McCray, , Kevin Richardson,  and Raymond Santana Jr, .They were interrogated for up to  hours, sometimes with no parents present. Yusef later said they had been coerced into confessing, saying: “Police deprived us of food, drink or sleep for more than  hours.”It is claimed the boys were played off against each other, with police telling Raymond Santana that they had evidence against Kevin Richardson and Raymond could go homehe helped them.Yusef added: “As soon as we get in, they separate us and they start working on us. I’m hearing Korey being physically beaten in the next room. I’m immediately beyond afraid.”Raymond said recently: “You got to look at the landscape. You have to look at the fact that we’re , , -year-old kids who had never had involvement with the law, who had no criminal record.“And these are seasoned detectives. So going into that situation, the playing field is already unlevel.”Only the confessions were filmed, not the hours of interviews that led to them. Now  US states require electronic records of full interrogations, after a campaign by the five.But back in  a city riven by racial tension was gunning for justice. Long before he had designs on the White House, Donald Trump took out an advert in four New York news- papers calling for the of the death penalty.In the ad, which did not specically refer to the five, Trump wrote: “I want to hate these murderers and I always will. I am not looking to psychoanalyse or understand them, I am looking to punish them.”After two trials the teens were convicted of offences including attempted murder, rape, assault and robbery. Yusef said later: “I was . My aspirations were to watch The Cosby Show at night and to skateboard. They pointed at me and described me in a matter I could not recognise.”Miraculously, Trisha made an almost complete recovery, barring some problems with balance and loss  of vision. At the time her identity was protected, but in  she wrote a memoir, I Am The Central Park Jogger. She left her job and has since worked with sexual assault victims and as a motivational speaker.In prison, the five were equally determined to reclaim their lives. In  murderer and serial rapist Matias Reyes met Korey Wise when they were both moved to the same jail. The chance encounter, together with finding religion, prompted Reyes to confess to Trisha’s assault.In  he gave police details of the crime which had not been made public, and DNA evidence supported his confession.The convictions of the Central Park Five were overturned and in  they received a settlement payment of £million — though the money cannot erase their mental scars.Antron McCray, , now a dad of six living in Atlanta, Georgia, said: “I’m damaged. It eats me up every day.” Yusef, who has ten children and also lives in Georgia, has devoted his le to fighting for criminal justice reform. In , then-President   Barack Obama honoured him with a Letime Achievement Award.Korey Wise has also turned to activism, donating £, of his settlement to Colorado’s Innocence Project, which campaigns for reforms to the criminal justice system.After his release, Raymond Santana initially ed to prison twice, for a parole violation and for possessing crack cocaine. He has since founded a clothing company.Kevin Richardson, who lives in New Jersey with his we and two children, said: “We always say we have invisible scars nobody sees.“No matter how you cover it, the scab will keep coming off.”In  lawyers for the group called for Trump to apologise, but he refused, even after protesters picketed his New York business headquarters, Trump Tower.When the men received their settlement, Trump wrote in the New York Daily News: “Settling doesn’t mean innocence but it indicates incompetence on several levels.”Actor Joshua Jackson, who plays a lawyer in When They See Us, is outraged at Trump’s part in the tale.He told the Hollywood Reporter magazine: “He was calling for the murder of children. That’s the  President of the United States. The murder of children.”The drama’s director, Ava DuVernay said: “In their journey, we witness five innocent young men of colour who were met with injustice at every turn, from coerced confessions to unjust incarceration to public calls for their execution by the man who would go on to be the President of the United States.”And since When They See Us was released on Netflix on May , Linda Fairstein, the Central Park Five prosecutor — who maintains the confessions were not coerced — has resigned from the board of trustees at New York’s Vassar College and has been dropped by her publisher.There are petitions and social media calls for a boycott of her books.Another prosecutor, Elizabeth Lederer, has resigned as a  professor at Columbia Law School following protests by black students.Finally, after  years, the Five are certainly being seen now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not surprising from ChannelRemain’.”Brexit supporters watching the debate accused Channel  of bias and picking a Remain audience.Junior Brexit minister James Cleverly added: “This Channel  debate is geared up to encourage Conservative leadership candidates to knock chunks out of each other.“That’s not how this campaign should be conducted.“It’s probably good for Channel ’s viewing figures but I’m astonished that so many candidates are playing along.”A spokesman for Channel  denied that the debate audience or set-up had been biased to any one candidate.“Each candidate had a fair opportunity to participate,” the spokesman said.Boris Johnson was blasted by Mr Hunt for dodging the first TV debate of the contest, with Channel  leaving an empty podium for the bookies favourite.In a bid to breathe new le into his campaign, the Foreign Secretary ripped into his opponent for ducking out – and said it highlighted the doubts over his Brexit credentials.He stormed: “If Boris’ team won’t let him out to debate five pretty friendly colleagues, how will he get on with  EU countries ”Aid Secretary Rory Stewart later drew rounds of applause for saying he hoped the next Prime Minister was “one of us” in the room.Boris Johnson’s no show dominated the  minute event –staged on a set that mimicked the TV quiz show ‘Pointless’.But the battle for second place got personal as the remaining five ripped into each other on Brexit and the merits of a No Deal.In a bitter exchange, self-styled Brexit hardman Dominic Raab accused Michael Gove of “buckling” by saying he would accept another delay beyond October . He said: “You would buckle because you’ve shown you would take another extension”.Mr Gove hit back by slamming his supporter in the  leadership contest for threatening to suspend or ‘prorogue’ Parliament altogether to force through a No Deal.Shock leadership candidate Rory Stewart piled in by saying the idea of suspending Parliament was “undemocratic” and “deeply disturbing”.And he mocked his rivals for engaging in a competition of machismo over leaving the EU.But Mr Raab compared the Aid Secretary to Venezuelan socialist dictator Maduro for suggesting he thrash out Brexit with a “citizens assembly” beloved by the left.In another personal barb, Mr Javid – the son a Pakistani immigrant bus driver – launched into the privileged background of his rival candidates.He said: “As well as having the right message, we need to have the right messenger. We need to be a party that has a broad appeal across the country and that means having a messenger that can connect broadly with the whole electorate.”Hitting out at Eton-educated Mr Stewart, he added: “I think I’m the only one on this stage to have gone to a comprehensive school. I went to a college, a further education college - not the sort of college Rory went to.”The debate came  hours before the second round of voting in the contest – and a second debate scheduled for later that evening on the BBC which Mr Johnson has agreed to take part in.Mr Stewart won over the audience with a free-wheeling performance where he once more positioned himself as an outsider.He spoke moving of an  year old constituent forced to care for her  year-old incontinent husband because of the country’s social care crisis as he said there were “,” things a new Prime Minister had to tackle.And he won laughter when he once more compared delivering Brexit to the near-impossible task of “cramming a whole series of rubbish bins” into a larger bin against his we’s advice. He said he wanted to say “believe in the bin, believe in Britain” but knew better.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit Secretary, insisted none of his rivals would get a Brexit deal with the European Union unless they were willing to play hard ball with Brussels. Mr Gove repeated his campaign message that he proved he could deliver against the odds and was “ready to unite, ready to lead”.He opened his pitch by saying: “When Jeremy Corbyn wakes up on a Wednesday morning before Prime Minister’s Questions, who is the person he’s going to be most terried of facing  That’s me.”After struggling early on, Jeremy Hunt said the Government had to appeal to the centre groundit wanted to win a majority.And he warned that while the Tories had been disagreeing over whether to pick a Norwegian or Canadian style Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn had been planning for a Venezuelan or Cuban Britain.After butting heads for more than an hour, the Tory colleagues appeared to try to come back together towards the end of the debate.Mr Hunt launched a passionate defence of Mr Gove over his cocaine shame when the Environment Secretary was challenged whether he could be trusted. Mr Hunt stormed: “When we face a constitutional crisis of the magnitude of Brexit we should not be trivialising the debate by talking about what we did  years ago.”He is on course to win the leadership election, even more so after securing the backing of Cabinet star Matt Hancock.Now is a perfect time for him to set out his policy agenda, his vision for Britain and his plan for how to deliver Brexit in the teeth of a Remainer Parliament.He wants us to take him seriously.

Gordon Spencer, , and we Jackie set sail on a four-month world voyage that would take in their “last two bucket list destinations” - India’s Taj Mahal and seeing the famous cherry blossoms in Japan and. But five weeks after their on January  departure he was dead, after what his family believe was a catalogue of failures at a clinic in Barbados. His case will be highlighted on Thursday by Gordon’s son-in-law, Conservative backbencher Alec Shelbrooke, who will demand a legal shake-up to boost the vetting of doctors in foreign ports visited by cruise liners. Speaking of his “much-cherished father-in-law”, Mr Shelbrooke is expected to tell a Commons adjournment debate how Gordon fell ill - triggering a chain of events which, the family believes, led to his unnecessary death.    The cruise ship’s on-board doctor diagnosed double pneumonia and high blood pressure , beginning treatment with antibiotics. However, when Gordon was taken off the boat in Barbados, a port official sent him to a specialist heart clinic rather than a general hospital. Mr Shelbrooke will claim the ship’s doctor’s notes, which were given to the clinic, “clearly stated Gordon had not had a heart attack”. However, later medical files from the clinic - which the Mirror is not naming for legal reasons - claim he was admitted with double pneumonia and a heart attack, the MP will say. An operation was carried out six days after he arrived, and the family say Gordon’s conditioned quickly worsened. They believe he would have received better and more appropriate treatment at the main hospital nearby. “With a state-of-the-art hospital less than half a mile away in Bridgetown, it is dficult to understand how this clinic was deemed appropriate for offering any level of suitable health care for a critically-ill patient with double pneumonia,” Mr Shelbrooke is expected to add.    The family forked out ,for medical bills and Gordon’s repatriation to the UK. He died on February  in Leeds, “leaving behind a very devastated and traumatised family”. Mr Shelbrooke wants a legal overhaul that would introduce a duty of care on port agents to ensure they carry out “due diligence on the list of medical facilities and practitioners used for passengers disembarked for medical reason at their ports”. Gordon’s daughter Susan - Mr Shelbrooke’s we - said: “My dad was a generous, loving, quick-witted man who worked hard his entire le. “His last major holiday was a world cruise to see the Taj Mahal - a final bucket list destination. “But due to the poor care he received in Barbados we instead laid his ashes there. “My dad was a kind man that cared greatly about other people’s welfare. “I know that highlighting what happened to him is a fitting tribute to a man who would have wanted to do everything he could to stop other people suffering the same fate.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa launches last bid legacy","story":"NewsTheresa May launches last bid for a legacy with reforms for young mental healthThe plans will involve training every new teacher in how to spot the signs of mental health issues in the youngShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  JUN NewsTheresa May pledged better access to education, help and support as part of a crusade for tackling mental illness \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Every new teacher will be trained in how to spot the signs of kids’ mental health problems, under plans unveiled by Theresa May today as she bids to secure her legacy.In the latest announcement from No as the Prime Minister prepares to quit Downing Street, she pledged better access to education, help and support as part of a crusade for tackling mental illness.

Boris Johnson may be the runaway first place in the Tory leadership race, but itaposs not over yet. And after he shamelessly chickened out of last nightaposs Channel  TV debate, his rivals have had some much-needed airtime.You can read our special round-up of last nightaposs debate here. But what does the rest of the week hold Hereaposs a guide to why you need to keep your eyes peeled for news about our future.  By Friday, Tory MPs will have whittled down the six candidates for Prime Minister to just two - who then go to a vote by , Tory members. MPsapos next knockout vote is announced at pm tomorrow, with any MP with fewer than  backers kicked out. There are then further knockout rounds eliminating the least popular candidate each time at pm Wednesday, pm Thursday and pm Thursday. Meanwhile thereaposs a hustings by Westminster journalists from am today and a BBC debate between all fiveremaining candidates at pm tomorrow. Boris Johnsonaposs Tory leadership bid has received a new boost with the backing of failed candidate Matt Hancock.The Health Secretary, who threw in the towel on Friday, has now rallied despite the most likely winner of the contest. He claimed Mr Johnson will be a pro-enterprise PM - despite attacking Mr Johnsonaposs infamously sweary on business just three weeks ago. During the campaign Mr Hancock said: To the people who say aposf*** businessapos, I say aposf***, f*** business!apos Yet today he claimed Mr Johnson will unite the country behind an open, ambitious, forward-looking agenda, delivered with the energy that gets stuff done. It is far from clear the  MPs who backed Mr Hancock in the first round will swing to Boris Johnson. But it does leave him more likely to keep a Cabinet job. It means Boris Johnson looks even more on course to win the contest despite avoiding proper scrutiny . Today he uses his £,-a-week Dailycolumn to announce heaposd extend full-fibre broadband to every home in the country by within five years, nine years ahead of the Governmentaposs  target. A fast internet connection is not some metropolitan luxury. It is an indispensable tool of modern le, he writes.  Shameless coward Boris Johnson snubbed the first TV debate of the Tory leadership race last night. Channel  - which hosted the debate - left a humiliating empty podium for the chicken contender. And today it appears heaposs planning a repeat performance. The contender is the only one of six candidates NOT to confirm heaposll attend a hustings by Westminster journalists. The hustings is taking place in Parliament between .am and .pm. Slots are still free for Boris Johnson in case he has a last-minute change of heart. The Mirror Chicken was out in force at last nightaposs Channel  debate demanding Mr Johnson faces the music. . The second spot is still all to play for  Last nightaposs debate left no clear winner in the race to be the aposstop Borisapos candidate.Dominic Raab looks destined to fail as MPs rounded on his dictatorial threat to shut Parliament to ram through a No Deal Brexit . But despite having dferent Brexit plans there was little clear water between Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Rory Stewart and Sajid Javid.Each of their Brexit plans has known drawbacks and none of them are widely considered to have the sparkle to win the affections of Tory members. Rory Stewart was the most popular with the crowd last night and announced a new backer, Paul Masterton, this morning. But his vehement opposition to No Deal Brexit means heaposs unlikely to ever win the Tory membership.  Boris Johnson -  MPs Jeremy Hunt -  Michael Gove -  Dominic Raab -  Sajid Javid -  Matt Hancock -  Rory Stewart - KNOCKED OUT :Andrea Leadsom -  Mark Harper -  Esther McVey -   Boris Johnsonaposs team has been forced to deny heaposs planning an early general election after comments he made on Saturday. The frontrunner said he would get Brexit done and get ready for an election, it is reported. Evenhe did mean in , he may well have no choice. Yesterday Amber Rudd, who backs Jeremy Hunt, warned the numbers are easily there for Tory MPs to bring down a Johnson government - forcing an election.All it would take would be for a cluster of hard Remainers to join Labour in a no confidence vote in the government.She told the BBC: There are number of colleagues who have gone public saying they would consider doing that. And there are a number I know of privately who say that, so any candidate needs to factor that in as well into their strategy for the next few months.” Alarmingly, thetoday reports that Tory donors have opened talks with Nigel Farage about an electoral pact to not stand Brexit Party and Tory candidates against each other. A source close to the talks told the newspaper they were very preliminary, adding you have to get Boris on board and that is going to be very tricky. Boris Johnson ally James Cleverly played down talk of a pact today but didnapost rule one out. He said Mr Johnson didnapost make pacts as Mayor of London so I canapost imagine he will do so now.

But the frontrunner wasnapost there after Boris Johnson shamelessly chickened out of the Channel  showdown. Without him there, the contenders to be the stop Boris candidate clashed over everything from Brexit to schools and the NHS. Barring a massive upset, only one of Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid or Rory Stewart will go up against Mr Johnson in a vote by Tory members. And weaposll know who that is by Thursday as MPs whittle down the candidates from six to two later this week. So what were the highlights from tonightaposs -minute debate and what did we learn  Here are  things you need to know - and our ratings of how the candidates fared.  Chicken Boris Johnson snubbed the first TV debate of the Tory leadership race tonight. The flapping former Foreign Secretary who wants to be Prime Minister clucked off rivals by refusing to attend the -minute televised showdown. And Channel  - which hosted the debate - left a humiliating empty podium for the contender. Speaking moments before the debate kicked off, host Krishnan Guru-Murthy said there was still time for Mr Johnson to get a taxi from North London.  Jeremy Hunt unleashed a brutal attack, asking the audience: “We have been talking about Brexit for  minutes now and where is Boris  “If his team won’t allow him out to debate with five pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to fare with  European countries  “He should be here to answer that very question.”  With five suited men with a high opinion of themselves the contest already resembled The Apprentice. And it plunged into a cringeworthy replica of the BBC show when the candidates were asked to name their greatest weakness. Predictably they mostly tried to choose attributes that other people think are actually good. And boy, it backfired. Michael Gove had the reddest face after he claimed it was impatience because heaposs a man in a hurry. Host Krishnan Guru-Murthy instantly turned the tables by askingit was hypocrisy - since Gove admitted using cocaine despite preaching against drugs. Mr Gove replied: I made a mistake... We’re all frail and faulty. If you’ve… fallen short of high standards, you don’t lower the standards, you reflect on your mistake. Mr Raab said he was restless to build a fairer society - but he too had the tables turned on him when Mr Guru-Murthy asked why heaposd called feminists obnoxious bigots. In a bizarre comeback for a politician, whose job involves, erm, SAYING things in Parliament, Mr Raab said: Judge us by what we do, not just what we say. Mr Stewart at least admitted having a lot of weaknesses, including being prone to changing his mind. And Mr Javid admitted he was very stubborn and added: If you want to be prime minister you need to be ready to listen.  With his furious opposition to No Deal Brexit , Rory Stewart seems unlikely to make the final two candidates. But he lapped up support from some vocal members of the Channel  audience who repeatedly applauded him. And because he had the most distinct , the International Development Secretary stood out the most. In one highlight he accused his rivals of engaging in a “competition of machismo” - to applause from the audience. Everyone’s like - ‘trust me, I’m going to do it, I’m the guy, I’m going defeat impossible odds, he said. He said it reminded him of when he tried to “cram a whole series of rubbish bins” into a larger bin against his we’s advice.  He said he wanted to say “believe in the bin, believe in Britain” but knew better. Mr Stewart added: “It’s nonsense!”  Four years after his battle with junior doctors, Jeremy Hunt finally showed some remorse. In fact, he was more or less the only candidate to give a decent answer to the question of his greatest weakness. He said: “As Health Secretary I did have some very stubborn battles. “And in particular in the battle I had with the junior doctors, I don’t think I was as good at communicating my vision as I should have been. “They are wonderful people and that is the thing I learned from that. Be better at communicating what you want to do.” To doctors who only last week won a breakthrough in their battle over -day contracts, this may well not be enough.  There was a surprising moment when candidate Michael Gove sprang to the defence of Sajid Javid. It happened when the conversation turned to Donald Trumpaposs state banquet during his visit to the UK this month - to which Mr Javid wasnapost invited. Mr Guru-Murthy asked whether not being a big enough figure was his weakness. Michael Gove chimed in: Oh, that is ridiculous!... Heaposs a big figure. Heaposs come from the background he has to achieve so much. He doesnapost need an American President to recognise heaposs an amazing guy. Mr Javid said pointedly: I donapost think that was the reason I wasnapost invited to the dinner. I donapost know what it was, but I said earlier on this stage, Iaposve been used to being an outsider my whole le. Earlier, Mr Javid admitted he “knows what it’s like” to walk into a room as an “outsider” when he was askedBritain was ready for a PM with Pakistani heritage. He added: “The country is ready for anyone to be PM as long as they have the experience and talent to do the job.”  Tory leadership rivals rounded on Dominic Raab over the possibility of proroguing parliament - to stop MPs blocking a no deal Brexit . Four candidates savaged the former Brexit Secretary as a “dictator” over his threat to lock the doors of the Commons to ensure MPs canapost vote on the prospect. The hard Brexiteer said: “I don’t think it’s likely but it’s not illegal.” But the audience cheered rival Rory Stewart as he branded the plan “undemocratic, deeply disturbing” and saying it “strikes at the heart of our constitution”. Joining the attack, Mr Gove said: “I will defend our democracy - and you cannot take Britain out of the EU against the will of Parliament.” Mr Hunt said shutting Parliament would be a “profound mistake” and “wrong”, while Mr Javid also ruled it out. Mr Raab hit back by saying Mr Stewart’s idea to let , ordinary people sort out Brexit through a “citizens’ assembly” was the “Venezuelan option”.  Itaposs telling that all five candidates claimed they can succeed in renegotiating Brexit, in some way, where Theresa May failed. And yet, they were attacking each othersapos plans as unworkable. Sound familiar  Most said they would accept a No Deal situationit was a choice between that and no Brexit at all. Yet even Mr Raab, the hardest Brexiteer on the ticket, said he would ask the EU to renegotiate - asking them to agree the ‘Malthouse compromise’, a high-tech plan for the Irish border that has been panned by critics. He claimed: “I’m the only one I believe who can be trusted to get us out by the end of October.” Wearing a Union flag pin badge, Jeremy Hunt admitted: “Four people here are saying ‘we have to renegotiate a deal’ that will not go through parliament.” But he also claimed it would be “fundamentally pessimistic” to claim you can’t negotiate anything at all new with the EU. Michael Gove said he “believed in Brexit” adding in a reference to his fallout with David Cameron: “I put everything on the line, friendships and family, to be able to argue for it.” Iaposm saying I can get the European Union to change their approach, he said. He said we cannot leave unless Parliament votes for it and, addressing Mr Raab, he said no deal could not be pushed through against the will of Parliament. Said Javid added: “The number one mistake that was made was not properly preparing for No Deal.” Meanwhile Dominic Raab hit back at Rory Stewart by saying his option - calling up , ordinary Brits to sort out Brexit through a “citizens’ assembly” - was the “Venezuelan option”. It all means we could be facing more deadlock come October .

We learned some of their OTHER prioritiesBrexit is ever over An audience member asked what candidates thought was the most urgent issue beyond Brexit that Britain needs to address. Mr Raab said he wanted to improve the opportunities for young people and increase state school standards, offer more choices for young apprenticeships for  to -year-olds, and create non-graduate routes into professions like law. Mr Hunt said he wants to turbo-charge the British economy and bolster the social care system. Mr Gove said children were the priority, particularly those growing up in poverty. We need to make sure they have the opportunities that all of us enjoyed, he said. The Government should look at the way in which tuition fees are levied, he said. Mr Stewart said adult social care was his top priority, adding: Itaposs a real disgrace, itaposs the great unfinished revolution of our society. Mr Javid said public services - with a focus on education - were his priority and he relied on them to rise to his position.  A man was spotted theatrically mouthing bollocks to Brexit in the audience for tonightaposs Tory leadership debate. The hilarious moment was captured and broadcast live to the nation on Channel . A young man, wearing a Tommy Hilfiger t-shirt and glasses, made the silent pronouncement from the back row of the audience.

It sees a mystery youngster unleash a rocket from just inside her own half, which wrong-foots the boy in the opposition net and flies in. But what caught our eye was the looks of utter shock on the faces of the boys who canapost quite believe what has happened. Football has the power to change lives - but moments like this prove it’s not just the players at the top of the game who are making a dference.  It’s on the local parks and playing fields where le-changing moments are happening everyday, right across the UK.  Since , players of The National Lottery have raised £billion for good causes, with over £ million being used to support grassroots football initiatives. That’s money that has been raised by you. For every ticket sold, a slice of the money received goes to a huge iety of projects, big and small.  From building new football venues, to inspiring future generations to participate, projects like these have helped thousands of people improve their lives, and made Britain’s communities a better place to live and work.  It’s thanks to National Lottery funding that young players like -year-old Charlie Fryhas found a route into football - despite his disability. Charlie was devastated when he was told he was unable to play mainstream football after being diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome seven years ago.  Then his mother Rachel and father Lee discovered Team United, a Scottish-based charity which has received National Lottery funding and offers young players with disabilities a route back into the game.

The coaches there can read his body language, and understand it. They know how to coach children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. “He’s now back playing mainstream football with Bathgate Thistle Whites  and they won West Lothian County Cup final last year, with Charlie being voted the team’s player of the year.” Another youngster to benefit is Sophie Brett , who has been able to turn her le around thanks to National Lottery funding.  The -year-old battled PTSD and turned to self-harming after a dficult childhood saw her taken into foster care.

We have thousands of stories to tell about the amazing things that are happening thanks to National Lottery funding.  “It’s great to shine a spotlight on the funding of local football projects and the positive impact it has on iniduals and communities.” Over the past  years more than , projects have been funded across the UK - the equivalent of around  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district.

Thomas McKell, from Glagsow, Scotland, made the desperate request because the MRSA bug that had eaten the skin and muscle behind his knee could not be treated.The former joiner, who has multiple sclerosis, is now unable to move his legs and is stuck in a foetal position in hospital, the Daily Record reports.Thomas, who has been fighting MRSA for the last four years, and his mum Pauline, , shared shocking pictures of him in hospital in a bid to get help for him. She said: “At one point, it was so bad, he said he wanted them to amputate his legs.”    “Thomas is severely disabled with MS and we just don’t know where to turn to. “We have been shoved from pillar to post and things just seem to get worse. He’s such a poor soul. “He was diagnosed with MS in his s. He used to be fit and active.He loved football and supported  Celtic  and even went to see them in Seville. He used to work as a joiner and was always on the go.“For four years, they have been cleaning the wound on his leg but it never seems to get any better. “It’s heartbreaking. We’re now told he has a category four MRSA wound. He is in a terrible state and even the plastic surgeon was shocked when he saw it. We just don’t know what to do for him.    “Surely someone shouldn’t just be left like this in this day and age ” Dad-of-two Thomas, , is stuck in the foetal position because of muscle wastage causing his legs to retract. He may have to have the tendons cut in his legs to allow them to be straightened. Health chiefs insist he is getting the right treatment and they promised to meet his family to discuss his care. But Pauline is appalled by his physical and mental state.    Thomas was treated in Glasgow Royal Infirmary but is now a patient in the city’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Pauline, who also has MS, said they are still waiting for test results on his leg wound. Her comments on Thomas’s plight come after a Scottish hospital was investigated over the care of a multiple sclerosis patient stuck in the foetal position for more than two years. Former reservist soldier Billy Barclay, , was moved from Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride – where he had been trapped because a care home place couldn’t be found. His daughter Barbara said he received much better care at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. But staff there discovered he had two fractures and a serious infection.

It is just one thing after another and everything seems to take so long to happen. Why does it have to be like that  “I am disgusted. He just needs help.” Labour and Co-operative MP for Glasgow North East Paul Sweeney is backing the family. He said: “These pictures of Thomas are extremely distressing and I can only imagine how his family feel looking on helplessly as he suffers. This comes amid ongoing questions about a chronic lack of resources and understaffing at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. “Whatever has happened up to this point it is important that the McKell family are given assurances that someone has taken ownership of Thomas’s future care and I will support them in ensuring that happens. A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “We are sorry to hear that this woman is unhappy with her son’s care. “We would like to reassure her that he is receiving the appropriate medical treatment and nursing care. “We are arranging to meet with this patient’s family to ensure they are kept informed about all aspects of his care and are given the opportunity to discuss any concerns they have.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girl 11 faces three hour","story":"NewsGirl, , faces THREE HOUR round trip to sixth-choice secondary schoolPhoebe Smith was the only one from her junior school selected to go to John Willmott High School, according to her mumShareCommentsByZoe Chamberlain:,  JUN NewsJoanne Smith from Roughley and her  year old daughter Phoebe \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn -year-old girl will spend more than three hours a day travelling to and from secondary school in the new academic year. Phoebe Smith has been offered a place at her sixth choice secondary school with travel one way taking roughly an hour and  minutes. Her mum says she only added John Willmott secondary school in Sutton Coldfield to her application because the online system would not accept the form unless all the boxes were filled in.But she was stunned when she found Phoebe had been handed a place there, reports Birmingham Live.The Smith family live in Roughley which is much closer to her first choice, Arthur Terry in Four Oaks.  And mum Joanne cannot drive her to school because of injuries she suffered in a crash caused by a drink-driver who was later jailed. Phoebe would have to leave home at am and catch two buses to make the journey to John Willmott in an estimated hour and  minutes - and perform the reverse trip at the end of school. Joanne said her daughter was the only child from her junior school offered a place at John Willmott. Two of Phoebeaposs older sisters went to Arthur Terry and she already attends after-school clubs there, while she could either walk to classes with friends or take a lt with relatives working at the secondary. But Phoebe is a victim of the schoolaposs popularity, which has seen it regularly over-subscribed in recent years. Mum-of-five Joanneaposs appeal against the decision was rejected by Birmingham City Council and she has refused her daughteraposs place at John Willmott, leaving them in limbo for the new school year.    “Phoebe is the sole child from her school to be offered a place at John Wilmott,” she said. “She’s so upset she has been having panic attacks and feels like she is losing her friends. “If she went to Arthur Terry, she could walk with her friends in around  minutes.” Phoebe is currently number  on the waiting list for Arthur Terry.  Based on Kittoe Road,, it is just over one-and-a-half miles from her home on the Harvest Fields estate. John Willmott, on Reddicap Heath Road, is . miles away and she would have to make a -minute walk alone on unlit paths which Joanne does not feel is safe. She is number  on the list for her second choice, Plantsbrook School. And there is another, heartbreaking reason why Phoebe does not want to go to John Willmott. “Phoebe’s -year-old sister was a witness to the Ozell Pemberton stabbing in the centre of Sutton Coldfield in May last year, Joanne said. “There are still gangs around there and none of my daughters want to go anywhere near Sutton Coldfield town centre as a result. “Phoebe would have to catch the bus in and out of the town centre every day to get to John Willmott.  “If she was to walk, it would be on unlit paths and she is scared to do this.” Joanne said the online application system would not accept her form unless she filled in all six spaces. “I never thought for a moment that I would be given my sixth place,” added Joanne, who worked as a prison custody officer at Birmingham Crown Court before her accident. “Phoebe’s grandmother and auntie work at Arthur Terry and her cousins go there. She already goes to after-school clubs at the school. “Her older sisters, now aged  and , also went there so we know it really well.”  For the last six years, Phoebe has been on the SENregister and receiving one to one support. She has just been diagnosed with severe dyslexia. John Willmott came out of special measures in January  but Joanne is concerned her daughteraposs SEN needs would not be fully addressed there. The appeal board told Joanne there was no space for Phoebe at Arthur Terry despite the family formally appealing. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: “If people are not happy with their preferences given then they are entitled to appeal.

James is banned from buying flowers or perfume for Laura, and even cooking his girlfriend a meal could end in disaster.    Instead, caring James shows his affection for Laura by vacuuming the house from top to bottom every day and dusting every nook and cranny to stop his other half from having a horric allergic reaction. Once the house is spotlessly clean, the pair can snuggle up on the sofa together to watch a film - as long as James isnapost wearing any aftershave or deodorant that could trigger Lauraaposs allergies. Laura, a former customer service worker, said: Itaposs affected my le in just about every way. If we go on a weekend away we canapost stay in a hotel because Iaposm allergic to the materials in the linen. If we want to go on a date, weaposre very restricted to where we can go for food. Going out in a crowd can be a problem because any fumes or deodorant people are wearing could set me off.    It makes me feel pretty rubbish, I feel useless to my family, useless to James. If itaposs too hot or cold I canapost go out. The longest Iaposve had to stay in the house for has been nearly two weeks. Laura, who was born with the condition, has spent a letime applying seven dferent types of cream to her body in order to keep the crippling eczema at bay. When Laura and James go on holiday they canapost stay in a hotel because Laura could have a reaction to the bed linen. Laura has to buy a new pair of pyjamas and bed sheets each month because they become drenched in her ious creams that stop her skin from cracking.    Her skin will flare up evensheaposs exposed to the smallest amount of perfume or deodorant andthe temperature of a room is too high she gets massive red rashes. The couple, who have been in a relationship for over two years, have said that they have made their relationship work despite Lauraaposs condition and have adapted their home to Lauraaposs needs. Laura said: Being with James has changed my confidence and how Iaposve seen myself over the last two years but that doesnapost change the fact that I hate the way I look. We sometimes go to the cinema because itaposs nice and safe but we try and go when itaposs quiet so no one will sit next to me and set me off.    When we go out we have to take out all the creams in a bag. We only go to the pubs and eat the same safe food that we know as itaposs not worth the risk. James said: Itaposs been a bit tricky at times and weaposve had to change things around the house. We have to make sure the house is cleaned properly. I tend to hoover the whole house top to bottom every other day and have to dust the house the whole day. Everyone has body issue images and it does get in the way sometimes. Despite everything and the challenges we face, Iaposm so proud of Laura and love her just the way she is.

Initially treating it as a joke, Kaitlyn said she later become worried when her voice failed toafter two months.    The -year-old said the realities of working in a noisy bar job without her speaking voice became too much to bear.“I was trying so hard to get out what I wanted to say and I knew that people couldn’t hear it so it wasn’t their fault, but I was just getting frustrated over the whole thing,” Ms Grace told Yahoo News .“I remember crying to my mum, saying that I was never going to have my voice back, and never going to be the way I was before.

park","story":"A group dedicated to saving a historic park building hopes to present a business plan to Aberdeen City Council within weeks.The Save Westburn House Action Grouphopes to turn the dilapidated building at Westburn Park into a community hub and cafe.The facility would include a range of activities, projects and services aimed at improving health, social, cultural, educational, environmental and employment-related facilities for the community.It is also hoped it will bring more people into the park, both during the day and night all year round.Gavin Esslemont, chairman of SWHAG, said: “We’ve been in constant conversations with the council to be able to take the building over.“We’ve had some really positive talks and face-to-face meetings.“We’re working on a business plan and hope to have it by the end of next month.“We’ve carried out a community engagement exercise to see what people want and we got -plus responses on that survey.“It’s a huge project. We’re trying to put the building back to the way it was.”Since launching, the group has had a huge amount of support from members of the public and people have come forward to lend a hand.Work will be carried out in several phases, with a new roof installed first.The longer the building is left roofless, the more damage will be caused to the structure.Once the roof is fixed, work will move onto the second stage of getting the building back up to scratch.Restoration, which will involve the bulk of the internal work, is expected to cost a signicant sum, with a fundraising event planned for later on in the year.Gavin added: “We’re trying not to spend money where we don’t have to. We’re not going to have full plans, including where sockets are going to go, but we will have an outline to discuss.“A lot of professionals have come forward and we’re really lucky. If we’re going to do it, we want to do it right.“We want to engage people into the building. It’s a great green space and Rosemount is very densely populated.“We’re certainly trying to engage people into the park all year round.”As part of its drive, campaign bosses also got Robert Gordon University students on board to come up with ways to stem the decline of the building.They were tasked with developing a D model of the building which is hoped will assist with restoration plans when it gets to that stage.Gavin added: “We’re not trying to reinvent the wheel. What they have done is essentially what we wanted to do.“We’re going with the status quo, we’re not looking to deviate too radically.“It’s quite a big building, and there’s a lot to do with it.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"plans to convert aberdeen office into flat approved","story":"Plans to convert an Aberdeen city centre business into a flat have been given the green light.Aberdeen City Council approved the plans at the end of last week, which will see the George Street space converted from a class two property, which has been home to a financial business.In a decision notice issued by the authority, the flat is considered to be compliant with the local development plan, which aims to bring more residential properties into the city centre.Developers were asked to provide bike storage as a condition."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.28069208-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"revamp planned for aberdeen streets","story":"Ambitious designs drawn up to improve the Tillydrone and Woodside areas will be showcased at an event later this month.Designs were created to help reduce traffic on Hayton Road and Don Street and enhance public spaces in the area.Members of the public have now been invited to view the proposals at an event on Wednesday June .Aberdeen City Council transport spokeswoman Sandra Macdonald said: “We are delighted the designs for these ambitious proposals have been finalised and would like to say a big thank you to those involved, particularly the local residents who have so enthusiastically taken part in the process.”People can drop in anytime between  and pm to view the exhibits and ask questions at St George’s Church.New designs show possible future for Aberdeen community\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local new-designs-show-possible-future-for-aberdeen-community embed # secretdolOjcO\" data-secret\"dolOjcO\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/DSC05051-846x564.jpg ","title":"hollywood comes to glasgow again as filming starts in govan for steven spielbergs 1917","story":"A disused dockyard in Govan will be the latest part of Glasgow to star in a Hollywood blockbuster.Filming has begun in the area for World War One epic , which is being produced by Steven Spielberg and is slated for release in December this year. vw, px\"  It is being directed by Sam Mendes, who was spotted on site today, in his first project since James Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.A number of roads around the site have been closed off, and fences put up as shooting begins.On the other side of the river, in the SEC car park, a number of trailers and cabins for cast and crew have been set up.Earlier today, gunshots could be heard ringing out around the set. vw, px\"  The film has a stellar cast including Scots star Richard Madden.Also set to star in the film are Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Colin Firth and Andrew Scott.It is unclearany of the big name actors will be shooting scenes in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next.

This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize.

Hot on their heels, Mid Argyll Community Pool is moving from plastic bottles to refills.Jilly Wilson of the Square Peg said: #I was aware of the number of plastic bottles of water we sold and it seemed such a waste.

It was recommended that for approval.A report for the meeting, prepared by executive director of development and infrastructure Pippa Milne said: #Officers are of the view that the primary benefit to the council in having this site designated as a Centenary Fields site is more in the symbolic sense – that the site is officially recognised by both Fields in Trust and the Royal British Legion as space to be protected for future generations to enjoy.#[It would also be] to commemorate those servicemen and women, as well as civilians, who played their part in the First World War.#There may also be the opportunity to use Centenary Fields status to help lever in external funding for the site.#Every site receives a commemorative plaque to display on site, as well as receiving associated signage, the display of which is optional. There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful meal accompanies swi agm","story":"President Jean Ives welcomed the members to the tearoom where Frances Hill provided the sustenance.The formal business included a review of the previous year’s events in which Southend#s SWI excelled, winning several events including bowls and a quiz.After a very successful year, the winter competitions# winner was Alison Eynon, who received the trophy, with Jen Ronald second and Fiona Rowland third.The retiring committee of Jean Ives, Fiona Rowland and Trish Jones were thanked for their hard work over the previous three years.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-the-food-has-lots-going-for-it-but-it-needs-to-put-taste-before-appearance","story":"Same story as usual: dishes come in random order, at the whim of the kitchen. This is becoming a convention in small plates restaurants. Increasingly it irks me. You end up eating, say, cold cucumber after hot meat, a system that suits the kitchen, not the diner.

The young Tsar is depicted wearing the mantle of a ruler and the armour of a warrior, looking to the west seemingly in the hope of establishing a new, lsquoopenrsquo Russia.Another is the coronation portrait of Catherine the Great. Painted by Vigilius Eriksen it shows the new Empress in a bold statement of magnicence and power at a time when Russia was established as one of the great powers in Europe and was seeking the best of British ideas and skills to deliver aspects of the Enlightenment to Russia.The cultural exchange led to Scottish architect Charles Cameron creating two of the finest th-century palaces in Russia, at Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk, and saw a raft of Jacobite sympathisers who had left Scotland after the failed  uprising take prominent positions within the Russian navy and army.Stephen Patterson, one of the two curators of the exhibition, says the letter signed by Peter the Great and sent to the Old Pretender is particularly intriguing.ldquoFor a start, it is quite unusual to have a letter with his signature, he says. ldquoHe is very diplomatic and says very little except that he had discussed these matters, but he makes no commitments in any direction. It is a very well-honed letter written at a time when everyone is hedging their bets.The letter is believed to have been written in response to a call from the Prince to support the Stuart cause following the failed rebellions in  and , and carefully stored until it could be used in their favour.ldquoIn  Peterrsquos daughter was on the throne as the result of a palace coup, adds Mr Patterson. ldquoThe Stuarts dug out the letter and made sure it was sent back to Elizabeth to remind her that her father had been in conversation with the Jacobites, and therefore supporting the legitimate monarchy and dynasty was a good thing.ldquoThey were praising her for restoring the succession and the Petrine line. They were hoping that as a result of them showing Elizabeth that there had been this conversation with her father, she would be on their side supporting them against the Hanoverians.The exhibition also includes a gt to Alexander I of a biography of Colonel James Gardiner, who was slain fighting on the Hanoverian side against the Jacobites at the Battle of Prestonpans in . While among the most enthralling of exhibits is a series of photographs taken in  in St Petersburg and Moscow at the time of Alexander IIrsquos coronation. Captured by Irish photographer James Mack, they are among the earliest known photographs of Russia and show the cities at a unique period before revolution would alter the nationrsquos political landscape forever.The photographs include a rather bizarre image of a man in full Highland dress standing on floating logs on the river Moskva accompanied by two Muscovites, while images taken by Scottish photographer William Carrick, who opened a studio in St Petersburg in , show Russiarsquos lower classes and folkloric rural scenes.The exhibition explores the connection between the royal families during the Napoleonic wars, with victory celebrated in a series of portraits of leading Russian military leaders which recognise Russiarsquos contribution to the victory and were commissioned for the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle.Alongside grand are intimate gts and personal objects shared between the royals as links between the families strengthened following a string of marriages which connected the British, Russian and Danish royal houses.The most recent is an oil painting by Russian post-Impressionist Igor Grabar which was presented to the Queen by Nikita Khrushchev and Premier Nikolai Bulganin during a visit to London in .The exhibition, which runs at the Palace of Holyroodhouse from June  until November, was among the most successful of its kind to be shown at Buckingham Palace.Mr Patterson added: ldquoThe exhibition brings together a group of material hitherto never seen together.

Edinburgh has long had a good relationship with Disney-Pixar, often being given first look at new releases. This time, Toy Story was early for the party, with the festival proper not starting till Wednesday.

We are not selecting a dictator of our countryhellipldquoTo suggest you would suspend Parliament and put an end to our sovereign democracy to suit some goal to implement democracy is not right, insisted the Home Secretary.In, at times, passionate exchanges, Mr Stewart told his four colleagues they were engaging in a ldquobattle of machismo in trying to sound toughest on Brussels when they knew that a no-deal outcome was not deliverable because Parliament would block it.\"They think they are threatening something but a threat is not credible unless it can be delivered,\" insisted the Scot.Mr Javid hit back, saying it was a \"complete nonsense\" to take away the threat of no-deal although he acknowledged not enough had been done to prepare for it.\"The number one mistake that was made was not planning for no-deal. I have never walked into a room without the ability to walk away without signing,\" he stressed.Mr Hunt said the next PM had to be prepared to sit down and negotiate with Brussels to get a better deal than that negotiated by Theresa May.\"It is fundamentally pessimistic to say we cannot do that,\" he declared.Mr Gove said that he had the experience to renegotiate the controversial Northern Ireland backstop which proved the key stumbling block to getting the PMrsquos deal through Parliament.\"I would ensure we have a full stop to the backstop,\" he said.Mr Raab, who quit as Brexit secretary over Mrs Mays agreement, said that as a committed Brexiteer he could be relied on to deliver Brexit.\"I am the candidate most trusted to get us out of the EU by the end of October,\" he said.Candidates were also asked about their greatest weakness.Mr Gove said \"impatience\" before host Krishnan Guru-Murthy askedit was hypocrisy, mentioning his recent admission to using cocaine.\"I made a mistake. I learnt from my mistake,\" insisted the Secretary of State.Mr Raab said he was restless, while Mr Stewart admitted having \"a lot of weaknesses\", including being prone to changing his mind.Mr Javid admitted he was \"very stubborn\" and added: \"If you want to be prime minister you need to be ready to listen.\"Mr Hunt drew on the junior doctor scandal when he was Health Secretary, saying he could \"be better at communicating what you want to do\".Today, journalists at Westminster will quiz the candidates but, again, Mr Johnson is not expected to attend, while all six are set to appear before an MPsrsquo hustings.Tomorrow, Mr Johnson will appear in the BBCrsquos live debate alongside his fellow contenders following the second vote, which will eliminate at least one more candidate.

There are plans to undertake another capital raise, also this year.:Scots firm in link-up to energy councilThe technology, first tested in Glasgow, centres on the Faraday Exchanger, a new type of router replacement that can temper the flow of power at an inidual point or be used alongside others to enhance a wider grid.This model makes the equipment affordable and the idea achievable, he says.\"In essence, the energy system is changing, so we know that we changed the way were generating energy moving away from these large fossil fuel plants and hub-and-spoke model to distribute iable energy as well.\"So, we are changing the way we use energy, weve got more electric vehicles, a lot more digital consumption.\"Mr Williams, above, said: \"But the grid that connects all of these things together, all of these endpoints, hasnt fundamentally changed in over  years.\"The basis is still poles, wires, transformers and as the systems get more complex what were doingis were adding more and more technology into the system to try and counteract the issues that were experiencing as it grows.\"So, we see our technology as a  to enable us to have this future that we want where we can have more renewable energy, we can have electric vehicles and were able to deliver all of these things whilst maintaining the reliability of the grid.\"We want it to be green, be clean, thats really important for the environment and its really important that energy stays cheap as well.\"The challenge that in one sense were facing, I think it was coined by the World Energy Council, the energy trilemma, which is how do you have affordable, reliable and decarbonised energy systems.\"Faraday Grid is an important part of that.\"Our technology provides a new base layer for the energy system, so we still need the same poles and wires, weve got such a large system that we cant redo it from scratch.\":Edinburgh energy firm sets up in Czech RepublicHe says:\"But we make it more flexible, more robust, so we can do all of these things in the future.\"So we can have more renewables, we can have all these dferent technologies come on, which, at the moment, theyre unable to deliver as much value as they could because the electricity grid itself is an old, passive, rigid system.\"Faraday Grid turns their old system into something a lot smarter and more flexible.\"He compares the upgrade of the world electrical energy system to evolution of telephony.\"It can bring affordable electricity to areas that might have struggled to maintain infrastructure and balance energy production and provision.\"I always think of it like we have the old telephone system, which was copper wires and telephone switches and we were able to replace those switches with routers, and all of a sudden those same copper wires became the internet.\"He said: \"It is similar. We have this old electricity grid and were able to replace existing devices within the electricity grid, in this case transformers, with Faraday Exchangers, which are like the router for the internet of electricity.\"We can literally take out one single transformer which needs to be replaced anyway.\"They are reaching end of le and we can put in one Faraday Exchanger, which can do everything a transformer does, but it does so much more.\"Its able to control the voltage, remove all the noise from the signal.\"We can control the power factor to balance across all these phases and we do it all within a single device.\"All of a sudden youre not having to add all this extra complexity into the network and you get this really nice  that enables double the amount of renewable energy onto the system.\"It reduces losses, it makes everything more flexible, more resilient and I see it is an enabling technology.\": Energy firm boosted by US investmentMr Williams said: \"We come in and our technology helps deal with the physics and economics in the short-term volatility of renewables.\"But it also provides a  for other technologies whether it be storage, batteries or fly-wheels, or whatever we end up using, all these things can work in collaboration with Faraday Grid to solve the bigger picture to really enable this energy future that we all want.\"The company aims to be at full commercial status within two years.\"It was one of the key designs considerations when we started working on this many years ago, is that we needed a system that was going to give us this future but it had to be achievable as well.\"We had to have a pathway that we could afford to actually do and one that was going to technically allow us to get to the right endpoint.\"So, thats why one of the major things was how do we do this transition  And thats why a Faraday Exchanger is designed to be a drop-in replacer where a transformer would traditionally be located because we know that theres already a capital replacement schedule in place for those out there.\": Energy firm boosted by US investmentHe said: \"You dont need to replace everything all at once and suddenly switch over to this new system.\"A Faraday Exchanger can literally be dropped into the existing network and it immediately adds value in its local area.\"It resolves the problems of noise in the system and voltage control and these things.\"But then as you start putting multiple exchangers within a grid, they start collaborating and coordinating to form a Faraday Grid and the value that Faraday Grid delivers as a system, rather than those inidual devices, is much better than any inidual device can give by itself.\"One of the key constraints is what we can afford to do. It needs to be achievable, so again its designed in such a way that with existing capital replacement budgets that utilities already have, you can roll out Faraday Grid.\"Instead of buying transformers all this other equipment, theyre able to just buy Faraday Exchangers instead.\"But because with Faraday Grid the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts, what we actually do with utilities is work very close with them and we simulate the entirety of their network,\"We look at their whole network, we can look at how powers generated and used at the moment, what they expect to happen in the future and not only can we then in the virtual world determine what that grid should look like in , ,  years time with them.\"We can actually also then start to look at the economics of it and say well,you stay within your existing capital budget, this would be when you would target putting in the first devices because theyre going to have the biggest benefit.\"Butyou wanted to expedite roll out to get things faster, it would deliver these additional benefits. You then wouldnt be so dependent on the balancing services that the National Grid is spending over a billion pounds a year on.\"A Faraday Grid is able to provide that balancing service from the grid itself, rather than having to procure it from external parties.\"So whilst were making the grid more flexible and having more renewables, were also reducing the cost of energy to the consumer.\"Were still pre-commercial with the technology at the moment.\"Weve manufactured devices, weve had external testing through our power networks demonstration centre in Glasgow.\"Were on the pathway to our next stage as a business is doing what I would call proof of concept projects with utilities.\"Weve targeted utilities as our first pathway into the market because the network effect of operating within the grid allows us to have a real multiplier effect and its where we can add the most value.\"So we will work with a number of utilities globally to do these projects over the next year or two and on the back of that we will be a full commercial business.\"Its tremendously exciting. Scotland has been a great place for us as a business. Theres great talent both in Scotland and Scotlands obviously being very open as a country has enabled us to attract talent from across Europe as well.\"Its at the forefront of all renewables and pushing the boundaries and quite innovative. So its been a fantastic place for a business like us. But then very similar to Australia.ldquoIts going to be quite collaborative because, as an engineer I would say physics is everywhere.\"Our technology is ubiquitous, we want to be able to deliver the value that we have to the world.\"Scotland and the UK is very important, but we also want to be able to add value in Europe and North America and Australia and Japan and these key markets. In order to do that we need to grow very quickly as a business.\"So we have established innovation centres, its set in Scotland and then in Washington DC and now in Czech Republic as well and thats just to enable us to have the right skills and resources to be able to deliver globally.\"We have plans to open additional centres as well. Weve grown over the last couple of years from just the founders to reach a couple of hundred people globally now.\"Were calculating by the end of the year having a thousand people, and then growing from there.\"From a business perspective the next steps are also the projects to demonstrate the technology in real world grids.\"We want to do this across dferent geographies in dferent types of regulatory markets with dferent technical use cases.\"One might be a really congested area, a major city, one might be where theres a lot of rooftop solar or a long radial line that has voltage control issues.\"We really want to demonstrate that the value that our technology can add over such a wide range of cases because ultimately we believe that access to reliable, affordable and clean energy is really one of the most critical issues facing society in a sense.\"We cant focus just on having clean and reliable without having affordable energy as well, and Faraday Grid as a  is about enabling all three of those at the same time.Setting in Edinburgh three years ago allowed the founders \"to take advantage of Scotlandrsquos world-class engineering heritage, have access to leading academic institutions and utilise the talent pool across the country\".However, the seed of the Faraday Grid idea started many years before this, and the founders say they have been working on solving the worldrsquos biggest challenges throughout their careers.The team says that in seeing issues with the Australian electricity grid ndash with claims of blackouts and regular energy price increases, which in some states were said to have doubled over the last  years ndash it became their vocation to ldquoresolve the worldrsquos fragile energy system.He added: \"Michael Faraday was one of the most influential scientists in history and his inventions and discoveries have laid the foundation for the work we are doing, designing an energy infrastructure fit for the future.ldquoAt Faraday Grid, with our mission to provide secure, sustainable and affordable energy for everyone, we stand on the shoulders of giants.QAWhat countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why I enjoy the culture, history and architecture in European cities.

AVA is a one-stop-shop for all things volunteering and its Development Officers work right across theand breadth of Aberdeenshire.Keith Anderson, AVA Head of Development said: “Helping volunteering to happen is a key part of our work and an area that we all enjoy. We are always amazed at people’s generosity with their time and that willingness to be there for others makes such a dference.”During this year’s Volunteer Week AVA celebrated Margaret Murison for over  years of volunteering in Balmedie.Margaret was honoured as an outstanding volunteer in May with a presentation by AVA at The Friendship Club within Eigie House in Balmedie, where Margaret volunteers.Well-wishers, friends and family all wanted to be in on the surprise presentation for Margaret – but once word sneaked out the lounge was soon filled to capacity as everyone descended on Eigie House to see Margaret receive her award.The event was organised by Rosie Nicol from Belhelvie Community Trust, who spoke about her dedication to some special projects in the district, including The Beach Wheelchairs and The Sand Bothy. Margaret used to work in the bank for many years so generally gets asked to deal with many of the financial elements of the organisations she helps.She is also an invaluable source of expertise on family history locally, enjoys her garden and volunteering with the Church which is very close to her heart.AVA Development Officer, Lorna Sandison said: “I am delighted to be included in on-going and new projects in the Balmedie area as it is such a motivated and connected community where lessons can be learned as to how communities should indeed interact.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"explorer scouts raise over 1k at fun dog show event","story":"The Daviot and Oldmeldrum Explorer Scouts kicked off fundraising for their second trip to volunteer at a school in Uganda at the weekend.The group held their annual Fun Dog Show in Oldmeldrum on Sunday, June .The event raised around £,.At the Fun Dog Show there was a choice of ten classes and over  dogs took part.The DOM Explorer Scouts ran a tea and cake tent whilst a number of local pet-related businesses had stalls.The Scratch Club from Inverurie ran Flyball demonstations and also let people try with their own dogs.The DOM Explorer Scouts were supported by a number of local businesses who sponsored the event.They hope to hold the next Fun Dog Show on Sunday, June  .In July  the DOM Explorer Scouts visited Ruhanga in SW Uganda to help finish building a School  Scout Hall that they had funded.

Back then, the joke was one of many in which male demands – for food, for clean laundry, for sex – were dismissed as a marker of female empowerment. “How can you make the male orgasm more intense  Who cares ” was another. Though they made a powerful point, these jokes might be considered beyond the pale today the first, in particular, does not endorse domestic abuse, but it does make light of it, and society is, quite rightly, less tolerant of the normalisation of violence than it used to be Delilah.Last week, Brand made another joke involving violence. Askedshe agreed Britain was living through a terrible parliamentary time, she told BBC Radio ’s Heresy programme: “Yes, I would say that because certain unpleasant characters are being thrown to the fore, and they’re very, very easy to hate, and I’m kind of thinking, why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid ”This wasn’t as clever as the breadkne joke nor was it judicious. It didn’t take long for Nigel Farage, milkshake survivor and early adopter of the “snowflake” jibe, to get on the case within a matter of hours, Brand was facing calls for her to be sacked by the BBC, and the police had launched an investigation .Judging from the many character references she has accrued over the past few days, Brand is a good and likeable human being who has mellowed since her days as a ball-breaker. Given her comments were made on a satirical show, they couldn’t really be construed as incitement to violence, and she later offered a whole-hearted apology – in contrast to the self-serving one recently proffered by Danny Baker.Judging by the character assassinations accrued by Farage over the past four years, he is a bad and dislikeable human being given he has previously stoked hatred towards immigrants and recently defended Ann Widdecombe over her apparent endorsement of gay conversion therapy, it is impossible to regard his response to Brand as anything other than hypocrisy.Nevertheless, at a time when the atmosphere in the UK is febrile when people are genuinelywhen one MP has been murdered and others have received death threats, all public figures – including comedians – ought to be extra vigilant about their use of language. Like Frankie Boyle’s “Where the F*** are the IRA when you need them ” quip about Theresa May’s famous Chequers meeting, Brand’s joke runs the risk of normalising revenge as a response to these most dficult of times.Accepting Brand made a misjudgment, however, does not prevent us asking why comedians are taking so much flak for mocking politicians when politicians are taking the piss out of the electorate without facing any repercussions at all. Why are Victorian villains like coke-snorting Michael Gove and Jacob Rees “I’m allergic to the concept of human rights” Mogg, given free rein to spread their repugnant views regardless of the offence they cause  Why is Boris Johnson – a man who once discussed a plan to have a tabloid journalist beaten up – still considered a viable candidate for prime minister  Brand’s flippancy is much less toxicthan their mendacity.A few days before Brand made her comments, two High Court judges ruled Johnson should not face charges over comments he made during the EU referendum campaign about the UK sending £m a week to Brussels. The UK does not send £m a week to Brussels. In most contexts his claim – emblazoned on the side of the Leave bus – would be considered a “lie”. But for the purposes of this piece let’s call it “spin”. While Brand’s light-hearted remarks attracted much ire, Boris’s “spin” – which fuelled the eventual Leave victory and so played a key role in creating this crisis – was judged not to constitute an abuse of power. Spin : Jokes, nil.Meanwhile, there is no suggestion that a referendum – held on a whim, without a plan, by a bunch of empty egotists – could be voided. Even though the campaign was illegally funded even though it was based on myths, the result is touted as the democratic will of the country. That’s a prank and a half, isn’t it  Makes Brand’s jape look a bit flaccid. Of course, the laughter’s ringing hollow now companies are deserting our shores, and we’re nowhere nearer securing our actual exit. But, again, there are to be no apparent consequences for those who wrecked our children’s futures for the bantz.The reason those on the right feel able to stoke the backlash against Brand even as they defend the likes of Count Dankulaon freedom of speech grounds, is that this is not really about the jokes or the offence they cause: it’s a proxy war on the left.That’s why the right-wing papers consistently refer to Brand as a “left-wing” comedian it’s why commentators such as Piers Morgan whine on about double standards. Why was Baker sacked from the BBC [for a tweet that was perceived to be racist] and Brand wasn’t  Well,  because Brand isn’t employed by the BBCand  because there is no equivalence between race, which is an innate characteristic, and being a hard Brexiteer which is a poor lestyle choice.You could just as easily ask why Baker was sacked for a “racist” tweet , while comments about burqa-wearing women looking like letter boxes and references to piccaninnies glide off the slippery Johnson. The answer would be wealth and power and social connections. The answer would be Eton and the Bullingdon Club and the old boys’ network.These are the evils that are breaking Britain not some off-colour joke on a satirical programme. So, yes, comedians: think before you speak. Try not to make the Brexit debate more poisonous than it already is. But also, the rest of us: let’s not fixate over offensive jests at the expense of whopping great lies. What the likes of Boyle and Brand do to right-wing politicians is far less damaging than what right-wing politicians are doing to the country. When we allow ourselves to be dragged into another debate about the limits of satire, we ert attention away from their epic misdemeanours we walk willingly into the trap they have laid \u2028for us.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch are scots really as gloomy as the rest of the uk","story":"Britain is ided, pessimistic, angry, polarised and torn apart by social class, geography and Brexit. For some reason, these findings of the grandly titled #Mood of the Nation# survey, are meant to come as a surprise. per cent of Britons feel pessimistic about national unity.  per cent say British politics is not fit for purpose. One in five people expects to be a victim of violent crime or to witness attacks on friends or family members.  per cent feel let down by the political establishment   per cent believe the country has become an international laughing stock. Leave voters and elderly people are almost twice as optimistic about the future as twenty-somethings and Remain voters. : Tory leadership debate: Rivals turn on Dominic Raab as Boris Johnson stays at homeBut these disparate groups also agree on a few things. A staggering  per cent think the UK needs a strong leader but only  per cent think the next Prime Minister will be up to the job. There is Britain’s problem in a baffling nutshell.The mismatch between longed-for political superhero and typical party leader clearly contributes massively to voter-dissatisfaction. If voters think a “strong” Putin Trump or Farage style leaderis the solution to Britain’s problems, it’s no wonder they feel anxious and despairing, since no-one angling for the Toryleadership is single-handedly up to that mammoth task. : Boris Johnson could face vote of no confidencehe becomes PM says SNP leaderHowever, those contradictory responses lead me to conclude that very few Scots were included in this measure of “the national mood.” Scots have shortcomings, but the naïve belief that a single human being can “fix” the nation ain’t generally one of them. Our political debate revolves around the location and control of powers, institutions, democratic rules, taxes and weapon systems – inidualsless so.As usual, Scots examining this “major new survey” don’t knowthe findings include them orLondon-based data has been extrapolated to cover the whole of Britain. And the pollsters don’t feel obliged to even explain.This matters. If only a meaningless handful of Scots was involved in the survey commissioned by strategy consultants, Britain Thinks , it’ll be mildly annoying for us, but also a missed opportunity for the vexed southern electorate to get much-needed perspective on the real nature of “Britain-wide” gloom -- what generates it, what minimises it and therefore what might help English voters escape it.A massive poll conducted last year by the BBC, came up with the same overall pessimistic verdict, but drilled down further to discover that English folk were most gloomy, despite demographic dominance of every British institution from the BBC to the Commons while independence and Remain-voting Scots – thwarted in both referendums – were actually the cheeriest folk in Britain.Union supporters might argue that this is simply because Scots have the best of both worlds. There’s a more likely explanation. Scotland’s Yes voters remain upbeat, no matter the setbacks, because most are already mentally and emotionally detached from the failing institutions of the UK, have a clear, un-romanticised view of Britain’s imperial past and a shared vision, motivation or goal – call it what you will, but it keeps folk feeling hopeful, and that optimism might even have rubbed off on No voters and Conservatives who were found to be statistically more pessimistic. Love them or hate them, the Scottish Government believes better days lie ahead, and the BBC poll demonstrated that such conviction really matters in setting a benchmark for voter optimism.More Scots surveyed believed that the country’s best days were in the futurethan in the past . This was a marked contrast to England, where % said the country was better in the past while only % felt the best days were yet to come. According to the BBC’s own website “Polling experts said data showing greater optimism about the future in Scotland and Wales was largely down to responses from independence supporters in these areas.”Contrast the plight of folk in England with a  vision of past glory, a set of hard-to-eject Tory politicians on an endless, dignity-reducing mission to cut public services without a leboat, parachute or escape route in sight. No wonder gloom abounds. The BBC survey also found that  per cent of Scots surveyed thought Scotland was better than most other countries in the world. Just  per cent thought it was worse. That could mean we have an o’er guid conceit of ourselves – “wha’s like us” -- but it could also mean Scots know we are blessed compared to the majority of poorer nations across the world and our gubbed, hopeless southern neighbours who still hope a strong leader can save them. Just for the record, the BBC’s  survey, spoke to more than , people in Scotland, a similar number in Wales and more than , in England. The Britain Thinks’ sample total was just two thousand people.Does it mattercommentators and London based politicians think the whole UK is covered in a unorm blanket of despair  Will the Britain Thinks diagnosis of mass hopelessness be dismissed as a national nervous breakdown, or sourced to the pervasive elitism of British politics, the absence of grassroots democracy and the festering presence of nihilism and consumerism  Last week a Scottish commentator objected to Nicola Sturgeon’s talk of Scottish values. Values are indeed slippery things to define, but a le without them, without their clear, unapologetic shaping influence in politics produces precisely the kind of despair felt south of the border today.That’s why Rory Stewart has become a breath of fresh air amidst the stale, dishonesty of the Tory leadership campaign. I wouldn’t vote for a man who describes himself as the economic conservative who’ll get Brexit finished first. But he’s right to talk about trust. Essentially Rory Stewart is riding high amongst actual votersbecause he sounds like he wouldn’t sell his granny. If Scots do emerge as cheerier than English voters in this latest research, our optimism will have little to do with geography and everything to do with political culture, parliament, institutions and civic le, all of which explicitly reject Britain’s failed experiment with market supremacy. Sooner or later that totally un-surveyed penny will drop.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland figures branded deplorable after 21 shows have no viewers at all","story":" shows recorded no audience some days, according to the Mail on Sunday.The viewing figures prompted media watchers to brand the channel a waste of taxpayer money.But a BBC spokesperson said: \"Its not unusual for digital channels outwith the main five to occasionally record zero audiences.\"According to the Sunday newspaper report, on one particularly quiet day last month the new channel had an average audience of only , people.The figures were gathered from The British Audiences Research Boardbetween February  and June  this year.

Chairman Simon Walton said: “Positive news of electrication, no matter how early in the process, is very encouraging for the railway, and for our ambition to see the line extended through Hawick to Carlisle.“It’s better for the railway, particularly given the challenging topography. Electrication would offer better reliability and capacity, with newer and faster trains.“However, we must continue to campaign vigorously for further infrastructure enhancements – such as more double track sections and a better junction with the east coast main line at Portobello in the east of Edinburgh.”David Spaven, author of Waverley Route, said: “Electrication – with faster acceleration of trains – would help to overcome the signicant constraints imposed when the Scottish Government decided to build the line with much less double track than previously planned.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !!

Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.What does horses have to do with speedsterIm not defending speeding. Im saying this is the safest bit of road we have for overtaking and saying that youcannot possibly know the speed of the other cars without measuring equipment.Engine power is expressed in horsepower and lots of horsepower enables some to be faster than others going up hills than others.Haydn I have driven small cars which feel like they need a push going up our hills, that is all.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case .."},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely.

As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

We were to stay in the Adelaide Suite on the th floor, which was the seamless marriage of stylish meets comfort. Our view was to the east of the city with the top of Scrabo Tower in the distance. A Nespresso coffee maker, tea, complimentary biccies and robes and slippers were waiting along with the latest magazines to delve into. If after the ultimate in sheer indulgence, guests can opt for the chance to slip into a ‘bespoke soak’ and have your tub ran for you by one of the hotel’s bath butlers which incorporates a bath filled with essential ESPA oils, self-heating eye masks and the all-important treats. They say that eating and sleeping are two of le’s greatest pleasures and at the Grand Central the hotel excels.Because it was a special occasion we were booked into the hotel’s exquisite Seahorse restaurant and as a storm whipped up on Bedford Street – yes this is June – we were greeted by manager Rachel Brown, a fantastic asset to the hotel and promptly welcomed with a slate of moreish, freshly baked Guinness and treacle bread. The bread was devoured before a delicate Amuse Bouche of raw roasted caullower in butter, caullower purée, blitzed beetroot and crispy kale seared in butter followed.Appetisers on the menu, devised by Executive Chef Damian Tumilty, included ham hock and foie gras terrine, local crab dressed in a yogurt and mirin sauce but it was the ‘stars’ of the sea, local scallops served with a Jersusalem artichoke velouté and black olives, times two, that won out. Mains of roast monkfish tail with herb crusted potatoes, beetroot and asparagus along with crispy pork belly with a sizable wedge of potato gratin, caullower and cider soaked raisins were ordered and were hands down two of the most memorable meals we have ever had the pleasure of eating. The chunky monkish tail was cooked perfectly with the beetroot and asparagus proving the right light companions to the dish. An empty plate across the table seconded my opinion that this was a stand out dining experience. Having next to no room I waved the white flag, napkin and declined dessert. My husband opted for a slated caramel, popcorn covered chocolate slice that complimented all that came before.Much has already been written about the Grand Central’s Observatory Bar, sat atop its rd floor being a must see – and every word of it is true. The bar is accessed via its own lt and operator and once brought in the views are nothing short of spectacular, encompassing the city and all its quarters. Over a pint and G#T we watched the sun disappear over a grey blanket of rain clouds and revert back again, such is having our own weather system.After the best night sleep in ages thanks to the hotel’s King Coil beds, we were back in the Seahorse for breakfast. All self service, there was no chance of going hungry as huge bowls of fresh fruit, coulis, muesli, granola and yogurt along with Irwin’s bread selection were all at your disposal. A hot breakfast is also on offer and my request of poached eggs was no trouble at the kitchen pass. Pots of freshly brewed coffee and tea set us up for the day and sadly it was time for check out.It was not an inconvenience for us or guests upon leaving to leave our bags at reception to collect at a later stage in the day, a great service when you still want to have a look round the shops and not have to ‘lug’ your luggage with you.The Grand Central celebrates its first birthday this month but already feels like it was always part of the Bedford Streetscape as it has set about making its mark. Tourists and those wanting something memorable to celebrate, can do so, in classic style, at the Grand Central.For more information visit www.grandcentralhotelbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reps and union leaders meet over upskirting","story":"NORTH Belfast political representatives have joined union officials in meeting two teachers who were the victims of ‘upskirting’ to discuss the need for legislation around the issue.The meeting, which took place at Stormont on Monday, comes after the conviction of, Timothy Boomer , who was recently convicted of five counts of outraging public decency in relation to videos he took as a pupil at a Co Fermanagh school in  and .In itself, the act of ‘upskirting’ is not a crime in the North of Ireland, and campaigners have long called for legislation on the issue, which was discussed at Monday’s meeting.Speaking to the North Belfast News, NASUWT official, Justin McCamphill, said:“We held the meeting to give the victims in that case to set out their experiences and to discuss why the current legislation is inadequate.“The women actually had to take a judicial review against the PPS before the case was prosecuted. It was prosecuted under counts of outraging public decency.“The problem with that law is that it doesn’t treat them as the victims – it treats the general public as the victims. The conviction only happened because it was proven to be a public place because there was more than two people present. If there were no other people there it wouldn’t be illegal at all.“We were there to argue for specic laws. There are similar laws in Scotland, England and Wales, but we want our own bespoke laws.”He added: “In the event that the assembly is up and running we will be going to the justice committee and asking them to make a recommendation to the Department of Justice to bring in legislation to address this.”Following the meeting, North Belfast People Before Profit Councillor, Fiona Ferguson stressed the importance of better legislation and culture change to deal with this kind of sexual crime.“These women were let down by their employer, the police and the legal system. At points they were essentially told ‘boys will be boys’ and even when a prosecution was made, it was under common law of ‘outraging public decency’, which means that in the eyes of the law, the public witnesses were the victims, not the teachers who were upskirted. “We need comprehensive legislation that deals with cases where images are taken deliberately and without consent, so that victims can have a reasonable expectation of justice. And we need a societal sht in how we view consent. It is not good enough that in  women feel unsafe in their workplaces. It is not good enough that cases of upskirting are being dealt with in ways that reinforce the ‘boys will be boys’ culture that justies sexual crime.“The DoJ proposes to adopt the voyeurism legislation in Britain but it would not have led to a prosecution in the case of these teachers, and that is shows that it is not comprehensive enough.’“These women are incredibly brave for speaking out for other women and girls, and NASUWT should be commended for supporting them and leading th"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38224287.ece/3f8e8/BINARY/bt_2105KS19_664.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts emergency services at scene of car overturned on belfasts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

According to the guide, republican artwork featured \"themes of freedom from oppression, and a rising nationalist confidence that romantically and surreally mix and match images from the Book Of Kells\". \"The Celtic mist mock-heroic posters of the Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick, assorted phoenixes rising from the ashes and revolutionaries clad in splendidly idiosyncratic sombreros and bandanas from ideological battlegrounds in Mexico and South America,\" it added. Professor Peter Shirlow, head of Irish Studies at Liverpool University, expressed shock at the content, \"which plays on many sectarian myths\" and \"represented the Protestant community as humourless\". \"It represented them as Bible-bashers, against liberalism and it evoked an idea that on the other side there was humour, a capacity for art and also evoked the idea republican violence was something to be gloried and where it represented the unionist community, it is not,\" he added. \"If it was the Catholic, nationalist, republican communityI would say the same thing.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"derry woman appointed managing director global strategy consultancy firm","story":"A Derry woman has been appointed to the role of Managing Director at a leading firm specialising in leadership strategy.Tessa Breslinassumed the role in recent weeks and will now head up YSC’s Americas Division spanning the United States, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.YSC Consulting uses their expertise in behavioural science to help organisations across the globe connect the dots between business strategy and leadership.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

It is important we all work to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan bioblitz to locate identity of wildlife in forest park  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Park is the venue for a special race against the clock this weekend.Scientists, naturalists and members of the public will be taking part in a lsquobioblitzrsquo to find identy as many species as a possible over a period of  hours.The countdown begins on Friday at pm with a bat talk and nocturnal walk with the Northern Ireland Bat Group.On Saturday morning local moth expert Andy Crory will set out to discover what moths have been caught overnight.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/9834158.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business

The Supreme Inter-Breed Championship was awarded to Ballymoney Suffolk breeder Jason Watson with a hogget ewe..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog “She is home bred and is just over one year old now,” Jason explained.“She did very well for us at Balmoral and will go to the ram for this first tome this autumn.”Sammy Clyde with the Inter-Breed Beef Champion at Ballymena Show  - Clydevalley OsakaMeanwhile in the cattle rings, the Supreme Championship of the Show came down to a ‘shoot out’ between the inter-breed beef and dairy champions.Ballymena is renowned for its commitment to hosting an overarching award, which reflects the best dairy and beef genetics entered for the show. This year’s dairy champion was the Holstein third calver, Robinwood Atwood Vicky. The cow is owned by the Henry family from Ballymoney. She calved in February of this year and is currently giving L of milk per day. The inter-breed dairy judge, John Gilmore from Ayrshire, described his champion as an excellent example of the Holstein breed.In the final class of the day Victory was up against the beef inter breed champion – the choice Limousin heer, Clydevalley Osaka. She is owned by the Clyde family, from Templepatrick. Beef inter-breed judge, Gareth Behan from Port Laoise described the -month old heer as a breeding animal with tremendous potential.But it was to be the Holstein cow’s day. Both inter-breed judges agreed that Vicky just had the edge on the younger Limousin heer. But, be in no doubt, Osaka will have plenty of future opportunities to confirm all her undoubted potential.

We try to reduce the number of times in the year we might have to deal with jetlag.”Keith said it still makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end when hearing people sing one of the Getty’s hymns: “It’s very special for us. I’ve been at funeral services and heard them sung, I’ve been at bedsides where I’ve heard them sung.“It’s inspiring in dferent ways – that’s why we write hymns, for people to sing, whether it’s a melody that thousands of people can sing in an arena or for  people to sing in the wee Presbyterian Church around the corner.”Looking ahead to tonight’s SSE Arena show Kristyn said: “I’ve got butterflies in my tummy. It’s excitement more than nerves.“Three of our four girls will be there. The baby will be in bed.”Keith said: “There is something special about [tonight].

Nashville loves the Irish and Irish people love Nashville. “They share a common love of music – country music and bluegrass and Americana which are the sounds of Nashville all find their origin in Irish music. There’s also a theological and Christian heritage in common.”Talking about their faith, Kristyn said: “In Nashville we go to a church called the Village Chapel.

The great thing about singing hymns is we can enjoy so many dferent denominations.”Askedit was possible write a better hymn than Thine Be The Glory, Keith said: “I don’t know how you top that. The melody was written by Handel from an oratorio named Judas Maccabaeus.“I don’t ever consider myself in Handel’s league, but I suppose I can identy with finding it hard to top something. “Our first songbecame so popular that we’ve never been able to top it.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The young kits born in the school enclosures will then be released by NIEA into specially selected sites across Northern Ireland to bolster existing colonies.At the allotmentThe passion of Mr Coleman has inspired the children to such an extent that they have received letters of support and enthusiasm from Sir David Attenborough.The allotments, half of which are for the pupils to grow produce, are also rented by members of the community at a small surcharge and with the proviso that they come and help clean up around the school.Video: Timeline and CCTV of suspected IRA unit on way to attempt to

I prefer to get my sessions out of the way at the start of the day as I just couldn’t face the gym in the evening..amI normally start my day at our offices in Holywood with a quick meeting with our head of finance and head of production. Communication is crucial in television as schedules, filming and edits change constantly.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction.

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
