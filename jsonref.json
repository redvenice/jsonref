[{"url":null,"title":"Meet couples dared let BBC covers","story":"Share this article She\u0027d felt \u0027tense\u0027 she says. Thankfully she doesn\u0027t give many details, but you get the impression the earth didn\u0027t move for the 30-year-old. It didn\u0027t even rumble.In a separate video clip, Nick, 34, looks as shame-faced as a naughty schoolboy being ticked off for failing a spelling test. He\u0027s definitely in the dog house, he says. His wife is furious, claiming he didn\u0027t do his homework on how to mix essential oils.It\u0027s rare we see what really goes on in other people\u0027s relationships. But this intimate glimpse — part of the controversial new BBC1 fly-on-the-wall series Sex On The Couch — allows us, for the first time, a rare and tantalising peek behind the bedroom doors of real married couples with some very real problems they\u0027re all too willing to share.In each of the six 45-minute episodes, two couples are filmed attending three sessions with a sex therapist in a Manchester clinic called The Annexe.Although the swish interior-designed therapy rooms were specially created for the series, the problems the couples face are real — along with the counselling sessions they get from the show\u0027s therapists.All of the couples picked are in their 20s and early 30s, showing sex problems are just as much an issue for Millennial couples as middle-aged ones.It seems that while this generation has been exposed to more sex online and in the media than ever before, they are struggling to deal with intimacy.What\u0027s more, it also shows how, in this world of constant self-analysis and information overload, even the bedroom is no longer a sanctuary between man and wife. All of the couples were delighted to share the most intimate details of their relationship in a bid to get their love lives back on track.At the end of each session, couples get \u0027homework\u0027 exercises to do during the week to improve things. After Louisa and Nick\u0027s romantic night ends in failure, they come back for their second session with therapist Lohani Noor to analyse what went wrong.         They said the passion had stopped burning after five years together - but the programme\u0027s therapists reveal the trust died when Nick didn\u0027t tell Louisa he\u0027d been made redundant As the couple, from Amersham, Bucks, sit on opposite ends of a velvet sofa, it\u0027s clear there\u0027s more than just physical distance between them.The passion which, in Nick\u0027s words, \u0027just burned brighter and brighter\u0027 after they first met as colleagues at a magazine publisher five years ago, and married two years ago, has ebbed away so much that they now describe their sex lives as virtually non-existent.The cameras in the therapy room are clearly well-hidden because it all comes tumbling out about how Louisa is often too tired for sex because she suffers with ME and chronic pain.Meanwhile, Nick freely offers that he\u0027s \u0027selfish\u0027 because he has no patience for foreplay and wants to get down to business as soon as he feels \u0027frisky\u0027 — so it\u0027s clear why Louisa is now complaining about \u0027a disconnect\u0027.         Therapist Lohani tells Louisa to pause when she hears herself use her mothering voice — and rather than leave her to handle everything, Nick needs to grow up and take more responsibilityThe couple, who volunteered to have therapy on TV after Louisa saw an appeal on a Relate social media page, are now looking for ways to compromise.But the message of the programme reveals what most of us suspect: that sex problems are caused by tensions in a couple\u0027s relationship, not by what happens between the sheets.It soon transpires that it\u0027s not libido that\u0027s separating Louisa and Nick, but a lack of trust.Sensing there\u0027s more at stake, with issues running deeper than not having the right essential oils to hand, therapist Lohani teases out that Louisa lost her trust in Nick when he didn\u0027t tell her he had lost his job as a sports journalist for three months for fear of disappointing her.By careful probing, it transpires Nick is perpetually cast as a naughty child who can\u0027t be trusted to do anything right, with Louisa falling into the role of scolding motherteacher.This is playing out in their sex lives. From Louisa\u0027s rebuking tone, which is met by Nick hanging his head in shame, Lohani surmises that they have adopted roles that don\u0027t make for fireworks in the bedroom. \u0027When you are you talking to each other in this way, there\u0027s never going to be any sex,\u0027 she says.From now on, Lohani say Louisa needs to pause when she hears herself use her mothering voice — and rather than leave her to handle everything, Nick needs to grow up and take more responsibility. Listening to what happens between other couples behind closed doors is fascinating, and it\u0027s dynamics like these that will doubtless enlighten viewers to what is happening in their own relationships.But as the couples make so many embarrassing confessions along the way — Nick, for example, squirms as he reveals how some of his \u0027techniques\u0027 could be better — you can\u0027t help but wonder what drove these couples to allow cameras to film this most private part of their lives.There is, of course, the fact it\u0027s free — a 50-minute session with one of the counsellors would cost as much as £120.But while Nick admits he\u0027d rather his parents didn\u0027t see the programme and his mates are likely to tease him, he says he hopes others will appreciate they were brave enough to do all they could to repair their relationship.                Chloe Halvin, 27, with partner Tony Atkinson, 28, pictured at their home in Blackpool, LancsNext up are Tony Atkinson, a 28-year-old graphic designer and his fiancee Chloe Havlin, a 27-year-old hotel receptionist, from Blackpool.They have sex at least once a week, with Tony sometimes texting his partner of three years \u0027to book himself in\u0027.But due to the fact they\u0027ve got a two-year-old daughter, plus girls aged five and eight from Chloe\u0027s previous relationship, most encounters are \u0027quickies\u0027 which leave both unsatisfied. \u0027Foreplay is like a treat for us...it\u0027s like once a month.\u0027Homework from therapist Kate Moyle, who diagnoses they need to prioritise more time for themselves, is a rule that there must be at least five minutes of kissing before intercourse.They must also set aside a bowl for written ideas about what they\u0027d like to do to each other. Back at home, Chloe films herself using a fluffy pen to scribble down as many ideas as she can to put in a Pyrex dish she keeps on the kitchen counter — including role-play games, blindfolds and different positions.         After having better sex the couple don\u0027t bicker as much, the experts discoverWhen the couple come back to the clinic, grinning from ear to ear, it\u0027s clear that making time for each other with some early nights and some fresh inspiration has had benefits for the rest of their relationship, too. They gleefully report to having \u0027proper\u0027 sex up to three times a week and it turns out the rosy glow is no longer confined to the bedroom.Chloe announces they are more in love than ever while Tony observes they have stopped bickering and he doesn\u0027t get as uptight as he used to about when the washing-up isn\u0027t done.Next on the couch is hairdresser Dana Pearsall, 21, and 26-year-old partner James Williams, an automotive engineer, who live together in Walsall. A disparity in their sex drives, after two years together, has left them both miserable. He complains she is always pestering him for sex, while she calls him a \u0027once a week\u0027 boy.But according to therapist Roberta Babb, different sex drives aren\u0027t the problem — it\u0027s how couples communicate their different needs. She said: \u0027It\u0027s about taking away that responsibility and that feeling of pressure and just thinking: \u0027Let\u0027s have some fun.\u0027 To that end, Dana and James are sent off with a sex ban for a week to build the tension and a questionnaire to help them talk about each other\u0027s fantasies, as they\u0027ve never really discussed what they would like to do to each other.Here, too, there is another underlying reason for the rising tensions. This time, it is down to the fact that James\u0027s previous girlfriend cheated on him nine months before he met Dana, making him insecure and fearful she would do the same.However by giving them some exercises, the spark is back. Dana says: \u0027We didn\u0027t realise what we\u0027d lost. I want to keep hugging him and telling him I love him.\u0027There\u0027s another happy outcome which is, thanks to the sex the couple had during the filming, they are now expecting their first child in August.         Dana Pearsall, 21, and James Williams, 26, who live together in Walsall, are sent away with a sex ban to build the tension back up in their relationship         The pair seem much closer after being given \u0027homework\u0027 to share their fantasies with each other, having never thought to do so beforeIndeed, since finishing the programme last year, all three couples claim the sessions have improved their relationships for the better.However, therapy can also be the deciding factor that ends a relationship. Joanne, 20, and Craig, 28, from Newcastle, have only been together for 18 months but have already married and had a baby.They no longer have sex — partly because Joanne admits she even has trouble saying the word, referring to it obliquely as \u0027Smex\u0027.Therapy is clearly hard for her as she says she was raised to believe that \u0027what goes on in the bedroom, stays in the bedroom\u0027.However, it seems love-making is the least of their difficulties. Raising their son has built up a catalogue of resentment. Slowly we see the couple\u0027s relationship unravel.They agree when their therapist Silva Neves tells them: \u0027What I\u0027m hearing is that you want to regain what you had. In your history, you have not had a long time in sexual discovery. You\u0027ve moved very quickly. You became parents before you finished being lovers.\u0027But when the couple try to do the homework to bring them closer — to have a minute-long full body hug twice a day for a week — they only do it twice and row the rest of time.         Veteran psychotherapist Phillip Hodson believes the programmes could show first-hand how well therapy can help couples listen to each other\u0027s points of view, often for the first timeThe death knell comes when, back in therapy, they answer a questionnaire about why they are staying in the relationship — and find that both rate the fear of being alone higher than enjoying being with each other. When Craig reaches out to comfort her, Joanne pushes him away.The couple take the final two sessions separately — and the closing credits reveal they have since decided to separate.Veteran psychotherapist Phillip Hodson, who helped pioneer relationship and sex counselling in the UK, said it would be better to call the programme \u0027Couples On The Couch\u0027 rather than \u0027Sex On The Couch\u0027 because sex issues are nearly always inseparable from relationship difficulties.He believes the programmes could show first-hand how well therapy can help couples listen to each other\u0027s points of view, often for the first time.Difficult conversations, he says, do not always need to descend into rows. \u0027There is a tension between good TV and good therapy, however. Good TV would often mean the therapy has been difficult or disastrous. People love to see things go wrong.\u0027However, if handled well, this series could provide a useful way for viewers to think more realistically about their own relationships. It could give them more choices of how to react in their own conflicts and provide insight.\u0027It will also give people an understanding that they are almost never the only one with this sort of problem: in fact it\u0027s perfectly normal to feel as upset they do.\u0027Indeed, the programme makes it plain that good sex starts long before you get to the bedroom.As Lohani sends Nick and Louisa off to put what they\u0027ve learned into practice, Louisa observes: \u0027It\u0027s amazing how just focusing on sex has got our whole relationship back on track.\u0027If you can\u0027t trust someone in a relationship, you certainly can\u0027t trust them when you\u0027re vulnerable and naked.\u0027Sex On The Couch is on BBC1 at 11.25pm tonight."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/22/22/12586152-0-image-m-12_1555967503728.jpg","title":"Vauxhall recalls thousands Zafira people carriers","story":"Share this article Vauxhall, who were investigating 161 Zafira B fires, called back 234,000 models in two separate recalls due to rising safety concerns. The company wrote to 234,000 owners in December 2015 to ask them to arrange for their car\u0027s heating and ventilation system to be inspected by a local dealer.The initial recall came following reports of nearly 200 of the model bursting into flames.          The British carmaker has been forced into a third recall of the Zafira B range (stock photo) after at least one vehicle reportedly exploded due to overheatingSubsequently all Zafira B owners were offered a free safety inspection in light of the fires. A report by the Commons Transport Select Committee in April 2017 accused Vauxhall of showing a \u0027reckless disregard for safety\u0027 by not stopping motorists driving Zafira B vehicles it knew were a fire risk.The manufacturer was too slow to begin a full investigation, according to the cross-party committee. Vauxhall was also accused of acting prematurely in attributing the problem to improper repairs by third parties, according to the cross-party committee. Concerns that there was a distinctive pattern of fires were first raised within Vauxhall in 2014, but it did not begin an investigation until August 2015. Vauxhall recalls 235,000 Zafira B models for a THIRD time over blaze fears"},{"url":null,"title":"Drakes turns LA home Playboy style mansion","story":"Share this article Drake christened his property the YOLO (You Only Live Once) estate - after his hit song - and even had a sign outside that he got rid of after it was stolen several times.And just in case it wasn\u0027t clear that this is the ultimate bachelor pad, the star admitted that when he brings women home, he \u0027delights in flipping a switch beside a bookshelf, which swings open to reveal his bedroom\u0027.But the house isn\u0027t just for Drake to show the world that he\u0027s the second coming of Hugh Hefner. He\u0027s also turned it into a place that his family and friends can come to visit.Drake bought the two neighboring properties in 2016 and 2018 respectively for guests to stay in.

Listening to what happens between other couples behind closed doors is fascinating, and it\u0027s dynamics like these that will doubtless enlighten viewers to what is happening in their own relationships.But as the couples make so many embarrassing confessions along the way — Nick, for example, squirms as he reveals how some of his \u0027techniques\u0027 could be better — you can\u0027t help but wonder what drove these couples to allow cameras to film this most private part of their lives.There is, of course, the fact it\u0027s free — a 50-minute session with one of the counsellors would cost as much as £120.But while Nick admits he\u0027d rather his parents didn\u0027t see the programme and his mates are likely to tease him, he says he hopes others will appreciate they were brave enough to do all they could to repair their relationship.                Chloe Halvin, 27, with partner Tony Atkinson, 28, pictured at their home in Blackpool, LancsNext up are Tony Atkinson, a 28-year-old graphic designer and his fiancee Chloe Havlin, a 27-year-old hotel receptionist, from Blackpool.They have sex at least once a week, with Tony sometimes texting his partner of three years \u0027to book himself in\u0027.But due to the fact they\u0027ve got a two-year-old daughter, plus girls aged five and eight from Chloe\u0027s previous relationship, most encounters are \u0027quickies\u0027 which leave both unsatisfied. \u0027Foreplay is like a treat for us...it\u0027s like once a month.\u0027Homework from therapist Kate Moyle, who diagnoses they need to prioritise more time for themselves, is a rule that there must be at least five minutes of kissing before intercourse.They must also set aside a bowl for written ideas about what they\u0027d like to do to each other. Back at home, Chloe films herself using a fluffy pen to scribble down as many ideas as she can to put in a Pyrex dish she keeps on the kitchen counter — including role-play games, blindfolds and different positions.         After having better sex the couple don\u0027t bicker as much, the experts discoverWhen the couple come back to the clinic, grinning from ear to ear, it\u0027s clear that making time for each other with some early nights and some fresh inspiration has had benefits for the rest of their relationship, too. They gleefully report to having \u0027proper\u0027 sex up to three times a week and it turns out the rosy glow is no longer confined to the bedroom.Chloe announces they are more in love than ever while Tony observes they have stopped bickering and he doesn\u0027t get as uptight as he used to about when the washing-up isn\u0027t done.Next on the couch is hairdresser Dana Pearsall, 21, and 26-year-old partner James Williams, an automotive engineer, who live together in Walsall. A disparity in their sex drives, after two years together, has left them both miserable. He complains she is always pestering him for sex, while she calls him a \u0027once a week\u0027 boy.But according to therapist Roberta Babb, different sex drives aren\u0027t the problem — it\u0027s how couples communicate their different needs. She said: \u0027It\u0027s about taking away that responsibility and that feeling of pressure and just thinking: \u0027Let\u0027s have some fun.\u0027 To that end, Dana and James are sent off with a sex ban for a week to build the tension and a questionnaire to help them talk about each other\u0027s fantasies, as they\u0027ve never really discussed what they would like to do to each other.Here, too, there is another underlying reason for the rising tensions. This time, it is down to the fact that James\u0027s previous girlfriend cheated on him nine months before he met Dana, making him insecure and fearful she would do the same.However by giving them some exercises, the spark is back. Dana says: \u0027We didn\u0027t realise what we\u0027d lost. I want to keep hugging him and telling him I love him.\u0027There\u0027s another happy outcome which is, thanks to the sex the couple had during the filming, they are now expecting their first child in August.         Dana Pearsall, 21, and James Williams, 26, who live together in Walsall, are sent away with a sex ban to build the tension back up in their relationship         The pair seem much closer after being given \u0027homework\u0027 to share their fantasies with each other, having never thought to do so beforeIndeed, since finishing the programme last year, all three couples claim the sessions have improved their relationships for the better.However, therapy can also be the deciding factor that ends a relationship. Joanne, 20, and Craig, 28, from Newcastle, have only been together for 18 months but have already married and had a baby.They no longer have sex — partly because Joanne admits she even has trouble saying the word, referring to it obliquely as \u0027Smex\u0027.Therapy is clearly hard for her as she says she was raised to believe that \u0027what goes on in the bedroom, stays in the bedroom\u0027.However, it seems love-making is the least of their difficulties. Raising their son has built up a catalogue of resentment. Slowly we see the couple\u0027s relationship unravel.They agree when their therapist Silva Neves tells them: \u0027What I\u0027m hearing is that you want to regain what you had. In your history, you have not had a long time in sexual discovery. You\u0027ve moved very quickly. You became parents before you finished being lovers.\u0027But when the couple try to do the homework to bring them closer — to have a minute-long full body hug twice a day for a week — they only do it twice and row the rest of time.         Veteran psychotherapist Phillip Hodson believes the programmes could show first-hand how well therapy can help couples listen to each other\u0027s points of view, often for the first timeThe death knell comes when, back in therapy, they answer a questionnaire about why they are staying in the relationship — and find that both rate the fear of being alone higher than enjoying being with each other. When Craig reaches out to comfort her, Joanne pushes him away.The couple take the final two sessions separately — and the closing credits reveal they have since decided to separate.Veteran psychotherapist Phillip Hodson, who helped pioneer relationship and sex counselling in the UK, said it would be better to call the programme \u0027Couples On The Couch\u0027 rather than \u0027Sex On The Couch\u0027 because sex issues are nearly always inseparable from relationship difficulties.He believes the programmes could show first-hand how well therapy can help couples listen to each other\u0027s points of view, often for the first time.Difficult conversations, he says, do not always need to descend into rows. \u0027There is a tension between good TV and good therapy, however. Good TV would often mean the therapy has been difficult or disastrous. People love to see things go wrong.\u0027However, if handled well, this series could provide a useful way for viewers to think more realistically about their own relationships. It could give them more choices of how to react in their own conflicts and provide insight.\u0027It will also give people an understanding that they are almost never the only one with this sort of problem: in fact it\u0027s perfectly normal to feel as upset they do.\u0027Indeed, the programme makes it plain that good sex starts long before you get to the bedroom.As Lohani sends Nick and Louisa off to put what they\u0027ve learned into practice, Louisa observes: \u0027It\u0027s amazing how just focusing on sex has got our whole relationship back on track.\u0027If you can\u0027t trust someone in a relationship, you certainly can\u0027t trust them when you\u0027re vulnerable and naked.\u0027Sex On The Couch is on BBC1 at 11.25pm tonight."},{"url":null,"title":"Sainsburys Asda merger block applauded says ALEX BRUMMER","story":"Share this article Paradoxically, Asda – owned by the world\u0027s largest retailer, Walmart – has managed seven successive quarters of increased sales and market share in the UK, defying predictions that established supermarkets will struggle against the rise of German discounters and online challengers.City experts believe Sainsbury\u0027s recently appointed chairman, Martin Scicluna, will have little choice but to replace Coupe, considering that the failed merger attempt has cost the company tens of millions of pounds in legal and advisory fees and has left staff fearing for their future. Predictably, Sainsbury\u0027s has condemned the CMA for concluding that prices would have risen if the merger had gone ahead. It claimed that the innate competitiveness of the grocery market guaranteed to keep prices at a minimum.         The watchdog claimed that the deal would result in a \u0027substantial lessening of competition\u0027Its managers have privately expressed doubt about the quality of the analysis and the independence of the thinking of the CMA panel that reviewed the case.Ultimately, the collapse of the deal has far-reaching implications for British business and consumers. In recent decades, competition authorities have tried to avoid interfering in the free market. Several deals, such as Tesco\u0027s takeover of the wholesaler Booker and BT\u0027s absorption of mobile rival EE, have been nodded through with little interference.However, the arrival of Tyrie, a veteran of the Commons Treasury select committee, where he was the scourge of the big banks, has meant a more forensic approach.In effect, this means that any future merger plans between the country\u0027s biggest supermarkets are very unlikely to happen.Also, the CMA has sent a powerful signal to companies that directly serve customers – a warning that they will face high hurdles if they want to proceed with deals benefitting shareholders at the expense of consumers and suppliers.As such, the ruling against the Sainsbury\u0027s deal is a landmark one representing a significant rebalancing for free-market capitalism. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tesco issue recall Durex condoms","story":"Share this article \u0027Only for the batches of condoms affected by this issue, there could be an increase in the number of condoms that burst during application or use.\u0027The company has advised customers to seek advice from a doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours if a condom splits. However the company said there were no immediate safety concerns.          A diagram showing where customers should check the batch number of their products "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/22/22/12586152-0-image-m-12_1555967503728.jpg","title":"Vauxhall recalls thousands Zafira people carriers","story":"Share this article Vauxhall, who were investigating 161 Zafira B fires, called back 234,000 models in two separate recalls due to rising safety concerns. The company wrote to 234,000 owners in December 2015 to ask them to arrange for their car\u0027s heating and ventilation system to be inspected by a local dealer.The initial recall came following reports of nearly 200 of the model bursting into flames.          The British carmaker has been forced into a third recall of the Zafira B range (stock photo) after at least one vehicle reportedly exploded due to overheatingSubsequently all Zafira B owners were offered a free safety inspection in light of the fires. A report by the Commons Transport Select Committee in April 2017 accused Vauxhall of showing a \u0027reckless disregard for safety\u0027 by not stopping motorists driving Zafira B vehicles it knew were a fire risk.The manufacturer was too slow to begin a full investigation, according to the cross-party committee. Vauxhall was also accused of acting prematurely in attributing the problem to improper repairs by third parties, according to the cross-party committee. Concerns that there was a distinctive pattern of fires were first raised within Vauxhall in 2014, but it did not begin an investigation until August 2015. Vauxhall recalls 235,000 Zafira B models for a THIRD time over blaze fears"},{"url":null,"title":"Private school save public 20bn year s claimed","story":"Share this article The Independent Schools Council census shows average boarding school fees are now £34,704 a year, while for day schools it is £14,142. In 2003, it was £16,476 to board, and £6,525 for day schools.         Chairman of the Independent School\u0027s Council Barnaby Lenon (above) said much value is placed on independent schools The figures come amid concerns that middle-class parents are being squeezed out of the sector by soaring costs – although the census did find that more schools are giving out means-tested bursaries to disadvantaged pupils. A total of £420million was dished out this year – an annual increase of 6 per cent. It also showed that despite Brexit uncertainty, European families are still choosing UK private schools.Among the 26,370 non-British pupils whose parents live in the UK, 45 per cent came from European Economic Area countries – up three percentage points from the previous year.While overseas pupils only make up around 5.4 per cent of all pupils, many groups have dramatically increased their numbers as British private schools remain popular among the wealthy global elite.For example, almost 8,000 pupils are now from mainland China – up from around 3,000 in 2009.The schools are also expanding their public benefit activities – 11,466 partnerships with state schools were recorded this year, compared with 10,553 last year.ISC chairman Barnaby Lenon said: ‘While most independent schools are small schools serving their local community, some attract pupils of many different nationalities and these young people have a positive influence on our ability to understand other cultures as well as the country’s economy and our intellectual base.’Mr Lenon added: ‘It is perhaps surprising to see an increase in the number of EEA pupils at ISC schools given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, but clearly much value is placed on the broad all-round education independent schools offer, their inclusive environments, and commitment to supporting the development of globally conscious young people.‘Looking elsewhere in this year’s census, it is hugely encouraging to see an increase once again in means-tested bursary provision for lower income families, which helps widen access to independent schools.’ "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3871393.1556190941!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm hannah heading for ireland as orange weather alert issued","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWaves crash against the wooden bridge area of the Bull Wall on North Bull Island, Dublin in February.

Jimmy Canavan is third from left on the second row. They say nobody wants to know how the sausage gets made, but in the early 1980s, a team of butchers in Superquinn Northside created one of the classic Irish products - the Superquinn sausage.Even today, after Superquinns around the country were replaced by SuperValu, it retains its original name and is sold with a Superquinn logo on it. Jimmy Canavan , the butchery manager in the store that originated the recipe, recalls the early days of the sausage which became so renowed for the supermarket chain, whose founder Feargal Quinn died on Thursday aged 82.“We had the butchery department in Superquinn Northside, which was a huge business. They loved meat in that area, we would have done over 40 cattle a week,” he remembers. The butchery team needed something to put in the pork section, so they brought in an expert called Mr Flood, a master sausagemaker who came in as a consultant. The team, including butchers Maurice Hobbs and Mark Byrne, travelled to the North to look at machinery. Flood made a few batches of sausages, and then Hobbs took over. “It spread from there,” said Mr Canavan, who actually knew very little about sausage making originally, which would have been left to a tradesman called a baconhand. “It was actually fascinating to see the sausages being made,” he recalls. A few years later, Quinn was with the team when they won sausage of the year.Working as a butcher in Superquinn carried a certain significance, remembers Mr Canavan. “It was fabulous. If you were a Superquinn butcher you were paid a lot more, a bonus every month, a canteen. You were a different class of butcher. Not every Tom, Dick or Harry would get into Superquinn.”The owner, he remembers, was a prominent figure on the floor. He would come every few months to “do the figures” himself. “We used to dread it, we’d be under pressure to get the counter up by nine and he was a stickler for detail.” He remembered Quinn as a thoughtful boss. “He used to come around every Christmas and shake hands, he’d come around to all the different counters, go to everyone in the shop and wish them a happy Christmas… he was very interested in everything.”For more than 30 years it was made in-store by Superquinn butchers and sold fresh to shoppers. When Mr Quinn sold the brand in 2005 the sausage began being made by the Larry Goodman-owned ABP Meats. Speaking about the sausage in 2013, Quinn said: “We thought of price, health and taste. We said we’ll go for taste because nobody who is into healthy eating goes for sausages anyway.”He was inspired by a supermarket in Nuremberg in Germany which built a sausage factory next door and had long queues out the door every morning.Quinn recalled that Superquinn sausages were “by far the dearest sausage”, but rather than acting as a deterrent to shoppers, they were an assurance of quality.“Every time we added an extra penny on to them, they sold more,” he said. Superquinn sausages were made in store and were an immediate success.Sausages are made from pork, pork fat, rusk (a form of hardened bread) and seasoning, most notably salt, pepper, mace and nutmeg. It is the seasoning that frequently differentiates one sausage from another and it is what lies behind Superquinn’s much vaunted “secret recipe”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3871774.1556213111!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national broadband plan set for approval at cost of 3bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinisters and senior officials fear the costs the broadband plan – originally €500 million but now expected to require €3 billion from taxpayers – would explode into a public and political controversy.The Government is set to approve the national broadband plan despite the advice of some senior officials who cautioned that the €3 billion programme did not represent good value for money.According to multiple sources familiar with the discussions surrounding the plan in recent months, the Cabinet is likely to be asked the week after next to sign off on the plan to provide high-speed broadband to all rural areas not served by commercial operators.The Government will then embark on a major publicity drive to sell the plan, with rural-based Ministers taking a lead role.Officials in the Department of Communications have been evaluating the tender submitted by the consortium led by American businessman David McCourt for several months but high-ranking sources say the decision was at least as much political as it was technocratic. Ministers and senior officials feared that the runaway costs of the plan – which was originally tagged to cost €500 million but is now expected to require an investment of €3 billion from taxpayers – would explode into a public and political controversy, especially after recent revelations of escalating costs at the national children’s hospital.Costly alternatives However, they were also fearful that a decision to shelve the project or even to recommence it with an eye to reducing costs would cause outrage in rural Ireland in advance of the local and European elections next month.Ministers are also said to have been convinced to back the current project because any alternative was also likely to have proven very expensive.However, some senior officials in the finance and public expenditure departments are believed to have advised that the project represented poor value for money. Officials in the Department of Communications strongly favoured going ahead with the programme. However, even senior sources who say they favour going ahead with the broadband plan concede there are drawbacks, even if the ballooning costs – which Ministers will stress are spread out over 25-30 years – are accepted.One aspect of the plan likely to be criticised is that the State will not own the network once it is built. In addition, there is significant doubt over the likely take-up of broadband services in remote rural areas even after households have been connected to fibre-optic cable. Last year, The  reported that take-up of broadband services in less-remote rural areas that have been connected by the commercial operators was less than 20 per cent.Tender processThe broadband project – which pledged in 2012 to bring high-speed broadband to every home and business premises in the country by 2020 – has been beset by controversy from the outset. Because commercial operators were not interested in extending their services to the most remote parts of the country, the State pledged to step in and pay for the network to connect the most remote half a million premises. However, all the commercial operators except one dropped out of the tender process, leaving the consortium led by Mr McCourt as the only bidder – a factor officials feared would drive up costs.Last year, then minister for communications Denis Naughten was forced to resign after it was revealed that he had held several private meetings with Mr McCourt, though after a brief investigation, the Government decided to proceed with the tender process.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesNew all-party talks aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland power sharing institutions are to be given a sharp time limit of about three weeks.Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley are set to announce a fresh round of talks on Friday in an attempt to get Stormont back up and running for the first time since January 2017. The institutions collapsed amid controversy over the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.The talks will begin the week after the local elections in Northern Ireland, which take place next Thursday, May 2nd. It is understood the precise details have largely been finalised but have yet to be formally signed off between the British and Irish governments.Public pressure has mounted for the restoration of the Stormont Assembly and the power sharing executive since the murder last week of Lyra McKee, the 29-year-old journalist who was shot in Derry by the New IRA. Earlier this week, both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May attended Lyra McKee’s funeral, which saw Fr Martin Magill challenge politicians as to why it had taken her death to unite them.In talks early last year to resolve the political impasse, issues such as the Irish language, same sex marriage and dealing with the past prevented the parties reaching an agreement. However, significant progress was made on the key issue blocking a deal, the Irish language, with the DUP and Sinn Féin appearing to have signed up to broad all-embracing legislation addressing the Irish language, Ulster Scots and respecting cultural ersity.However at the time the DUP was unable to sell the deal to its grassroots with the result that these talks collapsed in February 2018.Well-placed sources said the new talks would be informed by the last process but the intention of the negotiations is to “broaden out the discussion” in an attempt to seek an agreement. This, it is argued, would ensure the talks do not exclusively focus on areas which caused previous disagreements.The talks would be “focused” and “time limited” for around “three-ish weeks”. It was also acknowledged by well placed figures that the British and Irish governments will need to “step in” and take a strong role in the talks than may have been the case in the past. Speaking on Thursday, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party will not “capitulate” on an Irish language act, adding there was nothing trivial about insisting on equality and rights. DUP leader Arlene Foster repeated her call for Stormont to be restored immediately, with no pre-conditions, and a parallel talks process to deal with issues of disagreement.

These included the time he described his Chinese wife as Japanese, which he said was a result of getting his notes for small talk with China’s foreign minister mixed up.But on his ambition to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader, he said “wait and see”, suggesting that such speculation was unseemly. “I don’t think it’s the time to be talking about Prime Minister Hunt because we’ve got Prime Minister May,” he said.But he was quick to reject the idea that the next Conservative leader must be someone who had voted for Brexit in 2016, saying that it should be someone who “believes in Brexit”, as he says he does.May promised last month that she would step down in time for a new prime minister to take charge of the next phase of Brexit negotiations. But backbenchers became restless when Downing Street suggested that, since the next stage of the Brexit talks could not begin until the withdrawal agreement was ratified, her departure would have to wait.This week, the backbench 1922 committee rejected a proposal to allow May to face a confidence vote as early as June by changing the rule that made her immune from a challenge for a year after she won a confidence vote last December. But the committee asked the prime minister to outline a clear “road map” for her exit to reassure backbenchers that she was not planning to squat in Downing Street until the end of the year.Hunt is one of a number of ministers whose leadership campaigns are already under way but a Conservative Home poll of party members last week identified Boris Johnson as the runaway favourite. When May announces her resignation, Conservative MPs will choose two candidates to go before the entire party membership in a postal ballot.‘Leave quickly’At least one of the two candidates is likely to be a hard Brexiteer and Johnson’s strongest rival in that lane is former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. Although Johnson is viewed as unbeatable if he gets on to the ballot, his unpopularity among MPs means that he is not guaranteed to be one of the two candidates.Raab is a less appealing and less well-known candidate who could prove vulnerable if his record is subjected to intense scrutiny. This means that an alternative candidate promising responsible and competent leadership could emerge as the winner.Hunt is the leading candidate of the centre but he knows that he must demonstrate his credentials as a born-again Brexiteer if he is to have any hope of winning over the party membership.“We have to leave, we have to leave quickly, we have to leave cleanly. And I see Brexit as the biggest democratic challenge that we’ve had in our lifetimes. Because the political establishment, myself included, didn’t want Brexit or vote for Brexit. And yet we’ve always been telling people we are one of the oldest and greatest democracies in the world,” he said on Thursday.‘Risk of no Brexit’Hunt said the measure of Brexit’s success will be if Britain’s economy grows faster than those of other European countries over the next 10 years. But he is prepared to countenance leaving the EU without a deal, despite the economic disruption it would cause.“If there was a binary choice between no deal or no Brexit I would choose no deal because I believe the democratic risk of no Brexit ultimately is higher than the economic risk of no deal. But the reality is that this parliament won’t allow no deal and I personally don’t think we should go back to the country and try to get a different parliament until we’ve left Europe, ” he said on Thursday.\u0026nbsp“I’ve always preferred to leave with a deal because I believe there will be disruption without a deal and it’s very difficult to predict exactly what that disruption would be but I think it would potentially be very significant and that’s something that I think anyone sensible would wish to avoid.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jane BarlowPA Conservative MPs have asked Theresa May to set out clearly when she will resign but they rejected a proposal to allow a confidence vote in her leadership as early as June. The backbench 1922 Committee voted against a change to the rule that leaves the prime minister immune to a leadership challenge before next December.“We looked at the fact that the prime minister gave a very firm timetable for her departure as leader a few weeks ago in the eventuality that the withdrawal agreement is passed in parliament. We have resolved to request that she sets a similarly clear timetable or schedule for her departure as leader in other circumstances. So real clarity for colleagues in parliament and for the Conservative Party in general,” the committee’s chairman Graham Brady said.Mrs May promised her backbenchers last month that she would resign in time for a new leader to take charge of “the second phase of the Brexit negotiations”. After the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement and the EU agreed to delay Brexit until the end of October, the prime minister’s allies suggested that she would stay in Downing Street until her Brexit deal was approved.Brexit party threatShe is now under pressure to outline what Sir Graham called a “roadmap” towards her resignation, which some Conservative MPs believe will become inevitable if the party contests European Parliament elections on May 23rd. Polls point to a collapse in the Conservative vote as supporters switch to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which announced on Wednesday that former Tory frontbencher Anne Widdecombe will stand as one of its candidates next month.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond told a Commons committee on Wednesday that the legal default remained leaving the EU without a deal at the end of October. He said that business investment in Britain was 20 per cent below the figure expected before the 2016 referendum.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would introduce legislation allowing for a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if Brexit goes ahead. But she declined to set a date for a referendum and said she would establish citizens’ assemblies to\u0026nbspconsider Scotland’s constitutional future.“We have seen in Westminster what happens when parties fail to work together when leaders take a ‘my way or the highway’ approach and when so many red lines and inflexible preconditions are set that progress becomes impossible,” she told the Scottish parliament.SNP isions“This place was established with the hope that it would be a new type of parliament. We can show that we are able to put the interests of the people first. So if others across this chamber are willing to move forward in that spirit, they will find in me an equally willing partner.”Opposition leaders accused the first minister of seeking to paper over isions within her Scottish National Party (SNP) about a second independence referendum rather than uniting Scotland.“Nicola Sturgeon is using her office as first minister to put the interests of the SNP before the interests of our country,” Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said.\u0026nbsp“Her statement today is not about Brexit this is about Nicola Sturgeon trying to pacify her party members and backbenchers ahead of the SNP conference. The chaos of Brexit throws into sharp relief the challenges of leaving a political and economic union. Leaving the UK would lead to unprecedented austerity for Scotland’s public services.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignSocial care at \u0026#39crisis point\u0026#39 as fewer people getting the care they need, study findsInstagram replacing travel brochures as survey finds social media influencing half of holidaymakers\u0026#39 choicesSri Lanka bomber Jameel Mohamed \u0026#39under police surveillance\u0026#39 while he plotted attackComment: The Huawei leak inquiry must not endanger the freedom of the pressTory candidate punched by stranger blames toxic online political climatepolitan Police rejects MP’s call for a \u0026#39proactive\u0026#39 approach over allegations into Sir Philip GreenJill Dando: 20 Year Mystery, review: this film revived hope of finding her killerOne in five Scots back Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s plan for second independence referendum within two yearsHuawei row: How the Government dug itself into a hole hunting for the 5G moleComment: A phoney war between old and young is no way to secure the Conservatives\u0026#39 futureCabinet ministers go public to deny leaking details of Huawei affair as Theresa May orders investigationWhite supremacist executed in Texas, 20 years on from black man\u0026#39s torture and murderIncredible video shows monkey using a smartphone to browse InstagramTheresa May\u0026#39s decision to give green light to Huawei is \u0026#39appalling\u0026#39, former head of MI6 says\u0026#39Lost portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh\u0026#39 spotted on eBay by amateur art historianComment: I broke the Huawei 5G story – its huge ramifications must be open to public debateJeremy Hunt dismisses Iran prisoner exchange to free Nazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeComment: Dear Leavers, Lord Adonis doesn\u0026#39t want your support, but my Brexit Party certainly doesJapan warns that no deal Brexit must be avoided at all costs at Brussels summitPolice ‘ignored’ calls claiming Jill Dando killing was Serbian revenge hit, claims new documentaryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/25/TELEMMGLPICT000195151852_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqUw66vBYdg1kuDhmFbOI952ZmnGJJdkbeSLIsm08GPQU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"lost portrait sir walter raleigh identified amateur art historian","story":"The portrait features an inscription that matches Raleigh\u0026#39s mottoArts and Entertainment EditorTower of LondonWhen the painting of an unknown man was sold at Bonhams in 2012 for a few thousand pounds, it was simply described as “portrait of a cleric”.Thanks to the work of an amateur art historian, it could now fetch many times that sum after being identified as a lost portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh.Lesley Wood spotted the picture on the eBay site of an art dealer who had purchased it at auction. She bought it on a hunch after studying its details and spotting that an inscription in the top corner, Amore et Virtute, was Raleigh’s motto.The unsigned portrait is now being sold as the last known portrait of Raleigh, dated to 1613 when he was incarcerated in the Tower of London. He was held there from 1603-16 after being implicated in a plot against James I. He was executed in 1618.Ms Wood said her research has identified the painting as ‘The Tower Portrait’, referred to in John Aubrey’s Brief Lives, a collection of biographies published in the latter half of the 17th century. That portrait was said to have been acquired by a clergyman, Dr Robert Burhill, and passed down through his family until it was lost.Ms Wood became interested in Sir Walter Raleigh after studying the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods for her MA in English Literature at Oxford.A detail from the paintingShe said: “I have never bought anything from eBay before or since, but I saw this painting and it drew me in. I sat up all night researching it.”In 2014, Ms Wood had the painting x-rayed and analysed under infra-red by the Hamilton Kerr Institute, part of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, which confirmed it dates back to the early 17th century.The painting remained on her wall until she moved to Switzerland recently to take up a job at an international school. “I couldn’t bring it with me because of the climate so I realised I just had to sell it. I am ever so fond of it but circumstances mean I can’t keep it,” she said.Although a prisoner in the Tower, Raleigh had two rooms and was allowed servants and visitors. In 1613 he was working on his History of the World, which was published the following year.According to the auction house, Raleigh is wearing black in the picture because he was in mourning for Prince Henry, who had just died.The painting will go under the hammer at Duke’s of Dorchester today with a “conservative” estimate of £6,000 but could fetch six figures, according to one expert.Guy Schwinge, selling the painting for Duke’s auctioneers, said: “It is impossible to say with 100 per cent certainty that this is a portrait of Raleigh, but all the facts point to it being him.“Paintings of Raleigh are extremely rare and those that exist are in museums. It is extraordinary that this one’s whereabouts were unknown for so long. We are confident it is not a forgery.”Others sounded a note of caution. Dr Anna Beer, author of Patriot or Traitor: The Life and Death of Sir Walter Ralegh, said Raleigh was persona non grata by 1613 and it was unlikely he would have been granted permission to sit for a portrait.Tower of LondonSocial care at \u0026#39crisis point\u0026#39 as fewer people getting the care they need, study findsInstagram replacing travel brochures as survey finds social media influencing half of holidaymakers\u0026#39 choicesSri Lanka bomber Jameel Mohamed \u0026#39under police surveillance\u0026#39 while he plotted attackComment: The Huawei leak inquiry must not endanger the freedom of the pressTory candidate punched by stranger blames toxic online political climatepolitan Police rejects MP’s call for a \u0026#39proactive\u0026#39 approach over allegations into Sir Philip GreenJill Dando: 20 Year Mystery, review: this film revived hope of finding her killerOne in five Scots back Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s plan for second independence referendum within two yearsComment: A phoney war between old and young is no way to secure the Conservatives\u0026#39 futureCabinet ministers go public to deny leaking details of Huawei affair as Theresa May orders investigationHuawei row: How the Government dug itself into a hole hunting for the 5G moleWhite supremacist executed in Texas, 20 years on from black man\u0026#39s torture and murderIncredible video shows monkey using a smartphone to browse InstagramTheresa May\u0026#39s decision to give green light to Huawei is \u0026#39appalling\u0026#39, former head of MI6 saysComment: I broke the Huawei 5G story – its huge ramifications must be open to public debateJeremy Hunt dismisses Iran prisoner exchange to free Nazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeComment: Dear Leavers, Lord Adonis doesn\u0026#39t want your support, but my Brexit Party certainly doesJapan warns that no deal Brexit must be avoided at all costs at Brussels summitPolice ‘ignored’ calls claiming Jill Dando killing was Serbian revenge hit, claims new documentaryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 25 april 2019","story":"Police remove Extinction Rebellion climate protesters at London\u0027s Marble Arch during ongoing planned protests in the capital. Social care at \u0026#39crisis point\u0026#39 as fewer people getting the care they need, study findsInstagram replacing travel brochures as survey finds social media influencing half of holidaymakers\u0026#39 choicesSri Lanka bomber Jameel Mohamed \u0026#39under police surveillance\u0026#39 while he plotted attackComment: The Huawei leak inquiry must not endanger the freedom of the pressTory candidate punched by stranger blames toxic online political climatepolitan Police rejects MP’s call for a \u0026#39proactive\u0026#39 approach over allegations into Sir Philip GreenJill Dando: 20 Year Mystery, review: this film revived hope of finding her killerOne in five Scots back Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s plan for second independence referendum within two yearsHuawei row: How the Government dug itself into a hole hunting for the 5G moleComment: A phoney war between old and young is no way to secure the Conservatives\u0026#39 futureCabinet ministers go public to deny leaking details of Huawei affair as Theresa May orders investigationWhite supremacist executed in Texas, 20 years on from black man\u0026#39s torture and murderIncredible video shows monkey using a smartphone to browse InstagramTheresa May\u0026#39s decision to give green light to Huawei is \u0026#39appalling\u0026#39, former head of MI6 says\u0026#39Lost portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh\u0026#39 spotted on eBay by amateur art historianComment: I broke the Huawei 5G story – its huge ramifications must be open to public debateJeremy Hunt dismisses Iran prisoner exchange to free Nazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeComment: Dear Leavers, Lord Adonis doesn\u0026#39t want your support, but my Brexit Party certainly doesJapan warns that no deal Brexit must be avoided at all costs at Brussels summitPolice ‘ignored’ calls claiming Jill Dando killing was Serbian revenge hit, claims new documentaryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/07/13/16/rambo.jpg  layout= fill  alt= Rambo (2008)  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/07/13/16/rambo.jpg","title":"bond 25 rami malek cast daniel craig 007 bohemian rhapsody","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

This came after an initial run during which members of the Nazi Party disrupted screenings by releasing mice into the cinema and, at one stage, attacking Jewish audience members. Censors in Austria, Australia, Italy and France also banned the film in the early 1930s.Many might find Clint Eastwood\u0027s American Sniper (2015) to be something of an insult, but Iran banned the war drama – based on the life of the US military\u0027s deadliest marksman – for being just that. Censors deemed it offensive to its nation.The anti-war sentiment present in Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s Apocalypse Now saw the film banned under President Park Chung-hee\u0027s regime in 1979.Ben Affleck\u0027s Best Picture-winning 2012 drama Argo was banned in Iran due to its negative portrayal of the country.Finnish censors believed that Sergei Eisenstein\u0027s 1925 Soviet silent film Battleship Potemkin would incite a Communist revolution, so gave the film an outright ban.746 Beauty and the Beast (2017)Disney\u0027s live-action remake of its 1991 classic was banned in Kuwait due to homosexual references involving the character LeFou (Josh Gad). It evaded a ban in Russia after being slapped with a 16+ age certificate and in Malaysia after having the references cut altogether.China banned William Wyler\u0027s religious epic Ben-Hur in 1959 under the regime of Mao Zedong for containing propaganda of superstitious beliefs, namely Christianity. While most films go on to have their ban lifted, the country has never given the Oscar-winner permission to be shown.It turns out there are some people who don\u0027t find Sacha Baron Cohen that funny, notably officials in all Arab countries (except Lebanon) who banned his 2006 comedy Borat for being too offensive.Officials in the Catholic country of Ireland found David Lean\u0027s romantic drama Brief Encounter to be too accepting of adultery to be shown in cinemas.The homosexual relationship at the centre of Ang Lee\u0027s 2005 drama Brokeback Mountain saw the film banned in all Arab countries bar Lebanon, where it was released in a censored format.The number of banned films in North Korea runs pretty high, but an unexpected feature on the list is the Tom Hardy-starring Child 44 (2015). Countries including Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus all followed suit.Censors in China denied the release of Disney\u0027s Christopher Robin in 2008 because the character of Winnie the Pooh has become a symbol of resistance against the country’s ruling Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping.Stanley Kubrick met a lot of opposition with A Clockwork Orange in 1971. While the film was never banned outright in the UK (it was withdrawn at the director\u0027s request after his family received death threats because of it), it wasn\u0027t shown in cinemas in Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea due to its depictions of violence and gang rape. It wasn\u0027t screened in the UK until after Kubrick\u0027s death in 1999.The high-profile adaptation of Dan Brown\u0027s novel The Da Vinci Code was banned in (take a deep breath) China, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Samoa and Solomon Islands due to content deemed blasphemous.The Danish Girl, Tom Hooper\u0027s film inspired by the life of transgender painter Lili Elbe, was banned in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia on grounds of moral depravity in 2015.After it was decided that Deadpool couldn\u0027t be edited without affecting its plot, Chinese officials initially banned the film citing explicit content. Uzbekistan followed suit as the film violated the country\u0027s societal norms, while it received heavy editing in order to be shown in India.1846 The Death of Stalin (2017)Armando Iannucci\u0027s 2017 comedy The Death of Stalin failed to make the cut in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan because of its perceived anti-Soviet theme.Martin Scorsese\u0027s crime thriller The Departed hit a nerve with China in 2006 thanks to a line of dialogue that suggested its government intends to use nuclear weapons on Taiwan, a sensitive issue for the country. The ban has never been lifted.District 9, Neill Blomkamp\u0027s science-fiction film from 2009, was slapped with a ban in Nigeria due to accusations of being xenophobic and racist towards its citizens.2146 Fifty Shades of Grey (2015)The adaptation of EL James\u0027s erotic drama Fifty Shades of Grey may not have been as raunchy as some were hoping, but it was considered too explicit for audiences in Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe.   William Wyler\u0027s romantic musical Funny Girl was banned in Egypt because its male lead Omar Sharif – an Egyptian Muslim – is shown in a romantic storyline with the Jewish Barbra Streisand, who was vocal in her political support for Israel at the height of military tensions with Egypt in 1968.Paul Feig\u0027s all-female reboot of Ghostbusters was denied a release in China due to censorship laws prohibiting the promotion of cults and superstitions.

When the house was sold after his death in 1993, the archive was moved to Manchester, where it is being catalogued by the International Anthony Burgess Foundation.Burgess himself described the work as a “major philosophical statement on the contemporary human condition”, outlining his concerns about the effect on humanity of technology, in particular media, film and television.Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England.

Whishaw stepped in as Q for those same two films, which also saw Harris make her debut as Eve Moneypenny.Richard Madden’s Bodyguard future ‘depends on what happens with Bond’ Bohemian Rhapsody Oscar-winner Rami Malek has finally been confirmed to appear after months of rumours. He confirmed he’ll be playing the film’s villain.Speaking about his appointment, Malek said: “I am very much looking forward to joining the cast and crew very soon. I will be making sure that Bond does not have an easy ride on his 25th outing, I can’t wait to see you all soon.”Malek\u0026nbsphad previously said in response to the rumours: “We’ll have to see about that. It would be nice to play a villain, that would be another dream role for me, I’ve got to play so many great ones so far so who knows. I’m keeping tight-lipped.”Magnussen is\u0026nbsprumoured to be playing a CIA operative that crosses paths with Bond.\u0026nbspThe film has an official working title. Subscribers to\u0026nbspProduction Weekly\u0026nbspnoticed in a new update listing that the next 007 outing will shoot under the title\u0026nbspShatterhand , but there is no indication whether this will be the final title for the film.\u0026nbsp“Shatterhand” is the alias used by Blofeld – who was played in the last Bond film,\u0026nbspSpectre,\u0026nbspby Christoph Waltz – in the\u0026nbspYou Only Live Twice\u0026nbspnovel.Idris Elba jokes about James Bond rumours on red carpetReports suggest that the film would be based on the 2001 novel Never Dream of Dying by Raymond Benson. The story sees Bond start a relationship with Tylyn Mignonne, a film star whose husband is connected to The Union, a recurring crime organisation within the 007 novel series.Fukunaga confirmed the story will bring things full circle for Craig by continuing the arc first presented in Casino Royale, his first outing as 007.Created with Sketch.

We’ve got quite a ride in store for Mr Bond.”We also know that Bond’s peace\u0026nbspis short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter\u0026nbsp(Wright) from the CIA turns up asking for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.On top of Fukunaga, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have drafted a version of the script, though studio executives were reportedly unhappy with the results.\u0026nbspScott Z Burns, who scripted The Bourne Ultimatum and wrote the upcoming Steven Soderbergh film The Laundromat, joined the project in February as a script doctor\u0026nbspalongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge.Production on the film is set to begin on 6 April in London’s Pinewood Studios before heading to Matera in Italy. \u0026nbspBond 25 was originally scheduled to be released on 8 November before moving to 14 February 2020.

Léa Seydoux has been a household name in France for over a decade now, ever since 2008’s La Belle Personne earned the then-23-year-old a César nomination (essentially the French equivalent of an Oscar) for Most Promising Actress. She lived up to that promise – but it took a few more years for English-speaking audiences to catch on. Now, as she prepares to reprise her role as Bond girl Madeleine Swann\u0026nbspin the next 007 film, she’s become a major Hollywood player.Born in Paris, the daughter of a businessman and a philanthropist, Léa Hélène Seydoux-Fornier de Clausonne – who wisely shortened her name to Léa Seydoux – started out in music videos and short films before landing her starring role as a beguiling schoolgirl in La Belle Personne. From there, she had small parts in two English-language blockbusters: Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, in which she played cool assassin Sabine Moreau, and Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds (2009).But it was in 2013, when she starred in the brilliant, beguiling Blue Is the Warmest Colour alongside Adèle Exarchopoulos, that Seydoux’s star ascended worldwide. Since then, she has appeared in Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Lobster (2015), Xavier Dolan’s It’s Only the End of the World (2016), and – of course – the 2015 James Bond film Spectre. It’s rare for a Bond girl to return for a second film, but Seydoux is a rare kind of actor. Here are her five most essential roles.Director Christophe Honoré was inspired to make this film after then French president Nicolas Sarkozy mocked its source material, the 17th-century novel La Princesse de Clèves, declaring it irrelevant to modern life. Honoré transported his version into the modern day, casting the unknown Seydoux as a schoolgirl who embarks on an affair with her Italian teacher. Its title literally translates to The Beautiful Person, but there was far more to Seydoux’s Junie than that. Though the film was met with lukewarm reviews, her performance, described by New York Times critic AO Scott as one of “voluptuous sullenness”, stood out. \u0026nbspThis sensitive, low-key portrayal of an impoverished brother and sister living on the outskirts of a Swiss ski resort was longlisted for the Best Foreign Language Oscar. As the (significantly) older sibling, Seydoux’s Louise should be the provider and nurturer of the two, but she is unemployed and perennially selfish, so the burden falls on 12-year-old Simon (Kacey Mottet Klein), who steals equipment from wealthy skiers.

The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1321 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1421 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1721 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2121 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 421 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate.

In recent years, a significant and growing number of mysterious aircraft, referred to as “unexplained aerial phenomena”,\u0026nbsphave been spotted in by pilots.It is now happening sometimes many times per month, and the US have no official explanation for what the aircraft – which is often described as being strange in appearance, and flying more quickly than US planes – could actually be.Now the Navy is putting in place new systems that will allow those pilots to report any more they see. The new process should allow them to report them more easily and without being embarrassed to do so.It is part of a new effort to try and find what the UFOs actually are, and where they have come from.\u0026nbsp“Since 2014, these intrusions have been happening on a regular basis,” Joseph\u0026nbspGradisher, spokesman for office of the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, told the Washington Post.“We want to get to the bottom of this. We need to determine who’s doing it, where it’s coming from and what their intent is. We need to try to find ways to prevent it from happening again.”UFOs spotted by pilots off Ireland coastHe told the paper that the military would now commit to investigating every report.The major change in policy from the US Navy comes after official reports were released which showed UFOs being chased by pilots, and detailed strange materials recovered by the Pentagon that officials say they do not recognise.Pilots have described seeing white and strangely shaped vehicles that appear to be propelled without air intakes or exhausts, and no obvious ways of flying through the air.But those same pilots – despite often having training in engineering – are said to be afraid of reporting the strange sightings. They are scared of speaking up because they may damage their careers, and there is often little interest in investigating the claims.The change of policy will allow pilots to report them and make sure they are passed on to the relevant authorities, the Navy said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will likely result in a corresponding dip after the eventual departure date as companies slow down production while they run down the stocks they’ve built up.Some have suggested that this will result in a mini-recession as the UK’s already slow rate of economic growth tips into a decline.However, is there a possibility that such an effect would be more than offset by companies who feel finally able to turn on the taps of investment after more than three years of uncertainty?Could the fabled “Brexit bounce” or a “deal idend” really rescue the UK’s struggling economy?Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersIt is certainly the case that companies have held back billions of pounds of investment in new offices, factories, machinery, training and technology since the June 2016 referendum. The exact amount is hard to quantify but the available data points to a significant sum.\u0026nbspWith consumers for the large part continuing to spend despite uncertainty and meagre wage increases, it has been a lack of business investment that has been largely responsible for holding back growth to the tune of around £800m a week – £40bn a year – since the vote.This makes sense. Many consumer decisions are small scale and have so far, apart from the effects of higher inflation, have been largely unaffected by the vagaries of trade deals.\u0026nbspNorway-plus, Canada-plus, no deal or the Swiss option matters little to most people when weighing up options for a new washing machine or doing their weekly shopBut the differences between the possible trade deal outcomes could be huge for a company looking at a multimillion-pound investment in the UK that will pay off (or not) over several years. As a result, firms have understandably not made those decisions, or have chosen to invest elsewhere.Is a customs union really ‘the worst of both worlds’ for the UK?Ignoring the younger generation may prove perilous for businessIs Brexit making the eurozone’s economic problems worse?The flip side of this, so the argument goes, is that when executives and small business owners are given certainty as to what our trading relationship with the EU will look like, the floodgates will open and billions of pounds of pent-up investment will gush forth.Sadly it is not as simple as this.According to Bank of England interest-rate setter Jonathan Haskel, British business investment will probably stay weak for the next few years because uncertainty is likely to continue, at least for the 21-month transition period and potentially beyond.“The longer-term question is whether investment will eventually bounce back after uncertainty is resolved,” he said, adding that the answer to this depends on the perennial, unanswered question of what trade deal is to be struck and how high trade barriers will be.“At least for the next few years the prospect of low investment seems possible.”Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The public accounts committee lambasted Mr Grayling’s team for continual shortcomings\u0026nbspand said the project had been afflicted by\u0026nbspan overriding culture of over-optimism”.Earlier this month, MPs said it was unacceptable that DfT and Crossrail had not identified root causes of delays and cost increases, and demanded to know what consequences officials had faced for the string of failings.Crossrail’s\u0026nbsporiginal budget was £15bn, but it is thought to have run over by £3bn so far. The company said it had now developed\u0026nbspa robust and realistic plan\u0026nbspthat took full account of exactly what was to be done and how long it would take.Its chairman, Tony Meggs, said in a statement: “An enhanced governance structure has been put in place to strengthen the Crossrail programme.“We will be open and transparent about our progress and will be providing Londoners and London businesses with regular updates as we seek to rebuild trust with all our stakeholders.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite ministers’ attempts to explain away food bank use, the\u0026nbspTrussell\u0026nbspTrust is very clear that cuts to social security and the five-week wait for universal credit payments are key reasons for the rise,” she added.The\u0026nbspTrussell Trust said the main reasons for people needing emergency food were benefits consistently not covering the cost of living (33 per cent), and delays or changes to benefits being paid, and urged ministers to scrap the five-week wait for a first universal credit payment.Emma Revie, chief executive of the charity, said: “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty. Universal credit should be part of the solution but currently the five-week wait is leaving many without enough money to cover the basics.”She urged the government to ensure benefit payments reflected the true cost of living and that work was secure and people were paid the real living wage, to help ensure everyone is “anchored from poverty”.\u0026nbsp“As a priority, we’re urging the government to end the wait for universal credit to ease the pressure on thousands of households,” she added.“Ultimately, it’s unacceptable that anyone should have to use a food bank in the first place. No charity can replace the dignity of having financial security.”Universal credit to blame for soaring food bank use, government admitsA study by the Resolution Foundation in February found that child poverty risked hitting a record high by 2023-24 unless the government implements substantial changes to universal credit and other benefits.The UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights meanwhile warned in November that policies and drastic cuts to social support were entrenching high levels of poverty, and that Brexit was exacerbating the problem.Campbell Robb, chief executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, attributed the rise in food bank use to the government’s “consistent failure to get to grips with poverty”.\u0026nbsp“When the use of food banks reaches a record high we are beyond the language of warning signs and wake-up calls. Unless we take bold action to solve poverty we risk undermining what we stand for as a country,” he added.“Low pay, insecure work, high cost of living, especially housing, and an ineffective social security system are holding people back from a decent life. At a time when we are deciding the future of our country we must redesign the systems that lock so many people in poverty.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Extinction Rebellion protesters (left to right) Alan Heath, 55, research scientist, Jen Witts, 38, support worker for vulnerable people, Sian Vaughan 53, retired head teacher, Debbie Rees, 57, Gardener and artist, Kef Shimidzu, 55, tutor and learning support worker, Lucy Galvin, 53, civil servant and Johnny Woon, 60, retired, glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange in the City of LondonEngineers from the Canal and River Trust repair a leak at the base of a deep 200 year old, Grade II listed lock in Gloucester, where the tidal River Severn meets Gloucester Docks in the city and a specially manufactured steel dam is now holding back the river water, with more than 100 tonnes of accumulated silt being removed from the damaged area of the lock so that the team can undertake repairsAmateur James Cahill celebrates beating snooker world number one, Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan, in the first round of the World Championship.

Allies of the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have previously briefed that\u0026nbsphe will be sitting this one out. “He believes the prospect of the UK fielding candidates is utterly preposterous,” one told The Times.It is quite extraordinary on one level that the government is avoiding relatively simple questions on an election that is likely to take place in just four weeks’ time.\u0026nbspUnder the current terms of the revised\u0026nbspArticle 50 Brexit negotiating deadline, the UK does not have to take part\u0026nbspin the European elections if a deal is secured in the British parliament by the end of play on 22\u0026nbspMay. However,\u0026nbspif no deal is done, then the British public will be heading to the polls on the following day to elect the next crop of MEPs.\u0026nbspGiven that no agreement in the cross-party talks over Brexit appear imminent, it seems fairly unlikely the prime minister will receive MPs’ backing for a Brexit plan\u0026nbspin just a matter of weeks.Experts have also warned that\u0026nbspeven if Ms May secures approval in principle, she has “no chance” of formally passing her deal\u0026nbspin time to pull the UK out of the elections and to avoid what many speculate will be a devastating set of results for the party.But confusion will reign over the Conservative Party’s strategy for the European parliament election campaign for as long as the prime minister clings to the hope she can win parliamentary approval for\u0026nbspa deal by\u0026nbsp22 May.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

preparations for the upcoming European parliament elections amid fears that millions of EU citizens in the UK could be deprived of their\u0026nbspvote.Under current rules, EU citizens must\u0026nbspregister to vote and also\u0026nbspsign\u0026nbspa special form stating that they are not also voting in any other EU country, known as a “UC1”, by 7 May.But chaos surrounding the date of the UK’s departure from the EU means the form was only sent to 2 million European nationals on the electoral register a few weeks before the deadline – instead of the usual four-month period.A leading organisation, representing EU citizens in the UK, has urged ministers to take immediate action to remedy the situation – or face potential legal action.Roger Casale, secretary general of the New Europeans, said: “Because of the very tight timetable, we would urge the government to allow those EU citizens on the electoral roll, who miss the current 7 May\u0026nbspdeadline, to fill in the required UC1 declaration forms when they arrive at their local polling stations on 23 May.”Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created

judicial review to ensure that people are able to fully participate in the democratic process.“But if the government does not take rapid remedial action, we will of course have to consider taking legal action.”Maike Bohn, a co-founder of EU citizens group the3million, said they were being treated as “an afterthought” by the government.No-deal Brexit better than staying in EU, Jeremy Hunt saysPolice call to alter ‘outdated’ protest law amid Brexit threats to MPsTory MPs’ latest bid to topple Theresa May failsHunt hits back at French diplomat who said UK influence in US vanishedCould a ‘Brexit bounce’ rescue our struggling economy?She told The Independent: “I find it really disappointing that the UK makes it so hard for EU citizens to register and to kind of blame Brexit.“I just think it is an afterthought and I think it’s very problematic that so many millions of people still have no voice in their home country.”Ms Bohn, a German citizen who has lived in the UK for 25 years, added: “We do become voiceless. In a country where we pay taxes, I do think that’s really problematic.“It also is very telling about how removed the EU is from the mind of British politicians.”The issue was raised in the Commons by Labour MP Catherine West who expressed concern the rule will “disenfranchise” EU citizens as the majority of EU registers are now closed, meaning people will be unable to vote if they don’t register in the UK in time.She said: “These unusual circumstances and the government’s complete lack of action have helped create an artificial barrier to the enfranchisement of EU citizens.\u0026nbsp“We are already hearing reports of a formal legal challenge to the government. Yet another Brexit mistake.”Ms West called for an end to\u0026nbsp“government-sanctioned barriers” to voting and demanded\u0026nbspEU citizens\u0026nbspbe automatically registered if they had signed up to vote in local government elections on 2 May.Cabinet office minister Brandon Lewis defended the plan in the Commons, saying: “It is important that we ensure that everyone is aware of what they can do to make sure they are able to exercise their right to vote, should that opportunity arise.”He added: “It is to ensure EU citizens do not vote twice, both here and in their EU state of origin. Obviously it is illegal to vote twice in the same election.”The row stems from Theresa May’s insistence that Brexit would be delivered on time, which would have seen the UK leave the bloc on 29 March\u0026nbspand removed the need for the UK to send MEPs to Brussels.But parliament repeatedly rejected her Brexit deal, forcing the prime minister to seek a delay to the UK’s departure until October.In reality,\u0026nbspUK participation has been a distinct possibility since December when it became increasingly clear that Ms May might not win parliamentary approval for her deal.But the government insisted on denying that there was any possibility of UK participation and even went as far as refusing to help with contingency planning, according to the\u0026nbsporganisation representing local authority electoral officials​.“We approached civil servants on a number of occasions to discuss key potential European parliament election registration and organisational challenges, but they were unwilling to engage with us on the subject as, in their view, there was not going to be an election in the UK, ” said Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA).The Electoral Commission gave assurances to a Commons committee in 2014 that\u0026nbspthere would be changes to the system but plans were scrapped after the Brexit vote in 2016.EU citizens, this is what you need to do to safeguard your stayIt told the Political and Constitutional Affairs committee (PACAC) that it would “continue to work with the UK government, electoral registration officers and organisations representing citizens of other EU member states in the UK to identify what can be done to simplify the system and remove unnecessary administrative barriers to participation so that this problem does not affect electors at the next European parliament elections in 2019”.If the government now fails to take remedial action (by substantially extending the UC1 form completion deadline, potentially till polling day), it could lay itself open to legal challenge.David Howarth, professor of law and public policy at the University of Cambridge, believes that the government might face legal action for not having given enough time for EU nationals to complete their UC1 declaration forms.Any challenge “would presumably be based on Article 12 of the 1993 Directive, which requires member states to inform EU nationals of the conditions and detailed arrangements for the exercise of their right to vote ‘in good time’, which the government has plainly failed to do,” he said.“Doing nothing about the situation serves no legitimate purpose – or, if it does serve a legitimate purpose, the interference with the right to vote is so serious that it will be argued that it outweighs that purpose,” said Professor Howarth.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any decision to prosecute would have to be taken by Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general.The mood at the NSC\u0026nbspmeeting where the decision was made was said to have been tense and fraught with most of those attending leaving grim-faced when it ended at about 4pm.The leak, the first one on a major issue since the NSC was formed, came in the next three hours, and is being viewed in Whitehall as designed to show the toughness of a cabinet minister with aspirations to the leadership after Theresa May goes.Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary and Penny Mordaunt, the international development\u0026nbspsecretary, are all said to have objected strongly to the participation of Huawei in a key sector of the UK’s communications network.The multinational, which was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei (a former member of the People’s Liberation Army technical ision with connections to the military hierarchy and the ruling Communist Party), has been repeatedly accused of being an intelligence arm of the Beijing government.An investigation under the Official Secrets Act would involve Scotland Yard’s Special Branch and, possibly, GCHQ if a minister’s communications and those of his staff are tracked. As well as the possibility of a\u0026nbspCabinet Office\u0026nbspinquiry\u0026nbspthere are also suggestions that the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) can carry out its own inquiry, but the mechanics for this remains unclear.Fury over unprecedented National Security Council leak on Huawei talksBritain’s Huawei gamble would be a grave moral misjudgementOf course the PM is useless, she’s letting Huawei build our 5G networkMPs to probe fears that China will use Huawei to snoop on UK Huawei: Should it be allowed in Britain’s 5G networks? Dominic Grieve, the ISC chair, said the leak was “deeply worrying” and that if any minister was found to be responsible they should be sacked.He told the BBC: “The principle that what is discussed at the NSC is kept totally confidential is really important. The problem that we have at the moment is that collective cabinet responsibility has been breaking down and we have seen plenty of leaks come out of cabinet meetings.“There has certainly been some posturing around on a whole range of issues. I can’t pretend that there aren’t people who appear to be preparing themselves for leadership bids.”Huawei has been banned from the networks of a number of countries, many of them allies of the UK.Rob Joyce, a senior adviser at the US National Security Agency, who was attending a cybersecurity conference in Glasgow said: “We have got to understand all the details of that and decide what that means. What we will be insistent on is UK decisions can’t put our information at risk but the good news is that the UK already understands that.”GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming,\u0026nbspwho was also at the Glasgow conference, stated technical factors were more important than flag of origin. He continued: “A flag of origin of 5G equipment is important but it is a secondary factor. It’s a hugely complex strategic challenge, going to  the next few decades. How we deal with it will be crucial for our prosperity and for our security.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is not what we expected,” says Adam\u0026nbspRiess, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of physics and astronomy at\u0026nbspJohns Hopkins University, Nobel laureate and the project’s leader.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

But it has repeatedly been observed to behave unexpectedly – the more astronomers find out about it, the more wrong it appears –\u0026nbspin ways that have forced scientists to wonder whether our assumptions about it had been wrong.The new study confirms that speculation, and requires further work to explain how exactly the universe is growing.The research saw Professor Riess and his team analyse light from 70 stars in a galaxy near ours, known as\u0026nbspthe Large\u0026nbspMagellanic\u0026nbspCloud, using\u0026nbspa new method that allowed them to capture the stars quickly. The stars they observed are called\u0026nbspCepheid variables, and change brightness predictably, allowing them to be used to measure intergalactic distances.The new method allowed the researchers to measure many more of those stars far more quickly. Normally, Hubble can only look at one star each time it takes one of its 90-minute orbits around Earth, but the new method allowed it to see dozens in that same time.Using that data, the researchers were able to confirm our understanding of the “cosmic distance ladder”, which allows us to determine distances throughout the universe. And they were able to use the information to calculate the Hubble constant, and see how fast the cosmos is expanding.The more precise that understanding became, the clearer it was that the speed was not in line with what they expected. Scientists have made predictions of the Hubble constant based on data from the\u0026nbspEuropean Space Agency’s Planck satellite, which can\u0026nbspobserve\u0026nbspthe conditions of the early universe just 380,000 years after it came into existence.The two numbers did not match up. That led scientists to think that there must be something missing in their understanding of how the beginning and current universe match up.“This is not just two experiments disagreeing,” Riess explained. “We are measuring something fundamentally different. One is a measurement of how fast the universe is expanding today, as we see it. The other is a prediction based on the physics of the early universe and on measurements of how fast it ought to be expanding.“If these values don’t agree, there becomes a very strong likelihood that we’re missing something in the cosmological model that connects the two eras.”Professor Riess and his team are not able to say why such a difference exists. They hope to work to refine it even more, allowing them to get rid of any further uncertainty about the Hubble constant.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s an outrage,” said Alan Beattie, a Brussels based writer said.Why Belgium is great for a getawayBelgian racing pigeon sells for record-breaking £1.07m“It is an institution,” said petitioner Miryam Hernandez Irigoyen. “My German mother in law who speaks not a word of French got lost at Midi – how did we find her? Thanks to Sam! Everyone knows to meet at the zebra horse.”The statue, which would have knowingly watched over Britain’s team of Brexit negotiators as they arrived for talks, was at one point considered for relocation as a possible museum exhibit. The Brussels Museums Council described the work as “a landmark, a national treasure” that was “just like the Atomium and Manneken-Pis”.All was thought lost after one journalist reported on Thursday afternoon that the statue was missing from its place and had been “removed some time in the last 24 hours”.\u0026nbspBut The Independent can reveal that Pret A Manger has had a last-minute\u0026nbspchange of heart,\u0026nbspacquired the surreal statue, and will install it back in its original location outside their shop when it opens.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Palestinian beekeepers inspect beehives at the honey-bee farm in the east of Khan Younis town, near the border with Israel, southern Gaza Strip.

This was not a poll of wider Tory voters but of people who pay an annual subscription to the party.If this group of around , people are not prepared to vote for their own party, then what chance have the Tories in attracting votes from the wider electorate But it gets worse — even elected Tory representatives are planning to rat on their party in the European elections.A Survation poll suggests that four in ten Conservative councillors are planning to back the Brexit Party too.Loyalty, it used to be said, was the Tories’ secret weapon.Not any more.The party has become like an army whose frontline troops have started burrowing beneath enemy lines — not in order to plant explosives beneath its positions, but in the hope of joining it in its trenches.No Conservative leader will find it easy to turn around the situation, but at least a new face, with some new ideas and a fresh perspective on how to solve the Brexit impasse, would have a chance.Anything would be better than being led round and round in circles by a Prime Minister who has become tired and stuck.Every time May comes to the despatch box after some new, devastating vote in the Commons, I find myself thinking: Surely she must have a fresh strategy now.Then I find myself groaning to learn that no, still she seems to think that the answer is to keep on plugging her failed deal.To huge numbers of British people, May has become a large part of the problem.What was once seen as her greatest asset — resilience — is now seen as plain stubbornness.It has become impossible to imagine any satisfactory outcome to Brexit until she is gone.Sadly, I fear that May herself cannot see this.Like John Major in the last, wretched years of his premiership, I fear she has convinced herself that she is an asset to her party and her country when almost everyone  can see that the opposite is true.As with Major in the mid s, every day that May remains in Downing Street is adding to the scale of defeat the party faces at the ballot box.The only dference is that then the beneficiary was the moderate Tony Blair.This time around, an unpopular but stubborn Tory leader is adding rocket fuel to the chances of an unreformed Marxist, Jeremy Corbyn, becoming Prime Minister.I know May is desperate to achieve some sort of legacy before she leaves Downing Street, butshe resists much longer her main achievement will be an indirect one — it will be to let in a Labour government which s Britain to the sort of punitive tax rates which drove a brain drain of iniduals and businesses from the country in the s.It is a great shame that May did not resign last December, when  of her MPs voted against her in a confidence vote.Her margin of victory — she won  per cent of votes — would have constituted a substantial mandate in an open leadership contest.But this was not a leadership contest.It was a no-confidence vote in a sitting Prime Minister, in which anything less than a resounding victory would have been unsatisfactory.Given that more than  Conservative MPs are members of the Government — and were therefore duty bound to support their Prime Minister in a confidence vote — May failed even to carry with her a majority of her backbenchers.And that was before the multiple Commons defeats for her deal, which have led to open rebellion in the Cabinet.Were such a vote to be held now, it is inevitable that many ministers who reluctantly backed her in December would no longer feel they needed to do so.Under the Conservative Party’s rules, May cannot be challenged again in a no-confidence vote for a full  months after the last one. But there are rumblings to change this rule.Graham Brady, Chairman of the  Committee, which represents backbenchers, is reported to be planning to visit May next week to tell her to resign before the end of June.But that won’t be soon enough. Before then, the Tories face twin wipeouts in the local and European elections. The latter may be utterly pointless but nevertheless, a derisory performance is still going to be deeply traumatic when it happens.Theresa May’s ministers have dutully supported her in the past.Her duty is now to step aside immediately, before she accidentally ends up leading her party to an even greater humiliation in a general election than the one it suffered in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why kill the innocents ”An obvious question from all right-minded people. But when you’re a murdering psycho, you want to wreak terror not just on those present, but in the minds of millions around the world.And the way they do that is to target innocent people in the normal, everyday scenarios we can all identy with.Attending a church or mosque with family and friends, taking our kids to a concert or a busy shopping mall at the weekend, cheering on marathon runners, queuing for breakfast at a holiday hotel . . .Who among us has not read about Sneha and her friends . . .  or the heartbreaking stories of the British father who lost his we and two children . . . or the Danish man who lost three of his four children . . . and thought of how we would copefaced with the same situation That’s terrorism. It projects fear on to the masses and seeks to make us alter our behaviour accordingly.With every fibre of my being, I want to resist the power of this pernicious tactic, but of late I’ll admit I have struggled.On Friday night, our -year-old attended a Shawn Mendes concert at London’s O arena with a friend and her mother. We wrestled with whether to let her go or not, then felt anxious from the moment she set off until she ed home.Equally, when she expressed a wish to meet her friends at a vast mall last week, we urged her to give it a miss and browse the shops locally. Irrational, yes, but that’s what terrorism can do to your mindsetyou let it.You don’t want to be that grieving family, so you try to minimise the chances of it happening.The truth, of course, is thata suicide bomber decides to board your train carriage, or walk in to your community centre, or drive a car that blows up just as you’re walking past — there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.But what we can do is stand together in our firm belief that these attacks — be it on churches or mosques — have nothing to do with religion.Just hours after the coordinated bombings in his country, the Sri Lankan minister of state for defence said preliminary investigations have shown, “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch [New Zealand]”.Meanwhile, reports have emerged of young Christian men walking the streets near Sneha’s home of Negombo carrying long sticks and “looking for Muslims”.Again, this us-against-them mindset is what terrorism seeks to inflame.But this isn’t about Christianity versus Islam.The attacks in Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Manchester and London — to name but a few — are the actions of a warped few who have distorted the teachings of wholly peaceful religions to suit their own, murderous ends.We mustn’t allow one drop of poison to contaminate an ocean of humanity.DR GAIL BRADBROOK is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the eco action group that brought central London to a virtual standstill last week.She says: “I think our protests have been awesome.“We’re making history at the minute, people are having a fantastic time on the streets and we really welcome people to come join us.”Yes, I’m sure workers on zero hours contracts would relish the opportunity to lose a day’s payto join her, so too the nurses whose arrival at nearby St Thomas’ hospital each day is critical to the wellbeing of thousands of patients.Dr Bradbrook may have a PhD in molecular biophysics but one fears she and her merry band of protestors may have skipped lessons in common sense.Why  would they glue themselves to public transport that encourages people to leave their cars at home while simultaneously causing air polluting traffic jams And why  would they stage a sit-in aimed to make the politicians take notice when the House of Commons rose on April  for recess and didn’tuntil yesterday  Duh.The majority of the population supports action on climate change, but this virtue-signalling nonsense only detracts from the cause by irritating ordinary people just tryingto earn a living. Begging the question: Why only now HOLLYWOOD star Anne Hathaway says she’s giving up alcohol until her son is .She’s a stronger woman than me.Meanwhile, she has also abandoned veganism after admitting that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy”. She says she immediately felt betterafter eating a fish dish from Iceland.I know what you’re thinking . . . was it the £ prawn ring as advertised by Kerry Katona No, Anne’s le-changing fish experience was a sustainably sourced salmon at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Reykjavik.Easy mistake to make though.“HEALTH tourism” is still an ongoing issue, with reports that ten people a day are jetting to the UK to have their babies delivered on the NHS.The bill for caring for , foreign maternity cases was around £.million in  , with only £.million of it clawed back.Meanwhile, three-year-old Victoria Komada, from Norwich, was born with twisted legs and faced a double amputation.And thanks only to the generosity of the local community in Norwich and those in Poland’s Szczecin, where her parents grew up, £, was raised for her to fly toFlorida for an operation to help her walk. Each week we see the plight of desperate people trying to raise money for treatments the NHS won’t fund.Just think of how many of them that unrecouped £.million might have helped.Some days, it feels like we in the UK have  of them.CERTAIN IVF clinics are exploiting older women whose chances of having a baby are very poor, the fertility regulator has warned.Since , the number of -plus women having IVF has doubled, with some clinics “trading on hope” despite a success rate of just one per cent for a woman of  using her own eggs.A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid she would like these clinics to be honest about the low statistics.She’s right, but one suspects the number of older women opting for IVF will remain high.Because when you’re desperate for a child, even in a fertility lottery of just one per cent, there still lies the hope that it could be you.Fast forward years and they’re still performing though, despite a healthy diet and regular exercise, the batteries are running noticeably lower. Particularly as there’s now only three of them on stage.Howard,  this weekend, is a former breakdancer and perhaps the fittest of them all.But while his body is making all the right moves, his face is positively screaming: “Is there much more of this  Line Of Duty’s on in a minute.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have assembled a erse group of candidates from across the political spectrum, from former Tory Ann Widdecombe to left-wing grandee Claire Fox.We are all unied in our desire to pressure Westminster to deliver what the people instructed.It is vital we restore parliamentary democracy. Through my service with the Royal Marines and the Special Boat Service, I witnessed the Arab Spring first-hand and saw the horrors suffered by a people with no representation in their political system.I never thought our political class would deliberately undermine the people.But they have done so by failing to deliver on the  referendum. This after the  General Election manestos of the Conservative and Labour parties clearly pledged to honour the result.Voters on all sides have been betrayed. The final straw for me was seeing the men who sent me to a questionable war in Afghanistan — Tony Blair, Lord Adonis and Alastair Campbell — conspiring to undermine the people.They have been colluding with other governments in Europe to stop Brexit.It is vital we stand up against the damage this hardcore group who want to create an EU super-state are inflicting on British democracy.It is deeply saddening to see the isions across our country. People voted to Remain and Leave for a range of legitimate reasons.We are in this position due to John Major and Tony Blair’s arrogance in not consulting thepeople on the treaties that embedded us in the EU — Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon.The public should have been consulted on these major transfers of power from Parliament towards the supranational structures of the EU.We are now left with this political mess as their legacy.One of the greatest testaments to Britain is that so many people are willing to take huge risks to come and live here, to be free and prosperous.My ancestors came to the UK from Ireland in the th century to escape famine and persecution. They settled in Greenock in the Scottish Lowlands.I am deeply disturbed that Brexit has now come to focus on identity and immigration, instead of on democracy and who runs our country.We should celebrate immigrants as the heroes who want to be British and part of the national ­success story. Brexit is not a right-wing project. Five million Labour voters and a third of ethnic-minority voters backed Leave.Yet from some of the rhetoric spouted, you would think that Brexit voters are all ignorant racists.  The result is that the Leave voters feel patronised, insulted and ignored. Look at the  Labour MPs — many of whom represent Leave-voting constituencies — who voted for a second referendum to overturn the first.The contempt they show for the ordinary people who put their faith in the democratic process is breathtaking.If politicians fail to deliver the result of the referendum, they will be guilty of selling out the people and undermining Britain’s international credibility as a stable and free liberal democracy.The backlash from the public would be unthinkable.Beyond Brexit, I see an opportunity to implement the strongest animal welfare and environmental legislation in the world. It is a chance to reset our relationship with nature, away from the Common Agricultural Policy.I strongly disagree with those who want to weaken environmental policy.Yet the beauty of an accountable liberal democracy is that those decisions can be made in our own Parliament.A vote for the Brexit Party will send shockwaves across Westminster, reminding them that the people are in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meanwhile, Meghan is on maternity leave, believed to be just days away from giving birth.The Duke of Sussex appeared in good spirits as he headed inside the abbey for todays service, laughing and smiling with his sister-in-law.But his attendance at this afternoons service is so much of a surprise due to his babys impending birth that his name had not been printed in the programme.A source told The Daily Mail: He is pleased he can attend today’s Service, as planned.With their baby due, his name was not printed in the programme in case he was unable to do so.But Former Sun Royal Editor, Duncan Larcombe pointed out the future dad would be able to get to Windsor extremely quicklyhe needed.He told The Sun Online: She is due any minute now, so Harry could get to Windsor pretty quickly under a police escortthe news came through.Harry - who sported his medals including the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal - looked pensive during the service as he sat next to Prince Richard and one seat from Kate Middleton.During the service, the Dean of Westminster prayed for an end to terror and for the triumph of peace as he remembered the New Zealand mosques terrorist attack on Anzac Day.In his bidding the Dean said: We honour today the bravery and determination of the men at Gallipoli.The spirit of national pride encourages us, as we bring to mind in particular the recent terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand.We pray for an end to terror and for the triumph of peace.Meanwhile, the Queen led mourners at the funeral of her friend Jeanie, Countess of Carnarvon, following her death aged .The service was held at Highclere Castle in Newbury, used as the main filming location for Downton Abbey.She told Fabulous Digital: Since Kate first married William she has always shown very strong bonds of fun and good humour with her brother-in-law Harry and its clear from their surprise appearance together today that rapport is still firmly in place.Harry’s le roles might have changed, along with his responsibilities as a husband and father-to-be, but its obvious from his body language here that the more childlike sense of fun is still in place.On Sunday, the body language expert claimed Prince Harry was desperate to avoid his brother at the Easter church service.However, Judi said the Duke of Sussex looked more at ease in just Kates presence today.She explained: Harry has looked awkward around his older brother recently but here his stride looks positive to the point of jaunty and the mirroring between Harry and Kate suggests they still share the same sense of humour.Kate’s laugh is wide and congruent as she arrives but as she and Harry walk together using eye contact their more suppressed smiling and eye shapes hint that they’re both laughing at the same thing.Harry still retains the partial barrier he’s used recently, with the one hand clipping his jacket together and this hints at some anxiety for his pregnant we back at home but his sense of energy and his rounded-cheek smile suggests he is otherwise relaxed and upbeat in Kate’s company here.Speculation that the brothers have been feuding have been building over the past few months since Harry married former American actress Meghan in May last year.Only this week, body language experts claimed Harry was desperate to avoid his brother at the Easter church service over the weekend.The brothers - who normally walk in side-by-side on such occasions - set tongues wagging by arriving separately and not speaking.But the arrival of Baby Sussex could help to heal the feud between the couples, royal experts have said.The world has been waiting with bated breath this week for news that Prince Harry and Meghan have become parents.It is believed the Duchess of Sussex is considering a home birth at Windsor - possibly at Frogmore Cottage.Clues that the former American actress is close to giving birth have been coming thick and fast, including her mum Doria Ragland arriving in the UK last week.And fans are counting down the days after the new royal revealed she was six months pregnant as she met locals during her and Prince Harrys first joint engagement of  on January .She was last seen in public last month when she joined Prince Harry to pay tribute to the New Zealand mosque attack victims.Now, she is reportedly nesting in her new home, surrounded by scented candles as she awaits the birth.While royal fans are on edge for the news, Buckingham Palace announced that Meghan and Harry will keep the birth of their first-born private until they have had an opportunity to celebrate as a family.And with Harry leaving heavily pregnant we the Duchess of Sussex behind at home to carry out the official royal engagement today, bookmakers are now predicting May, rather than April, will be the royal babys birth month.William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said: We were as surprised as everyone  that Harry decided to attend a public event as we assumed the baby was imminent.

I just went to work that morning, I didnt go to hurt anyone.I came across that situation and moved forward when I shouldnt have done.Asked by Stuart Ellacott, prosecuting, about his hand gestures and clapping, Phoenix added: I was frustrated.I thought we are now all in this jam and no one can move. I was thinkingone of you had just let me through it would have cleared it up.The jury was told Graham Booker, , had illegally parked his car in the zig-zag area of the crossing, causing the traffic to build up.Mr Ellacott said Booker had been convicted of careless driving for his actions that contributed to the tragic incident.He also told jurors Phoenix should still have been able to see the lights change and stop at the crossing.Mr Ellacott said the defendant had failed to look in the mirror at the front of his cab that would have shown Jaiden crossing.Inspector Joe Pardey, of Dorset Police, said: Its a tragic case and it shows the importance for drivers to be fully aware of their surroundings, no matter what they are confronted with.Mr Phoenix placed his vehicle on a pedestrian crossing, not being able to see the lights and not being able to observe the potential hazards that faced him.The lack of a few checks that would have been obvious to a competent and careful driver led to the death of Jaiden.Mr Phoenix has admitted some responsibility in the death of Jaiden and no sentence is ever going to replace his le.Id like to praise the initial members of the public and emergency services who attended and made the very best efforts they could to save Jaidens le.Our thoughts are with the family and I hope this will bring them one step of closure in this tragic incident."},{"url":null,"title":"creep hides ex house toilet seat up","story":"Cary Cocuzzi reportedly hid inside the -year-old’s home despite being banned from contacting her because of his past behaviour.She first became suspicious she wasnt alone when she found a blanket secreted in the corner of her cellar.The woman then noticed the toilet seat had been left up at the home she only shared with her two daughters.“I had an intuition about it but I ignored it, I brushed it aside,” she told WPXI TV station.“I just thought: ‘Gosh, is this guy in my house  I didn’t want to seem paranoid but I should have trusted my instincts because I was right.”The woman finally found her ex after hearing noises upstairs which at first she thought must be her cat.However, when she went to investigate she found Cocuzzi standing in her bedroom and called for help, according to the authorities.When Pittsburgh police arrived they found Cocuzzi hiding under a pile of clothing.Its reported he told officers he had been sleeping in the attic and cellar because he “was tired of being homeless and wanted a place to stay.”Cocuzzi has been charged with burglary and unlawful restraint and is being held in Allegheny County Jail until his next court appearance.His ex-girlfriend said she was thankful that her two daughters were not at home at the time she came across him.“I feel like this is going to affect me for the rest of my le,” she added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The sickening image is just one of many revealed by animal welfare campaigners in a dog and cat meat market in Indonesia. It has prompted campaigners including actors Peter Egan and Ricky Gervais to urge the Indonesian government to stick to promises to ban the harrowing trade. “The facts are just horrible,” said Downtown Abbey star Peter.  “The dogs and cats caught up in these egregious trades are my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night. “Dogs serve mankind loyally and deserve to be treated with compassion and respect.”  The coalition of welfare groups Dog Meat Free Indonesia recently published nightmare footage filmed at a market on the island of Sulawesi. Now the campaigners have revealed equally dreadful atrocities taking place in filthy make-sht slaughterhouses in Surakarta, also known as Solo, the capital of the island of Java. This is despite the Ministry of Agriculture having issued a directive in September that won global applause for calling on provincial governments to tackle the dog and cat meat trades.  Ricky Gervais said: “The dog and cat meat trades are cruel and dangerous, and the time is now for action to be taken to banish these horrors to the history books of shame and illegality. “The world is watching and waiting for action, today.” This latest investigation by Dog Meat Free Indonesia reveals that an estimated , dogs of unknown disease and vaccination status continue to be captured and stolen each month throughout Java – home to over half of Indonesia’s nearly  million people. “It is devastatingly sad to think of the thousands of dogs and cats who are losing their lives in the most terrying ways every day,” said Sophia Latjuba, actress and Dog Meat Free Indonesia ambassador. “As a nation who values compassion, humanity and respect for all, we must extend these principles to animals, who are often the most vulnerable members of our society. If we truly value peace and kindness for all, we must align our actions with our words and call for a dog meat-free Indonesia.”  It is estimated that just % of Indonesia’s population eats dog meat, but they do so a great risk to themselves in a country where rabies is re. “It is time to finally wake up to the true cost of the dog meat trade,” said Jill Robinson MBE, Animals Asia founder. “It is a public health emergency directly responsible for thousands of deaths every year due to the spread of rabies. “No meal is worth so many innocent lives.”   Dr Katherine Polak of FOUR PAWS warned: “We know that rabies control and elimination efforts are futile without addressing the dog meat trade which is the only trade known to encourage the mass unregulated movement of dogs of unknown disease and vaccination status, facilitating the spread of the disease and disrupting any attempts to reach the required canine vaccination coverage required to ultimately eliminate the disease from the dog population.” Karin Franken of the Jakarta Animal Aid Network said the Indonesian governmentaposs pledges need to be followed by effective actions: “For now, the illegal trades continue, threatening the health and safety of millions of Indonesians, and resulting in the suffering of thousands of animals each day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fair pay campaigners reveal britains","story":"NewsFair pay campaigners reveal Britains first Living Wage buildingSupporters of the voluntary rate welcomed the move by Lambeth Council, which owns the South London tower blockShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  APR News\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn -storey tower block is today revealed as Britain’s first “Living Wage building”. All firms based at International House have agreed to pay workers and contractors at least £. an hour - £. more than the Government’s legal minimum. The move is a boost for the Living Wage Foundation, the campaign which urges bosses to lt pay rates above the statutory floor. It hopes more leaseholders will declare their properties “Living Wage buildings”, expanding the rollout of higher pay.  The Government’s National Living Wage - in reality, a rebranded minimum - is £. for workers aged  and over, falling to £. for employees aged  to  £. for those aged  to  and just £. for those under-. In contrast, the real Living Wage is £ an hour, rising to £. in London where costs are higher, with no age restrictions. International House in Brixton, South London, is owned by Lambeth Council and run by Space. The former council office reopened in  and will provide  jobs when fully occupied. Director Katherine Chapman said: “We’re delighted to see International House become the country’s first Living Wage building.  “Lambeth Council has shown real leadership in asking businesses based within its buildings to pay the London Living Wage. “We know the huge impact that supportive local authorities like Lambeth can have in driving Living Wage take-up. “Across the UK many councils are now not only accrediting as Living Wage employers but also using their convening power to help spread Living Wage accreditation through local businesses and supply chains.” Analysts calculate the voluntary rate taking into account costs like housing, travel and healthy food, and extras like kids’ birthday presents.

It’s there in the window.” DSS comes from the old name for the Department for Work and Pensions – the Department for Social Security – and is shorthand for ‘people on benefits’. As someone with severe mental health problems, Philippa was receiving disability benefits and disqualied from property after ­property. “As soon as I mentioned housing benefit to the letting agents, they would hang up on us,” she says. “I cry myself to sleep thinkinganything happens to my current place no one  is going to take me. I’ll be homeless.” Philippa was among witnesses ­challenging ‘no DSS’ tenancies at the Work and Pensions Select Committee in Parliament on Wednesday. Shelter says it is a breach of equality law that frequently leaves the housing charity “picking up the pieces”. Around . million adults rely on housing benefit to help with expensive private rents. Given that a recent Government survey showed that over halfof landlords are not willing to let to people receiving Housing Benefit or Local Housing Allowance, around three-quarters of a million people could be affected. Tory Housing Minister Heather Wheeler has pledged to crack down on the practice.But many people we spoke to believe ‘No DSS’ discrimination has become even worse since Universal Credit – as landlords fear people waiting weeks for support won’t be able to pay their rent.   In Belfast, landlord Helena McAleer told us she had found herself on the other side of the fence. She was actually refused a new mortgage on her buy-to-let property unless she evicted her ‘DSS’ tenant. The mortgage lenders said I had to seek an ‘alternative tenant’,” she says. “This actually meant evict your tenant.” Helena’s renter, who is a vulnerable woman, had always paid her rent on time and kept the house in good order with the help of her brother who lived a few doors down. Helena decided to take a stand. “I basically left NatWest because what they were doing was unacceptable,” she says. “It was so cold. I didn’t know such policies existed. I was in actual shock. Banks and companies hide behind closed doors, but these are people’s lives. They are forcing the likes of me to treat people in this way.” Speaking at the parliamentary hearing, Lloyd Cochrane, director of mortgages at NatWest, apologised to Helena. “Our approach was not consistent with our values to seek her to evict her tenant from the property,” he said. “We have made moves to try and make good on that. It was never our policy to evict tenants from the property, it was a mistake and we have coached the members of the team who were involved.”  He said NatWest now allows all landlords with buy-to-let mortgages to rent homes to benefit claimants. We also spoke to Rosie Keogh, a self-employed cleaner from Birmingham who brought a legal case against a lettings agent who discriminated against her. “As soon as I told them about being on benefits, they ended my application there and then,” she says. “I was refused point blank. It made me feel like a second-class citizen.” Her case was eventually settled out of court. Lynne Mapp was another who spoke at the hearing, on behalf of her daughter. “My daughter is a full-time carer for my -year-old mother, so she is on housing benefit,” she said. “I have been going to letting agents for the last two years trying to obtain housing for my daughter. “As soon as they hear the word housing benefit, they are not interested.” Helen Buck, executive director at Your Move, claimed her company had banned ‘no DSS’ adverts.But the committee of MPs confronted her with Your Move adverts with ‘no DSS’ found by a Google search done by Shelter. One advert even said benefit claimants were not welcome but “small dogs” would be considered. “I will need to go back, and I will need to make sure those adverts are not appearing,” Ms Buck told the committee. “We certainly have a policy of not having ‘No DSS’ adverts.” Greg Beales, director of campaigns at Shelter, said ‘no DSS’ discrimination is “morally bankrupt, potentially illegal and a source of deep distress to people all over the country – which leaves us struggling to understand why anyone would feel justied in defending them”. He added: “Public and political interest is growing since we’ve shone a spotlight on those discriminating against housing benefit. This is an important moment in the fight for fairness and shows the tide is changing.” Recently, in a major victory for campaigners, housing advert site Zoopla changed its policy to ban ‘no DSS’ listings. As Helena says: “Lenders are now starting to change their policies, but we need to see a change in the law.” "},{"url":null,"title":"health secretary wont rule out","story":"NewsPupils without MMR jab could be BANNED from school to combat \"anti-vax\" movementMatt Hancock says he doesnt think \"were there yet\", but wouldnt rule it out as an option in the future.ShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPupils could be banned from schooltheir parents refuse to give them the measles jab, the health secretary has warned.

False stories suggesting vaccination causes harms have become common on the internet. This growing “anti-vax” movement is thought to be to blame for parents not giving their children the jab. Mr Hancock pointed the finger at social media giants such as Facebook and YouTube, telling the BBC Radio  today programme: “I’m not relaxed about this at all. “One of the things I am particularly worried about is the spread of anti-vaccination messages online. “Vaccination is safe, it’s very, very important for the public health – for everybody’s health – and we’re going to tackle it.”    He was asked on Talk Radiochildren should be banned from school unless they are vaccinated. Host Julia Hartley-Brewer askedhe’d consider meeting the Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, to discuss “following in the footsteps” of France and the US. He replied: “I wouldn’t rule out anything but I don’t think we’re there yet. “In America they tried to do this and the courts stopped them so it can be complicated, but really it’s people’s responsibility as a parent to do the right thing - the right thing for their own children as well as, of course, the right of the community that everybody lives in.” Mr Hancock revealed he will meet social media firms on Monday to demand they “do more to take down lies” promoted on their sites. He said: “I have called in the social media companies, like we had to with self-harming images a few months ago. “I’m seeing them on Monday to require that they do more to take down lies that are promoted on social media about the impact of vaccination.”    Children should have two doses of the jab to be protected, with the World Health Organisation setting a target of % coverage. Unicef estimate  million children worldwide missed the first dose of the measles jab between  and , with , in the UK. Uptake of both jabs by the age of five has fallen in England for four years in a row, from .% in - to .% in -. There were  measles cases in England in , rising to  in . Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs, eyes and brain. In one in , cases, brain complications can be fatal. Babies and children with weakened immune systems are most at risk of complications. More common ones include diarrhoea and vomiting, lung infections and fits caused by a fever. In many countries including the UK, the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella - or German measles. The second dose is given to children before starting school, when three to four years old When the Prime Minister Theresa May’s official spokesman was asked whether children who have not been vaccinated for measles should be excluded from schools, she said: “I haven’t seen anyone suggesting that. “The overall risk of measles to the UK population is very low. The World Health Organisation said the UK achieved measles elimination status as recently as . “Overall vaccine uptake is also very high, at over %, but we are continuously working to drive up immunisation rates. “We are reviewing the slight decline in uptake as part of the long-term plan for the NHS to push coverage even higher and Public Health England are developing new campaigns about the benefits of immunisation.” A Government spokesperson said: “We ask schools to check what immunisations a child has had when they join a school but our guidance clearly states that schools cannot refuse admission or exclude a pupil because they have not been immunised. “Overall uptake of childhood vaccinations is over %.While not compulsory, it is important everyone takes up the vaccinations they are entitled to, so we are focused on ensuring parents and children know the facts about their benefits and on working with social media companies to stop the spread of misinformation around vaccinations.We are also reviewing how to improve vaccine uptake overall as part of our Long Term Plan for the NHS.” "},{"url":null,"title":"best worst areas uk social","story":"NewsBest and worst areas of UK to get social care for elderly relativesBritain is filled with blackspots where there arent enough carers to fill the roles needed to look after the elderly communityShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science Correspondent:,  APR NewsToughest places to get social care for elderly relatives revealed \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBlackspots where it is hardest to get social care for an elderly relative to remain at home have been revealed.

The brutal slaughter of three young children in their own house by a man they should have been able to trust. David McGreavy slaughtered eight month old baby Samantha, Dawn, two, and David, four, at their home in Worcester in .When their father, Clive Ralph, left them in the care of the man who he had welcomed into the family home as a lodger, the three were sleeping peacefully in bed. McGreavy was known for his affection for children, especially those he shared a home with, so the decision to leave him in charge of them was a simple one.    But when Clive ed from collecting their mother, Elsie, from work the house was a blood bath and his children had been murdered by the man who was supposed to be protected them. There was no sign of McGreavy or the children. Aged just , McGreavy had flown into a drunken rage because baby Samantha started crying for her bottle. He strangled her with his hands and she eventually died from a fracture to her skull. McGreavy then turned his murderous intention to the other youngsters. He slit two-year-old Dawnaposs throat and strangled Paul, four, with a wire.  After the violent murders he then mutilated their tiny bodies with a pickaxe and impaled them on a neighbouraposs fence. It earned him the chilling nickname the aposMonster of Worcesterapos and McGreavy was jailed for  years for the brutal crime. Aged just  at the time of the killings, no one could have predicted the terrying events of that night. The childrensapos mother even claimed McGreavy was like a father to the trio and he had been known to criticise her when she disciplined Paul. McGreavy had moved into the family home when Elsie was pregnant with her youngest daughter. He immediately became a much-loved part of the family, often cooking Sunday dinner and babysitting for the three children.  His crime stunned the nation - how could a man who adored the children he was living with subject them to such horror  McGreavyaposs family were also baffled. His father, Tom McGreavy, said: Everyone who knew David knew that he loved children. But the affable young man who had become a key part of family le for the Ralphaposs was hiding a dark past. Born in Southport in , he was the second oldest of six children and spent much of his childhood moving between army bases as his father was a sergeant in the army. His early le pushed him to pursue a career in the Armed Forces and by  he had quit school and enlisted in the Navy.  In the late sixties, and stationed in Portsmouth, McGreavy joined his first ship, HMS Eagle. Described by colleagues as a arrogant young man and cocky McGreavy found himself subject to several disciplinary procedures. But then he started drinking and his career began to unravel. While working as a steward in the mess hall he spotted his name had been written in a Chief Petty Officeraposs Book. Worried this could mean he was about to be told he was changing jobs he reached for booze. Criminologist Dr Elizabeth Yardley said: He actually broke into an officeraposs ward room and set fire to a bin that had papers in it.  He said he did this mistakenly, by accidentally dropping a cigarette end, and he did raise the alarm at :am. He expected the Navy to believe he was just an innocent eye witness, they saw beyond that and he was court marshalled. He was found guilty of negligence and sentenced to  days detention. By  he had fallen in love with a woman called Mary, who he proposed to just one week after meeting her for the first time. In the same year his career in the Navy had collapsed and he was dismisssed and he was forced tohome to his parents. A series of jobs followed, from chef to labourer, but they all eneded the same way - he was sacked.  His attitude, arrogance and alcohol were all cited as reasons. McGreavy now put all his focus on his upcoming marriage to Mary - and he wanted a huge white wedding with all the trimmings. But on New Yearaposs Eve  Mary ended the engagement, leaving McGreavy devasated. Depressed and sulking while living with his parents, McGreavy moved into with his school friend, Clive Ralph. Cliveaposs decision to allow him to lodge with his family would have devastating consequences. The father had married Elsie when she was just  and pregnant with their first child and worked hard as a lorry driver to provide for his growing family. Living conditions in the two-bed house were cramped.  McGreavy shared a bed with little Paul while baby Samantha was in a cradle cot in her parentsapos room and Dawn slept in a bed next to her mum and dad. Cliveaposs lorry driving job meant he was regularly away from home and Elsie was grateful for McGreavyaposs help in caring for the children and running the home. A genial man who was adored by the family and liked by those who knew him, once again his personality completely changed whe he drank. McGreavy was arrested several times for being drunk in public and his father warned him to stop. But his refusal to listen cost three young children their lives. On the night of the killings McGreavy had been drinking in a pub with a friend. He drank between five and seven pints and played cards and darts.  Clive picked him up so he could babysit the children while he went to collect Elsie from her own job in another pub. Nothing could have prepared the couple for the scene that greeted them when they ed home. The walls were drenched with blood and there was no sign of McGreavy or the children. Police found their bodies impaled on the fence an hour later. At the time the sight was so hideous that Detective Superintendent Bob Booth, head of West Mercia CID, said: No investigating officer has ever had to witness that such a scene of indescribable horror. When police arrested McGreavy he initially denied carrying out the gruesome murders. By the following afternoon, he snapped and confessed. During his police interview he slumped forward and started sobbing.  McGreavy said: It was all too bloody gruesome. It was me but it was not me, how could I do it  On Paul I used the wire. Everything just seem to cave in.  I picked up the pickaxe and used all of them then I went outside and put them on the railings. All I can hear is the kids, kids f****** kids. I did the same to Dawn and used the piece of curtain wire on Paul. Asked why he had killed the three innocent children, McGreavy replied: That is what I have been trying to figure out. He pleaded guilty to the murders in a hearing that lasted just eight minutes. Most of his sentence has been served with him under protection as he has been subject to abuse from other prisoners.  In , McGreavy was transferred to an open prison and now he has been cleared for release. The news has come as a devastating blow to their mother, now Elsie Urry after re-marrying. She is terried she will see him on the street. McGreavy would be subject to exclusion zones including where Mrs Urry lives - but they could still bump into one another where. The Parole Board said a victim was entitled to request for conditions to be added to a release licence.Mrs Urry  told the BBC  : I go to Basingstoke... with my brother, where they live, and things like that and it doesnapost... cover that does it She added: Thereaposs people in prison who have done murders, not half as bad as what heaposs done, and yet they havenapost been put up for parole, so why should he get it  "},{"url":null,"title":"former british army officer spent","story":"NewsFormer British Army officer spent thousands watching children being abused liveAndrew Whiddett, from Portsmouth, live-streamed sickening footage from the Philippines, Croydon Crown Court heardShareByTom Pilgrim:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsAndrew Whiddett admitted six charges relating to the sexual abuse of children \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn ex-British Army officer is facing jail after he spent thousands of pounds watching children being sexually abused live on the internet.Andrew Whiddett, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, also discussed flying out to the Philippines - where the sickening videos were filmed - to commit abuse himself, the National Crime Agencysaid. The -year-old ex-lieutenant colonel, who was awarded an MBE for service in Northern Ireland, pleaded guilty to six charges relating to the sexual abuse of children at Croydon Crown Court on Wednesday. The NCA said his crimes were committed in the UK after he left the Army and finished private contractor work as head of security at the British Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. Following his guilty pleas, the NCA said Whiddett had directed the live-streamed abuse over Skype with known Filipino child sex abuse facilitators. Whiddett had conversations with a woman between September and October , in which he made clear he wanted to sexually abuse a child when he visited the Philippines that October, the NCA said. Investigators were able to prove that he made  payments to the woman totalling £, between January  and July . On November , , Whiddett paid £. to watch a nine-year-old girl abused, the NCA said. Travel records show Whiddett flew to the Philippines capital Manila on October , , and other messages between Whiddett and abuse facilitators were also discovered by officers. The NCA said it had passed intelligence to Filipino counterparts who made one arrest and safeguarded six children aged between three and .  After Whiddett was arrested in October  at Heathrow Airport he admitted in interview to sending  payments to the Philippines but said these were for live adult sex shows. He declined to answer questions in another interview in March . In court on Wednesday he admitted one charge of attempting to cause or incite a girl under the age of  to engage in sexual activity in November .  Whiddett also pleaded guilty to a charge of intentionally causing or inciting a girl under  to engage in sexual activity in September . Under a further charge he admitted that in September  he intentionally arranged or facilitated the commission of a child sex offence. He will also be sentenced over guilty pleas to three charges of making indecent photographs of a child, involving a total of eight category C and three category B images. Following the guilty pleas Judge Nicholas Ainley warned Whiddett: You should prepare yourself for a period of imprisonment. Judge Ainley had issued a temporary order banning the publication of photos of the defendant because his lawyers claimed it would place him in particular peril. But legal representations from the press made in court on Thursday saw this restriction lted by the judge, who admitted the order was made in error. Whiddett, who has no previous convictions and is on bail, will be sentenced at Croydon Crown Court on May . NCA senior investigating officer Gary Fennelly said: Andrew Whiddett was directly responsible for the soul-destroying abuse of children thousands of miles away from him. He thought he could get away with abusing Filipino children from the comfort of his own home. Anyone like him should realise the NCA and UK police will never give up our pursuit of offenders who commit these horric crimes. The NCA does important work with international law enforcement partners in the Philippines to combat these sorts of crimes. An NSPCC spokesman said: Whiddettaposs actions have helped to fuel a sickening industry where children are horrically abused to order. The effects of sexual abuse can last a letime and we hope that the children involved are receiving support and safeguarding to get their lives back on track. The internet is used as a gateway to child abuse far too frequently. The NSPCC is campaigning for providers to take greater responsibility for whataposs shared on their s and cut off this vile material at source.

The east-west rail line through the city London was due to open in December , but was put back to the Autumn of this year. Now, Crossrail Ltd have revealed they plan on completing the central section of work by the end of . But, they also claimed this could be the mid-point of a six month window for completing the work - meaning the final opening date could be as late as March .    They claim the latest delay is due to the complexity of remaining work. The central section of the Elizabeth line will open between Paddington and Abbey Wood and link the West End, the City of London, Canary Wharf and southeast London with initially  trains per hour during the peak. It is expected that all stations on the route will open except for Bond Street. Once the central section opens, full services across the Elizabeth line from Reading and Heathrow in the west to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east, will then open. In October , the government handed over a £million bailout for the transport project before Transport for London admitted the costs and time of completion would increase.    Mark Wild, Chief Executive of Crossrail Ltd, said: “I share the frustration of Londoners that the huge benefits of the Elizabeth line are not yet with us. But this plan allows Crossrail Ltd and its contractors to put the project back on track to deliver the Elizabeth line. Crossrail is an immensely complex project and there will be challenges ahead particularly with the testing of the train and signalling systems but the Elizabeth Line is going to be incredible for London and really will be worth the wait. This new plan will get us there and allow this fantastic new railway to open around the end of next year.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: I was deeply angry and frustrated when we found out about the delay to Crossrail last year. The information we had been given by the former chair was clearly wrong.   We now have a new Crossrail leadership team who have worked hard over recent months to establish a realistic and deliverable schedule for the opening of the project, which TfL and the Department for Transport will now review. Crossrail is a hugely complex project. With strengthened governance and scrutiny in place, TfL and the Department for Transport, as joint sponsors, will continue to hold the new leadership to account to ensure it is doing everything it can to open Crossrail safely and as soon as possible. When complete, the Elizabeth Line will transform travel across London and the South East, with new state-of-the-art trains taking millions of people more quickly across London, supporting hundreds of thousands of new homes and jobs.

Dean Phoenix had been distracted at the time because he was apossarcastically clappingapos another motorist just as he drove off, a court heard. Dashcam from a taxi approaching the crossing caught him swearing and gesticulating towards the driver. The -year-old admitted he made a mistake by failing to see a red light at the crossing to allow three-year-old Jaiden Mangan and his family walk across. He pulled away without seeing them and collided with Jaiden, who suffered fatal chest and abdominal injuries. Phoenix admitted a charge of causing death by careless driving but denied a more serious allegation of causing death by dangerous driving. He was today found not guilty by a jury following a two day trial at Bournemouth Crown Court , Dorset.On hearing the verdict Jaidenaposs distraught parents, James Mangan and Yasmin Dougan, broke down in tears and stormed out of court.    Phoenix, from Chineham, Hants, will be sentenced tomorrow for the careless driving charge and was remanded into custody. Jaiden was knocked down on the pedestrian crossing in Wareham, Dorset, on March  last year - the day before his fourth birthday. The court heard Phoenix had become frustrated after an elderly motorist illegally parked his car on the zig zag lines on the crossing, blocking the lorryaposs path. Phoenix was then caught on a dashcam gesticulating at another driver on the opposite side of the road he mistakenly thought had stopped to let him through a very tight gap. In fact the car had stopped for the red light at the crossing.    Phoenix started to drive around the illegally parked Vauxhall Astra car which is when he hit Jaiden. Phoenix told the jury: I wasnapost expecting anyone to be on the crossing. I couldnapost see the traffic lights, I thought they were still green. I hadnapost seen anyone approach the lights or push the button. All my concentration was on looking ahead at the situation and moving forward so I could free up the traffic. It was an accident, I made a mistake, thataposs why I pleaded guilty to careless driving. I never wanted to be in that position. I just went to work that morning, I didnapost go to hurt anyone. I came across that situation and moved forward when I shouldnapost have done. Asked by Stuart Ellacott, prosecuting, about his hand gestures and clapping, Phoenix said: I was frustrated.  After todayaposs verdict Inspector Joe Pardey, of Dorset Police, said: Itaposs a tragic case and it shows the importance for drivers to be fully aware of their surroundings, no matter what they are confronted with. Mr Phoenix placed his vehicle on a pedestrian crossing, not being able to see the lights and not being able to observe the potential hazards that faced him. The lack of a few checks that would have been obvious to a competent and careful driver led to the death of Jaiden. Mr Phoenix has admitted some responsibility in the death of Jaiden and no sentence is ever going to replace his le. Iaposd like to praise the initial members of the public and emergency services who attended and made the very best efforts they could to save Jaidenaposs le. Our thoughts are with the family and I hope this will bring them one step of closure in this tragic incident. Last year Graham Booker, the Astra driver, admitted charges of driving without due care and attention and causing a vehicle to stop within the limits of a puffin crossing. The -year-old was fined £ and ordered to pay costs of £ and a £ victim surcharge. He was also disqualied from driving for three months.

Anditaposs a stubborn splinter, try it a few times. It saves so much time, Claire says. And well worth seeing the kids smile at the end of it rather than red faces and tears!

Mariam Nabatanzi had her record number of babies by the time she was just  and all with the same father. Now , Mariam has had three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins.Sadly, her husband walked out on her three years ago and she is now solely responsible for her huge family. Mariam, from Uganda, was married aged just  to her then -year-old husband.    Her first set of twins came along just a year later. Mariamaposs le has been marred by tragedy and she and all of her children are forced to live in four cramped homes built from cement bricks with a corrugated iron roof. They are surrounded by coffee fields. After her first sets of twins were born, Nabatanzi went to a doctor who told her she had unusually large oies. He advised her that birth control like pills might cause health problems, so the children kept coming.    Large families are common in Africa with women in Uganda giving birth to . children in average, one of the highest birth rates on the continent according to the World Bank. But even in Uganda Mariamaposs family is considered huge. By the time she was  Mariam had  children and, desperate, went back to see her doctor in a bid to stop her having any more Once again, she was advised to keep getting pregnant because he oy count was so high. Her last pregnancy, two and a half years ago, had complications.    She gave birth to her sixth set of twins, but sadly one of them died during the labour. Then her husband - often absent for long stretches - abandoned her. His name is now a family curse and Mariam swears whenever she refers to him. She said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money.  And with so many mouths to feed, Mariam will turn her hand to anything. She has worked as a hairdresser and an event decorator. Mariam collects and sells scrap metal, brews local gin and sells herbal medicine. Most of her wages are spent on food to feed her huge family, medical care, clothes and school fees to ensure her brood has the best start in le. On a grimy wall in one room of her home hang proud portraits of some of her children graduating from school, gold tinsel around their necks.  Her eldest child, Ivan Kibuka, had to drop out of school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her. Mariamaposs mother walked out on her, her father and her five siblings three days after she was born. After her father remarried, her stepmother poisoned the five older children with crushed glass mixed in their food. They all died.  Mariam says she only escaped because she was visiting a relative. She added: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant. I was told by relatives what had happened. This harrowing tragedy sparked her desire for a huge family, although she originally hoped for six children. Providing a home for  youngsters is a constant challenge.  Twelve of the children sleep on metal bunk beds with thin mattresses in one small room with grime-caked walls. In the other rooms, children pile onto shared mattresses while the others sleep on the dirt floor. Older children help look after the young ones and everyone helps with chores like cooking. A single day can require  kilograms of maize flour, Mariam says. Fish or meat are rare treats.

The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"strathlachlan cup attracts players from all over argyll","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe annual Strathlachlan Cup Open Pairs indoor bowling competition took place on Saturday February  at Strachur Memorial Hall.There was a good turnout of  pairs with members from Cairnbaan, Colintraive, Connel, Innellan, Inveraray, Kilmun as well as the host club  Strathlachlan.There were some close games in the qualying rounds and the lucky four pairs to reach the semi-finals were Tom Paton and Moira Robertson, Strathlachlan Myra Campbell and Duncan Lauder, Innellan Fulton Ronald, Connel, and Robert Scott, Cairnbaan, and John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs Senior, Strathlachlan.The finalists were Strathlachlan#s John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs v Fulton Ronald and Robert Scott, with the visiting team going into the last end one shot up.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round. Good luck. Good luck.A ticket for the Millbrae breakfast,coach travel and entrance to the match is £.Other options include £ for match ticket and coach travel and £ for the match ticket only.

But historic County Buildings is also a modern workplace housing  staff delivering services for more than , people in South Ayrshire. From the grandeur of Provost Helen Moonie’s luxurious sea-view office to the dingy corridors of the basement, the  landmark is full of character. Our Local Democracy Reporter went on a ‘behind the scenes’ tour guided by council depute chief executive Douglas Hutchison. Looking around County Buildings, it is clear to see that history speaks through the detailed decor oozing out of every cornice. Two sweeping staircases sparkle with stunning stained-glass windows which hark back to the time when the whole of Ayrshire was ided into burghs. Each burgh had a crest, which are intricately etched into the glass. They include Ayr, Irvine, Troon Prestwick, Darvel, Kilmarnock, Largs and Saltcoats among others.  Nowadays Ayrshire is ruled by three separate councils but the County Buildings design still echoes a past when Ayr reigned supreme. Its former position of housing the entire admininstrative work of the county is reflected in its extravagant architecture. The main council chambers where all major decisions take place have sleek slide-back oak  – which open into other rooms. The chambers could have one of the finest council views in the country overlooking the Firth of Clyde. Every committee room has an open fireplace, which would have warmed the wind-battered building before central heating. Another room has a glass display cabinet showing a town clerk wig and Royal Burgh of Ayr Truncheon among other artefacts. Councillors have their own swish ‘members library’ with newspapers, tea and coffee. The details of meetings taking place behind closed doors are still written in old-fashioned chalk on the front of blackboards. Showing us around, Mr Hutchison said: “This the front face of the council where the council business takes place.” The director of people also took us to a secret location – a secure vault – which opens into a large room for storingpostal votes.Now there is a mission to make the historic building more up to date to adhere with current workday practices. The original architecture is in conflict with the needs of a al workplace where open-plan is the norm. Attempts to fit more people into open- plan space means walls must come down but due to the listed status of the landmark all alterations must be carefully managed. There is also a need to make room for staff coming from the John Pollock centre and soon-to-be demolished Burns House. In contrast to the splendid offices and committee meeting rooms on the first floor, a newly renovated office for employee services staff features skylights and a purple meeting pod. Mr Hutchison said: “It is a lovely building. But trying to fit a modern working environment into an old building is not easy. There is a lot going on to make it more modern. We need to make more efficient use of space. The days of everybody turning up at their desks are gone. We have to work more flexibly.” Mr Hutchison showed us empty offices stripped bare, which are currently awaiting a facelt. Money to maintain the seat of power is ongoing with windows getting replaced along with other repairs. Mr Hutchison said: “There is a programme of general investment in the building.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsMuseumsKilmarnockIrvineCosmetic surgeryFirth of ClydeTroonDarvelPrestwickLargsSaltcoats"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mossblown teenage beauty queen bags","story":"NewsMossblown teenage beauty queen bags Miss Scotland final spotThe Mossblown beauty was up against thousands of other applicants and wowed a  of judges to make the final  girls.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  APR NewsCarly Rose Spence, from Mossblown, is a Miss Scotland finalist\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenage beauty queen is going for gold as she competes to become an ambassador for her country.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

consultation was being planned, despite the apparent lack of interest in any alterations.George Robertson, community councillor and chair of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership , noted that there was no funding available to make any of the proposals happen.He said: ldquoIt is a wishlist of things ndash it is not going to be happening any time soon.ldquoThat is the long and the short of it.ldquoIf you are interested in the future of the park obviously come along to the meeting and have your say but do not expect anything to happen any time soon.Included among the ideas is the possibility of creating a ldquopavilion with toilets in the style of the pagoda recently demolished, as well as a series of paths and information cairns.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the community

the public consultation which took place last year in the townrsquos Bleachingfield Centre.At that time, a display featuring a series of images and information boards highlighted potential changes to the park, including new seating and picnic benches, as well as a maze and parkour course.Long-term aspirations also included the suggestion of creating a replacement pavilion with access to public

enthusiasm for proposed changes, adding paths or parkour, or anything , said Mrs Swan.ldquoI was taken aback that East Lothian Council had seen fit to continue with a masterplan.Mrs Swan, who was

immediate priorities should be addressed first and scarce resources addressing immediate wishes of the community as expressed in the first instance.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said work to develop ldquoa programme of improvements for the park had been ongoing since .She said: ldquoFrom the outset it was made clear that financing any improvements would be challenging but that in itself was not justication for ignoring the need.ldquoThe benefit of having a masterplan in place means thatopportunity presented itself, either by way of outside funding or sources of materials, inidual

Ormiston Park where signicant improvements have been delivered.ldquoFollowing the most recent meeting to discuss the draft masterplan, the council was advised by the steering group that, although work

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

With the sciences it should be a no-no, but it does seem to be prevalent in quite a lot of the smaller subjects.\"It seems to be a growing problem.

But I suspect the party faithful will realise this announcement furthers their cause not a jot.Martin Redfern,Woodcroft Road, Edinburgh.THE political situation in the United Kingdom is a veritable Pandoras Box of misunderstandings, unravellings, hubris, nostalgia and gross incompetence.It truly takes a careful observer patience and acuity to work their way through the morass.Observers from outside the UK watch with disbelief as the Conservative Party tries to hold itself together against the assaults of its internal and external opponents.The disdain that has been shown by the Conservative leadership to the European negotiators is only equalled by that shown to the other nations of the UK.Now in Scotland, we find ourselves on the cusp of a new stage of political development which will go forward despite the opponents mantra of \"too wee, too small, too poor\".The previous three years have shown such levels of Government incompetence and inhumanity that there has been a clear sht in Scottish self-awareness. Despite the chorus of hostility against the Scottish Government by all the major parties who support the Union, it is being seen by many outside the UK that Westminster is a busted flush.The Conservative Partys policies of the two-child family, the bedroom tax, the hostile environment of the Home Office to the Windrush generation and other BAME families have exposed Westminster as deeply uncaring. The treatment of low-paid British workers and benefit recipients has been beyond belief for someone like me who was born at the end of the Second World War.Nicola Sturgeon has been promoted by many as a competent and humane leader. She has throughout the Brexit negotiationstried to find solutions that embraced the economic and social needs of the whole of the UK and of European citizens of the UK and UK residents in Europe.She is not without faults. Her support for the Growth Commission has caused many pro-independence supporters to feel disappointment. There are many of us who want to see the great opportunities that control of our own economy and currency can bring.The currency debateis a healthy one. It will determine the nature of the Scottish economy after independence.Let us ensure that we begin to build a country we can all be proud of.Maggie Chetty, Woodend Drive, Glasgow.JAMES Campbellcould not be more wrong. Far from having a banana republic currency, a Scots pound would be stronger than sterling. The top-secret McCrone Report of the mid-s said that Scotland would have one of the strongest currencies in the world. It would still be strong today because Scotland has a balance of trade surplus, while the UK runs a deficit of around pound billion a month. Sterling is the weak currency.As far as the EU being a ldquotiny market, it is more than eight times the UK market.

I hope Downing St wake up to that, insisted the Scot.He pointed out howa minister was found to have been responsible, they could face prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.ldquoItrsquos extraordinary to think a minister can leak details of the NSC and then think they can get away with it. Thatrsquos why a police inquiry now is so important, added Sir Michael.Downing St declined to comment on the leak but the Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman reflected her anger by saying: \"The Prime Minister is clear: the protection of information on matters of national security is of the highest importance.It was suggested a raft of senior ministers present at this weekrsquos NSC had raised security concerns about giving the G contract to Huawei, which operates under the governance of a Communist regime.Among these were Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, and Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary all said to harbour ambitions to succeed Mrs May when she leaves Downing St.One Whitehall insider claimed the leak was \"evidently briefed to make a leadership candidate look tough on China\".But, one by one, ministers came forward to decry the security breach and insist they were not to blame.Mr Hunt, speaking at a press gallery lunch at Westminster, described it as ldquoutterly appalling. When asked directlyhe or any of his staff had leaked the NSC information, the Foreign Secretary replied firmly: ldquoNo.Mr Javid said it was \"completely unacceptable\" for any Government minister to \"share sensitive information that cannot be out in the public domain\" andit happened, it should \"absolutely be looked at\".Mr Williamson made clear: ldquoNeither I nor any of my team have ulged information from the National Security Council.\"Such was the concern about the leak that Labour was successfully granted an Urgent Question in the Commons.Jo Platt, the Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, who called for a leak inquiry, saidit was found a minister had been responsible, then they were not fit to be in Cabinet or to become prime minister.\"Indeed,the leak was for an advantage in a Tory leadership race that would be truly shocking. Critical issues of national security should be handled with utmost care, not used as political ammunition in a Tory Party civil war, insisted the Greater Manchester MP.The SNPrsquos Martin Docherty-Hughes, who sits on the Commons Defence Committee, also denounced what he described as a ldquoshocking breach of protocol at the very highest levels.The West Dunbartonshire MP added: ldquoIt is unacceptable that the NSC has been shamefully turned into a tool for Tory leadership contenders.ldquoA full and thorough inquiry must get to the bottom of this, andneeded, a criminal inquiry, so those found to be responsible are properly held to account.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-huawei-leak-was-stupid-irresponsible-and-has-benefited-no-one","story":"But there are leaks and there are leaks and the latest one from the ldquoholy of holies, the National Security Council, has sent shockwaves across Whitehall and Westminster.We have, of course, become accustomed to ministers in Cabinet briefing about the latest twists and turns of the Brexit psychodrama there have even been occasions when a titbit emerges even before Theresa May has wrapped up a meeting.But now it seems someone, somewhere has become so brazen, indeed so irresponsible, that they feel they can start giving out information of a highly sensitive nature on security matters.The granting of a contract to Huawei, the Chinese company, to supply equipment for the UKrsquos G mobile phone networks is controversial.Several ministers at the NSC expressed concerns about security Huawei operates under the governance of a Communist regime.Indeed, the US has barred Huawei from involvement in official networks and has put pressure on its Five Eyes intelligence partners like Britain to do the same because of security concerns surrounding the companys links with the Chinese Government.At the CyberUK conference in Glasgow, David Lidington, the PMrsquos de facto deputy, sought to allay fears, emphasising the Government would do nothing to compromise national security. He insisted UK ministers took the security of the countryrsquos telecommunications networks extremely seriously and there were ldquorigorous and tested procedures in place to manage any risks.But the whys and wherefores of Huaweirsquos involvement in the UKrsquos digital future has been overshadowed by process on two fronts.Firstly, apart from anything , the leak undermines the very fabric of good government.The NSC is meant to be a forum where senior ministers and security officials from the likes of MI and MI can discuss frankly highly sensitive material.If any of them feel that what they say can end up on the front of a newspaper or at the top of a news bulletin, then they are going to think twice about offering honest opinion, which, in theory at least, could not only compromise the nationrsquos security but also cost lives.Secondly, there is the political dimension. The suggestion is that the person who leaked the Huawei information was doing so to enhance their leadership credentials ie to be seen to be ldquotough on China. Although without knowing who the leaker is, it is dficult to see how this could be of any benefit. Indeed, the phrase crass stupidity springs to mind.Nonetheless, with such a claim hovering over Westminster senior Cabinet minister after senior Cabinet minister broke cover yesterday to decry the ldquoutterly appalling leak and insist: ldquoIt was not me, Guv.Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, who also wears another hat as the Governmentrsquos National Security Advisor, once he was peeled from the ceiling, launched a Whitehall probe meeting the demand from across the Commons.In a ldquostrongly-worded letter to all NSC members, he called for full co-operation from ministers and civil servants.But it was not enough. Sir Michael Fallon, the former Defence Secretary, urged No  ie the PM to ldquowake up to the seriousness of the leak and demanded Scotland Yard be called in.Indeed, Lord Ricketts, the former National Security Advisor, suggested an almost Bondlike approach, suggesting investigators from the Security Service, MI, could be brought in \"to make the culprit feel very uncomfortable\".Of course over the years, there have been leak inquiries where top civil servants have sought to get to the bottom of an embarrassing revelation from deep inside Government. But none has ever produced a result none has ever felt the culpritrsquos collar. Except, that is, for one.In the run-up to the  General Election, Alistair Carmichael, the then Scottish Secretary, held up his hand and admitted authorising the leaking of a civil service memo by his special advisor. He initially denied any knowledge, claiming the first he had heard of the leaked memo was when he received a phone-call from a reporter.Frenchgate, as it was dubbed at the time, centred on a claim First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had, in private talks with the French ambassador, secretly admitted to preferring David Cameron to remain as Prime Minister rather than his Labour opponent Ed Miliband. It was, Mr Carmichael obviously believed, political dynamite. The only problem was it was completely untrue.Later, the Orkney and Shetland MP said he \"enormously\" regretted his involvement in the leaking of the memo.While the response to the NSC leak might for a while stem the steady flow of information from the inner sanctum of Whitehall into the public domain, the never-ending tunnel that is Brexit probably means normal service will resume fairly quickly.With a Tory leadership contest on the horizon, Downing Strsquos plumbing is not going to be fixed any time soon."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9766885.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-reveals-her-first-job-was-a-a-door-to-door-tattie-scone-seller","story":"And the First Minister said she was \"terrible\" at it.In fact, she hated it so much she used to get her father to do it for her.Taking part in First Ministers Question Time Next Generation in Edinburgh, run by charities Children in Scotland and Youthlink Scotland, the SNP leader also revealed she gets on average five or six hours of sleep a night.An audience of  young people questioned Ms Sturgeon on a wide range of topics.Asked what her first job was, she said: \"My very first job was selling tattie scones round the doors in Dreghorn where I grew up.\"She laughed as she added: \"And I hated it so much that I used to get my dad to do it for me.\"\"I was terrible at the tattie scone round.\"And when I was a bit older I worked at a petrol station in Dreghorn, which is still there.

While younger patients have a better outlook, overall less than one in five patients survive for longer than five years after diagnosis. Survival rates are poor.Now, the protein that fuels it has been identied for the first time. Known as YTHDF, it triggers and sustains the disease.However, it is not needed for healthy cells to , meaning a medication that destroys YTHDF would be a potential cure.AML is a form of cancer that affects blood cells called myeloid cells, which include red blood cells, platelets and certain types of white blood cells. Patients experience uncontrolled growth of immature myeloid cells and do not produce enough healthy blood cells.Older people are most prone. Standard treatment is chemotherapy. If this fails the only hope is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant.The finding, published in Cell Stem Cell, could lead to a medication with signicantly less harmful side effects than existing chemotherapy.The aim would be to efficiently eliminate blood cancer cells in AML ndash without harming healthy ones.Researchers at Edinburgh University and Queen Mary University of London carried out a series of experiments to understand the role of YTHDF in blood cancer.Tests in blood samples donated by leukaemia patients showed the protein is abundant in cancer cells and tests in mice then found the protein is required to initiate and maintain the disease.Further trials enabled scientists to determine the biological pathway by which interfering with theof YTHDF selectively kills blood cancer cells. Importantly, they also showed the protein is not needed to support theof healthy blood stem cells.These are responsible for the production of all normal blood cells. In fact, blood stem cells were even more active in the absence of YTHDF.Professor Donal OrsquoCarroll, of Edinburgh Universityrsquos School of Biological Sciences, who co-led the research, said: ldquoThe study shows the promise of a novel class of drugs as the basis for cancer and regenerative medicine treatments.AML starts in young white blood cells in the bone marrow.

Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"strong demand at thainstone sale","story":"Over , buyers and sellers attended Thainstone#s collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment on Saturday, April .The sale saw an outstanding , lots forward, and the auction team sold  per cent of all items entered both on-site and online.Commenting Mark Barrack, Head of Specialist Auctions at ANM Group, said: “A strong crowd of buyers was present last week at our April collective auction, which saw consistent prices achieved for good quality lots across all categories.“The day’s leading prices came from two JCB CX excavators which were purchased using our online bidding  and sold to a buyer in England.

We know that breastfeeding can be challenging, but we also know that a problem shared, is often a problem halved. Ensuring that all breastfeeding mums have a reassuring and supportive network is vital.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether she’s done enough to satisfy her followers remains to be seen, but it is clear Sturgeon understands the dangers for the independence cause of losing another referendum and the importance of waiting for consistent signs of majority support in the polls.: Nicola Sturgeon calls for independence referendum by It’s fair enough that, as a Scottish National Party First Minister, she should make plans for a referendum – the clue is in the title. But surely everyone in Scotland, on both sides, can agree that Sturgeon must not take the ‘Theresa May approach’ to losing a vote – just keep repeatedly asking the same question. That’s not worked on MPs with May’s Brexit plan and think of the dismay and isionScotland finds itself facing up to IndyRef in a few years’ time. So those plans should stay on the shelf until there is a sign of a substantial sht in public opinion. On the other side of the argument, it is a mistake for the Conservatives and other Unionist parties to simply try to wish independence away. They need to make an active case for the Union and Scotland’s place in it.Scottish Tory MSP Murdo Fraser recently called for the constitutional make-up of the UK to be changed following the country’s departure from the EU to create a ‘quasi-federal’ United Kingdom. Whether that is right or not, he is at least trying to think of ways to make the Union more appealing to Scots, to seek a settlement that could turn out to be a lasting one.: Kenny MacAskill: Sturgeon did NOT just call for independence referendum by This is still a relatively finely poised debate. If a no-deal Brexit is thrown into the mix, it may well boost support for independence, particularlythe economic damage to the UK is severe. The softer the Brexit, the lower the price will be and the greater the chance that Scotland will accept le outside the EU despite voting - per cent in favour of Remain.The next few years are likely to be heady ones and so perhaps the most important thing is not actually Brexit or independence, but this: remembering to be respectful, considerate and kind to each another.

A total of  per cent want another referendum in the future, but not within the next decade. While  per cent want one within the next two to five years,  per cent want one within the next five to ten years and  per cent did not know.The online survey asked the opinion of , adults across Scotland.The First Minister told MSPs on Wednesday that new legislation would be brought forward at Holyrood by the end of the year, which would provide the framework for a second vote. But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used. So I think there is plenty more that can be done in terms of the Scottish Government using the powers that are already there.”Askedhe would rule out granting a Section  order before , the minister said: “We have made it very clear we don’t think that is justied.”The First Minister indicated the Scottish Government would hold off requesting a Section  order. While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving. Askeda referendum was held on the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”,  per cent said they would vote remain and  per cent said they would vote leave.More respondentssaid leaving the UK would be worse for Scotland’s economy than Brexit, while  per cent thought it would be better.

Let’s therefore hope that this week the First Minister stands by her own words, and doesn’t cave in to her activists ahead of SNP conference.“Nicola Sturgeon should uphold the Sturgeon Test. Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people. Labour and the Tories no longer have a positive vision to offer the people of Scotland. They are running scared of any debate over Scotland’s future.Sturgeon’s comments at the manesto launch came before the Brexit vote later that year which saw a majority of Scots vote to remain in the EU as the UK voted to leave.

And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from ! I think some of us have moved on a bit since then, Graham Fleming, but there will always be a place for infantile name-calling, especially when a depth of comment is so shallow.Ali’s statement is not one everyone would post. Aberdeen University was rejecting the autocratic imposition of a particularly hard-line act of Islamism. Such Islamism is not Islam. Resisting the Sultan’s imposition of restrictions on the freedoms of others is not Islamaphobic, as Ali may already know. Conflating these issues into a  statement, whilst describing the Sultan as a good Muslim, is something an islamaphobe might do, but pointing this out in neutral terms will probably see me attacked for being intolerant.There are hard-line inflexible dogmatic literalists in all major faiths, and the assembled texts of any faith are often contradictory. There are also people who hide their malicious agendas behind statements that might be designed to appear innocuous at first glance. It may seem a little pointless trying to make this kind of thing clear to closeminded hardliners, but the tricks extremists use to influence others have to be exposed. Otherwise we’ll have to live in the kind of society they want, and heaven help us then. It may help to remember that Scotland only abandoned trying to “cure” homosexuality with electro-shock therapy as recently as . Securing a tolerant global community required international cooperation: hence the EU.Sadly Islamophobia is alive and kicking on Shetland. I had to forcefully point out to one of my former, supposedly rational patients, that her extreme views on immigrants were pure fiction. Her online rant  claim being that our immigrant population were full of infectious diseasesand a danger to ourcommunity. That is a total fiction promoted by a malicious racist. She was mirroring a neo-nazi website sadly with the backing of several Shetland folk.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

They know they are in the UK but don’t realise they are on a dferent land mass to England. We provide basic information on housing, hospitals, police serviceand run walkabouts and talk-abouts to bring people around and show them basic things like buying a bus ticket or using an ATM. These are things that you and I take for granted.“Our other main thing is the reach to resilience programme. We deliver family support across Belfast. This can be everything from learning to say no, IT skills, safety on the internet and workshops.“The European employment service programme also provides information on free movement on labour across Europe, something which is attracting huge interest given the threats of Brexit.”It is perhaps the John Hewitt Bar, located just around the corner from the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which is the hidden gem of the organisation.Not many people know that the BURC own the bar as a social enterprise, meaning all profits go back into funding their key projects outlined here.The bar was the first social enterprise bar set up in the north and continues to run as a competitive business in the Cathedral Quarter, serving food and it is very popular for its range of beers.Aisling says the location of the BURC is beneficial for service users and hopes their programmes will continue to benefit those who need them.“These programmes are hugely important. The centre is located on the outskirts of the city centre, people can come all over. We can reach a wider network of people and bring the programmes to them.“We are also keen to deliver programmes in their own areas before they feel safe to come to the city centre office.“Our overall aim is to try and bring people back into the local community.“One such challenge today is some people coming to us to report incidents of racism because they don’t feel comfortable going to police. We can help support them and give them advice on how to deal with such an issue and not just accept it as an everyday occurrence.“Overall, the general feedback from people has been very positive. For mothers, learning how to say no is an important issue. We want to give people the confidence, skills and knowledge to try things a bit dferently and explore the way they react to things.“Many of our programmes have come out of other ones – all our work is led by the inidual and other service users.“We want to give people skills of a community leader to empower themselves and help them in every way possible.”Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre,- Donegall Street Place,Belfast,BT FNTel:   Email: info@burc.org or esol@burc.org For more information, visit www.burc.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its double delight for little daithi","story":"THE family of little Dáithí Mac Gabhann are celebrating after learning that their son has made the shortlist for the annual British Heart Foundation’s Heart Hero awards.It was discovered during a routine -week scan that little Dáithí’s heart had not developed as it should have and it was found that the now two-year-old toddler had Hypoplastic heart syndrome.

Dáithí’s parents Máirtín and Seph told the Andersonstown News how delighted they were to learn of the news and that their visit to London for the event in September will coincide with the toddler’s third birthday. “The British Heart Foundation run their annual Heart Hero award every year,” explained Seph.“Máirtín put in the application for it, it was basically a , word essay and we got an email the other day saying that Dáithí had been shortlisted to the last three. “The event is going to be held in the Globe Theatre in London, we are so over the moon, we can’t believe it,” she said. Seph and Máirtín also spoke of how their campaign has taken striking visual awareness with the addition of Dáithí’s pink Is Deontóir Mé slogan and picture emblazoned on a black taxi.“To see the logo on the taxi fills us with so much pride, everyone is going to see it on the road and evenit makes somebody stop and turn around, maybe think twice about organ donation for a wee second, it makes all the dference.”Máirtín added: “I can’t really put it into words how happy we are to find out that Dáithí has been shortlisted for the Heart Hero award. We have sparked up a great relationship with the British Heart Foundation for a couple of months now. They do absolutely unbelievable work that will benefit Dáithí and people like Dáithí, they also work on the promotion of organ donation as well.“In these very hard times, to hear that Dáithí is worthy of this award is great for us. “We are really looking forward to going back to London as Dáithi’s hospital is not that far from where we are going to be – not that we were looking to go into an ICU ward but we can’t wait to bring Dáithí in. The last time the staff saw him he was such a tiny baby, his chest was open, they were preparing us for the worst. Dáithi is turning three when we are over and we can’t wait to show him off to all the doctors and nurses who saved his le.”“Being from West Belfast, I’ve used black taxis all my le, five times a week, twice a day, all my le. To know we have my son on the taxi in bright pink is brilliant, everytime we see the taxi we cheer, Daithí shouts out the car window ‘meeeeeeeeeee’. We want to thank driver Micky Russell for helping us to create awareness, it looks class, we are delighted,” he said.Micky added: “There are only two things you can see from space, the Great Wall of China and my taxi,” he laughed. “It’s an absolute privilege to have the wrap around on the taxi, to create that visual awareness. The taxi is up and down the road, the Shankill, I’ve tourists in the taxi as well, they would ask ‘why the colour ’ I can say to them about organ donation and Dáithí.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"julie file locked for 45","story":"THE sister of a -year-old Lenadoon girl killed by aplastic bullet in  has hit out a decision to lock the National Archives file on her death for another  years. Julie Livingstone was ing from a local shop on the Stewartstown Road when she was fatally injured by a plastic bullet on , May . The round, which was fired from a British Army vehicle, struck her on the head and she died the next day. Earlier this week, researchers at the Pat Finucane Centre in Derry revealed that files held at the National Archives in Kew, London, relating to Julie’s death are to be kept closed until . Earlier this week it was reported that a further file relating to the plastic bullet death of a child has been locked for decades. -year-old Paul Whitters, who died on April , ,  days after being struck in the head with a plastic bullet fired by the RUC in Derry, has been closed until .It is extremely unusual for inidual files to be held on people killed in the conflict – the fact that these two files relate to schoolchildren has raised questions about why their deaths have been given such attention and what facts lie within the files that the British government wants to hide. The Northern Ireland office has said the files have been closed “in the interest of national security”. Reacting to the discovery, Julie’s sister, Elizabeth Livingstone, said that justice had been withheld from her family “for long enough”.“None of us – my brothers or sisters – are going to be alive by the time the file is opened again,it ever is,” she said. “Our parents have already passed away and nobody who ever knew Julie will be alive by then. What could possibly be pertinent to a -year-old’s death – a child’s death – that needs to be kept a secret  What is it that we’re not allowed to know about our sister’s death  We had to go through three inquests to clear Julie’s name. Ultimately, Julie was found to be an innocent victim, but that was after several years of us struggling to get a fair inquest. We already thought that justice had been withheld from us for long enough.”She continued: “It’s not a case of ‘Are they hiding something ’ This is about what’s being hidden. It’s obviously something that would prove to be an embarrassment to the British government and the NIO. Our Julie was a -year-old innocent victim. She was going about her own business when she was shot in the head and murdered. What could they possibly not want us to know about it  Your imagination runs wild. The only thing we could do for her was to get justice and now this has happened.”Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described the decision to close the files as “perverse”.“The decision to close Julie’s file until  was made earlier this year,” he explained. “There’s another file on plastic bullets in general, which is closed until  and it beggars belief. I have never seen anything like this before. We see lots of files closed for a long time, but these two files on the deaths of children who were killed by plastic bullets, one by the British Army, one by the RUC.” He added: “There is a total culture of secrecy within the NIO, within Ministry of Defence, and from all of those who want to protect the reputation of RUC and the British Army. They don’t want this information to come out, but it will come out. I’m confident that this file will not be closed until .”The Livingstone family have since written to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to request a meeting about the NIO’s decision. Relatives for Justice CEO, Mark Thompson, called on Ms Bradley to order the release of the files.“Julie was  years of age when she was killed by a plastic bullet in ,” he said. “Her father Archie travelled these islands and Europe telling the world what happened to his baby girl. Along with the other families and injured in the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets, he wanted to make a positive dference, to shine a light of truth and justice in the face of the horror his and other families endured. All families who have experienced state violence know that the British government will go to any s to protect its own interest. This strategic policy of impunity for the killing of Irish children clearly extends even to librarians and archives keepers. They too are complicit in the policies that accompany British state violence. This decision, undoubtedly made under direction, was made while families are asked to engage in a consultation on dealing with the past. This discovery points to the bad faith behind this consultation, as well as displaying the callous indference of those responsible. The least Karen Bradley can do now is meet with the families of Julie Livingstone and Paul Whitters. The very least the keeper of the archives can do under Bradley’s instruction is give the families these files.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"president to open connolly museum","story":"PRESIDENT Michael D Higgins will officially open the new Áras Uí Chonghaile  James Connolly Visitor Centre on the Falls Road on Friday.

Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision.

I have no idea what you Sara, Lyra’s partner must have felt on Thursday night when those shots rang out and Lyra was hit and fell to the ground.I can’t begin to imagine what you Lyra’s mum, and you her sisters and brothers must have gone through when Sara phoned to tell you Lyra had been shot. I can’t imagine the agony of your drive to Altnagelvin hospital knowing that Lyra had died.Many of us here in this cathedral have been praying for you since we heard the dreadful news and will continue to do so.Since the story of Lyra’s murder broke on Holy Thursday into Good Friday, there has been an enormous sense of grief and solidarity with you from many people at this huge injustice. Many, many wonderful things have been said about her including the warm and deserved tributes paid to her by the Secretary of State and by MPs of all parties in the House of Commons yesterday evening. In death Lyra, has united people of many dferent backgrounds, as further evidenced by this erse congregation at her funeral.Like so many others I couldn’t believe it when I heard the am news on Good Friday morning that Lyra McKee had been shot dead the previous night. I’d met Lyra on several occasions, we had kept in contact by phone, ‘what’s app’,and Twitter. I would however have to confess that I wasn’t aware of her great love of Harry Potter. I hadn’t heard the term ‘Hufflepuff’ until I did an internet search and found this definition # ‘Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.’ It struck me that the definition could just as easily have been about Lyra. Whilst Harry Potter didn’t feature in our conversations what did and it was our last exchange on Twitter at the end of March when Lyra tweeted me with a photo of herself dressed in a nun’s veil with a glass of cider accompanied with these words: ‘Got roped into performing as part of a Sister Act tribute act for Foyle Hospice. Hey @MartinJMagill, you need any help with mass tomorrow ’Let me give a brief overview of Lyra’s le. She was born on st March . She attended Holy Family PS just off the Limestone Road. In her early days at school, she struggled with reading and required extra support.Things changed dramatically when one of her teachers, Mr O’Neill began to read to her class The Twits by Roald Dahl. This was the spark that got Lyra interested in reading and then thanks to her granny Patricia Lawrie buying her each of the Harry Potter books as they were published this led to her le long interest in Harry Potter and later on to exchanges in social media with JK Rowling.Lyra’s love of reading was further nurtured when she went to St Gemma’s High School, just off the Oldpark Road also in North Belfast. Her interest in journalism began at the age of  when she wrote for the St Gemma’s school newspaper.Shortly afterwards Lyra became involved in a charity called “The Headliners’ which gives young people a voice by using journalism and media as a tool for learning and campaigning. This project played an important part in her being awarded the Sky News Young Journalist Award . After school and further education, Lyra studied online journalism at Birmingham City University graduating with an MA degree. Over the years her writing has won her much acclaim such as her letter when she was  to her  year old self about growing up as gay in Belfast. In , aged just , she was acknowledged internationallyas an exceptional achiever with an exciting future by Forbes magazine in their  under  listbecause of her work as an investigative reporter.Last month thefeatured Lyra in an article considering the  rising stars of Irish writing. Her memory also lives on in her TEDx talk, #How uncomfortable conversations can save lives”, about the  Orlando nightclub shooting. Her book on the murder of Rev Robert Bradford, the Member of Parliament for South Belfast, called Angels with Blue Faces was due to be published later this year.Lyra came to see me as part of her research on a book she was working on called Lost Boys. We met on several occasions and kept in contact. I knew absolutely nothing about  year old Thomas Spence and  year old John Rodgers, who vanished at a bus stop onthe Falls Road in West Belfast in November . They were both living in St John’s Parish at that time where I am presently the parish priest and it was for this reason Lyra came to see me. By the time Lyra had told me their story and what she hoped to do, I was fully behind her. Nichola her sister who spoke earlier described Lyra like #a dog with a bone’ when she had found something that interested her.I certainly experienced her gentle, determined doggedness. When we exchanged greetings on New Year’s Day and I wished her well not only in the writing of Lost Boys but also in her search for the remains of the boys which she made clear to me was very important to her. She replied in this way: ‘If that#s the only thing that comes out of this, it#ll be worth it. It#s the only thing I really want out of it, to find them and the others.’In the course of her investigations, Lyra had discovered that other children had disappeared and she had wanted to find their bodies.I pray that her work will be taken up and that their bodies will be found and even more importantly that there will be no more ‘lost boys’ or ‘lost girls.’When I consider Lyra’s determination, it strikes me that she was the embodiment of the St Gemma’s school motto: ‘truth and charity.’ On Good Friday, the day on which Christians all over the world recall the suffering and death of Jesus Christ we also wrestle with the mystery of suffering. For you Lyra’s nearest and dearest, you came to know the experience of Good Friday in your own lives. For those of us who follow Jesus, we believe that the shedding of his innocent blood on the cross was enough # in the words of the hymn: ‘the cross has said it all’. We don’t need any more innocent blood to be shed.The irony could not be more poignant when we consider the signing of the Good Friday agreement which was about ensuring there would be no more deaths like Lyra’s. Earlier in this service, we listened to Matthew’s account of the Beatitudes which was chosen by her family in remembrance of Lyra learning these by heart when she was a pupil at St Gemma’s. The beatitude ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God’is very timely. Many of us will be praying that Lyra’s death in its own way will not have been in vain and will contribute in some way to building peace here. Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in ious places and the unying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am however left with a question: ‘Why in God’s name does it take the death of a  year old woman with her whole le in front of her to get us to this point ’ As Christians recalled the death of Jesus on the cross, we remembered that his death was not in vain but was for us the doorway to eternal le. I dare to hope that Lyra’s murder on Holy Thursday night can be the doorway to a new beginning. I detect a deep desire for this. One of Lyra’s friends was reported as saying: ‘We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don#t need guns put in their hands.They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ To those who had any part in her murder, I encourage you to reflect on Lyra McKee journalist and writer as a powerful example of ‘The pen is mightier than the sword’.I plead with you to take the road of non violence to achieve your political ends. It was encouraging to see that those who provide a political analysis to the organisation responsible for her death chose to call off their parade on Easter Monday following the call from Fr Joe Gormley, the parish priest in Creggan where Lyra was killed. To those still intent on violence, I ask you to listen to the majority of the people on your beloved island of Ireland who are calling on you to stop. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of the women who in a very powerful gesture of non violence,one by one placed their hands in blood red paint on a wall and said loudly ‘we are not afraid.’ I commend the + people in Creggan who have contacted the police. There is a rule in many of our communities that we do not, we should not, give information to police and that, to do so is to become a ‘tout.’ But that was one of a number of rules # rules that also said that it was OK to brutalise children for petty crimes, or rules that say you can live in the locality until you are told you can’t or rules that said that the only way we could gain ‘freedom’ was by other fellow-human beings losing their lives. But this week I have seen these rules turned on their head. I have seen many people stand up and condemn this culture of violence and coercive control. We need to send a very dferent message and so I appeal to those who have information about Lyra’s murder but who haven#t yet come forward to do so now. If you want to see an end to these brutal rules, and see a new society built on justice and fairness, on hope and not fear, then you can help build that society by letting the police know what you know. There will be special measures put in place to ensure your safety and where you will not be intimidated by coercive controllers,you do so.To the many politicians present in this cathedral today, let me say again those words which one of Lyra’s friends had said: ’the younger generation need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ As politicians you will be familiar with the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission published last October which examined in depth paramilitary style attacks and found a clear correlation between these attacks and areas of social deprivation. Lyra’s friend is right in pointing out that our young people need jobs, and education and training to get those jobs. All our young people need a le that gives them an aspiration for the future. As our politicians we need you to be working together to make that happen so that especially for those living in deprived areas that they will feel the peace process is working for them as well – and especially for young people living in these communities. To the press and media which Lyra was so proud to be part of – I ask you to report on what is being done in these areas – to praise good work where you find it and report when it is not happening. I know you as politicians have a very dficult job to but then so too did Lyra. There is another valuable lesson from her le # she was like ‘a dog with a bone’ when she believed she could make a dference. When it comes to our peace process, I would love to see this dogged attitude to the rebuilding of an Assembly that works for the common good. As I listen to the radio every morning, all I seem to hear about ious initiatives in Northern Ireland are these words, ‘without a minister, this can’t be taken forward’. I pray that Lyra’s murder may be the catalyst needed for parties to start talking, to reform that which was corrosive in previous Assemblies and to begin anew. On Easter Sunday, Christians all over the world celebrated the most important event of the Christian year, the resurrection of Jesus. It was because of his resurrection that we believe in le beyond the grave and in the words of today’s second reading from John : ‘in my Father’s house there are many dwelling places.’ It is in this hope of eternal le and happiness that we gather in prayer and now into the tender mercy of a loving God and Father I commend Lyra McKee.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September.

We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"exunionist mps country pile sells after three years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

ministers over the leak of secret discussions by the UK’s top national security body..pushTheresa May is facing calls for a full police inquiry after the disclosure of discussions on whether to grant Chinese telecoms giant Huawei the go-ahead to participate in the UK’s G communications network.MPs denounced the unprecedented leak following Tuesday’s meeting of the National Security Councilas “completely shocking” and called for action to find the perpetrator.Reports have emerged that Whitehall’s most powerful official, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, has demanded ministers in attendance at the council meeting confess or denythey were behind the leak. and Sir Mark Sedwill arrive in Downing Street for a Cabinet meeting. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Huntand Sir Mark Sedwill arrive in Downing Street for a Cabinet meeting.  reported that Sir Mark has written to order those present to tell him “immediately” whether they were involved.Downing Street refused to say whether a leak inquiry was already under way but insisted the Prime Minister regarded the protection of information concerning national security as a “matter of the highest importance”.Two Cabinet ministers – Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt – publicly denied that they were responsible.However, former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said a Whitehall leak inquiry by civil servants was insufficient and that only a proper Scotland Yard investigation could get to the truth.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sir Michael Fallon has called for a full police inquiry into the NSC leak He said Cabinet ministers attending the meeting should have their mobile phones checked to seethey contacted journalists afterwards, andanyone was found to be responsible they should be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act.A Met Police spokeswoman said she could neither confirm nor deny any police investigation had been requested or was under way and Downing Street sources refused to comment on security matters point blank.Former minister Andrew Mitchell said Mrs May should order MI to conduct a full investigation, which could include interviewing Cabinet ministersnecessary.The anger among MPs reflected concerns that the leak from the NSC – where senior ministers are briefed by intelligence chiefs from MI, MI and GCHQ – could damage intelligence-sharing relations with key allies.It followed a report in The Dailythat Mrs May – who chaired the meeting – had overridden the objections of key ministers to give the green light for Chinese tech giant Huawei to participate in the UK’s G communications network.Five ministers – Mr Hunt, Mr Williamson, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox – were reported as having expressed concern.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jeremy Hunt has denied he was responsible for the NSC leak David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister and Mrs May’s de facto deputy, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also sit on the NSC, while it is thought other ministers attend when it is relevant to do so.MPs immediately linked the disclosure to the manoeuvrings around the Tory leadership, with whoever was responsible seeking to burnish their credentials as being “tough on China”.At a lunch for Westminster journalists, Mr Hunt flatly denied that it was him.“I think it is utterly appalling that that should happen,” he said.“I have never leaked confidential Cabinet discussions and I never will.”In a statement, Mr Williamson said neither he nor any of his team had “ulged information from the National Security Council”.Mr Javid, visiting a police training college in Kent, said it was “completely unacceptable” for any minister to release sensitive information and that it should “absolutely be looked at”.Calls for an inquiry were backed by former national security adviser Lord Ricketts, who said it was the first major leak from the NSC since its inception in .He suggested investigators from the Security Service, MI, could be brought in “to make the culprit feel very uncomfortable”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said a criminal investigation had not been ruled out In the Commons, Labour also demanded an inquiry with shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt saying it would be “truly shocking”the leak was to gain advantage in a Tory leadership contest.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told MPs a criminal investigation had not been ruled out, saying it was essential the intelligence agencies had confidence that advice given to ministers would remain private.“If they do not feel that, they will not give us that advice and Government will be worse as a result,” he said.He repeated the Government’s assertion that no final decision has been made on whether Huawei should be allowed to bid for contracts in the G network.Meanwhile, the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, wrote to Sir Mark to say he had been contacted by “some of our closest allies and partners” expressing their concerns at the leak.“This is particularly true for those with whom we share the closest intelligence networks,” he said.Dominic Grieve, the chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee which oversees the work of the agencies, said the leak was “deeply worrying”.“The principle that what is discussed at the NSC is kept totally confidential is really important,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"competition watchdog blocks sainsburysasda merger","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

It included investing £ billion a year in lowering prices by the third year of the deal completing, equating to a % cut on everyday items.Mr Coupe said on Thursday: “The specic reason for wanting to merge was to lower prices for customers. The CMA’s conclusion that we would increase prices post-merger ignores the dynamic and highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market. The CMA is today effectively taking £ billion out of customers’ pockets.”Sainsbury’s, Walmart and Asda have now mutually agreed to terminate the transaction.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  It is the first major CMA decision since the appointment of former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie as chairman Shares in Sainsbury’s tumbled over % in morning trade to .p.A merger between the duo, the UK’s number two and three supermarkets, would have created a supermarket titan bigger than Tesco with revenues of £ billion and a network of , Sainsbury’s, Asda and Argos stores.But fears had been expressed that suppliers could get squeezed as a result, with the tie-up giving the merged entity increased buying power.The move to reject the merger marks the first major decision the CMA has made since the appointment of former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie as chairman.Best known for his role as head of the influential Treasury Select Committee, Mr Tyrie gained a reputation as an effective inquisitor of corporate figures.It remains unclear where the duo go from here, but it is understood that Walmart will continue to look to sell Asda to another buyer.Walmart chief executive Judith McKenna said: “While we’re disappointed by the CMA’s final report and conclusions, our focus now is continuing to position Asda as a strong UK retailer delivering for customers. Walmart will ensure Asda has the resources it needs to achieve that.”Roger Burnley, the Asda boss, said that he is “disappointed” in the CMA’s decision.Unions reacted with delight at the decision, with the GMB and Unite hailing it as a victory for staff amid fears of store closures and job losses as a result of the deal.Attention will now turn to Mr Coupe, who is expected to face questions over his future following the breakdown of the deal.The chief executive drew criticism last year after he was caught on camera singing “we’re in the money” following the merger announcement.He later apologised, calling it an “unfortunate choice of song” from the musical nd Street."},{"url":null,"title":"its a kind thing to do dukes visit brings comfort to christchurch families","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support.

After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm.

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening. If the work can be completed ahead of schedule this would be welcomed, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Work set to resume at old Downe  ","story":"BUILDING work on a new social housing project at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick is due to resume in the near future.Contractors moved off site a few weeks ago after laying foundations for a number of new homes whichare being built on behalf of Clanmill Housing.An initial  homes are being built part as part of a major social housing project at the site where around  new homes could eventually be constructed.While concern has recently been expressed locally about the halt to construction work at the site,Clanmill has explained that there is a valid reason.The social housing provider said it is aware that work at the sprawling town centre site mdash which borders four main roads mdash has ceased for a short period of time.ldquoThe developerrsquos subcontractor is awaiting the arrival on site of a piling rig to allow work to continue, she explained.ldquoWe appreciate the continued support and patience of local residents as construction continues and are looking forward to welcoming families to the first phase of the development later in the year as planned.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.Itrsquos understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, is pleased that the suspension to building work is only temporary.ldquoThe redevelopment of the former hospital site will go some way to reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick, he said.ldquoThe Clanmill project is an eagerly awaited development. Not only will it provide much-needed new homes, but greatly assist with the social and economic regeneration of this particular part of the town. People are eager to see the first tenants move into their new homes and the transformation of this particular site.Cllr Curran said he is also pleased that tenants could be in their new homes later in the year.ldquoWe have a number of people on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category. They will no doubt be eagerly monitoring the progress of building work at the old Downe complex, he continued.Cllr Curran added: ldquoHaving viewed plans for the redevelopment of the entire site, I can say that they are particularly impressive and will transform what had become a blot on the landscape into a vibrant, and much-needed social housing development..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8803916.jpg","title":"fivemiletown creamery site to close with  jobs lost","story":"In May , Dale Farm bought the Fivemiletown speciality cheese brand from Glanbia Ingredients Ireland and reached agreement with Fivemiletown  Brookeborough Co-operative to take over the production of its cheese at the Fivemiletown site.

He said: “The RHI scheme did not of itself provide any enhanced financial benefits to Moy Park.”Today senior Moy Park executive Justin Coleman appeared before MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee which is investigating the retrospective slashing of RHI payments.Mr Coleman, the poultry giant’s agri business and live production services director, admitted under questioning from North Down MP Lady Hermon that the company had benefited from RHI.However, when pressed to quanty that benefit he said it was “very dficult to put a number on it”.He said that the benefit “could be measured in terms of feed conversion or mortality or average daily gain ... soa grower [farmer] improves his feed conversion by a point, Moy Park will get half and the grower will keep half, for argument’s sake.“So it’s very dficult to say RHI would have benefited the grower or Moy Park by X. RHI per se would not have changed the landscape. The heating system [which RHI paid for] would have changed the landscape.”Lady Hermon doggedly attempted to establish how much RHI had enhanced Moy Park’s profitability. She put it to him: “I’m sure that somewhere, with the sophistication of Moy Park, that there is a figure as to how well Moy Park did as a result, indirectly, of the RHI scheme.”Mr Coleman said that “putting a number on one component part ... is very dficult to do”.Here is how you can help farmers who are struggling with rise in sheep thefts and illegal butchery Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He went on to admit that “performance did improve, without a shadow of a doubt”, adding: “I’m not saying that RHI was % of the reason for the performance improvement.”When asked how Moy Park was going to assist those who took its advice to enter RHI and now were in financial dficulty, he said: “In reality, Moy Park’s not going to bail out a failed government scheme.”Ian Paisley stressed the importance of Moy Park to the Northern Ireland economy.

Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

investigation","story":"Theresa May is facing calls for a full police inquiry after the disclosure of discussions on whether to grant Chinese telecoms giant Huawei the go-ahead to participate in the UKrsquos G communications network.MPs denounced the unprecedented leak following Tuesdayrsquos meeting of the National Security Councilas ldquocompletely shocking and called for action to find the perpetrator.Reports have emerged that Whitehallrsquos most powerful official, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, has demanded ministers in attendance at the council meeting confess or denythey were behind the leak. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Huntand Sir Mark Sedwill arrive in Downing Street for a Cabinet meeting.  -- reported that Sir Mark has written to order those present to tell him ldquoimmediately whether they were involved.Downing Street refused to say whether a leak inquiry was already under way but insisted the Prime Minister regarded the protection of information concerning national security as a ldquomatter of the highest importance.Two Cabinet ministers ndash Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt ndash publicly denied that they were responsible.However, former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said a Whitehall leak inquiry by civil servants was insufficient and that only a proper Scotland Yard investigation could get to the truth. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Sir Michael Fallon has called for a full police inquiry into the NSC leak  --He said Cabinet ministers attending the meeting should have their mobile phones checked to seethey contacted journalists afterwards, andanyone was found to be responsible they should be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act.A Met Police spokeswoman said she could neither confirm nor deny any police investigation had been requested or was under way and Downing Street sources refused to comment on security matters point blank.Former minister Andrew Mitchell said Mrs May should order MI to conduct a full investigation, which could include interviewing Cabinet ministersnecessary.The anger among MPs reflected concerns that the leak from the NSC ndash where senior ministers are briefed by intelligence chiefs from MI, MI and GCHQ ndash could damage intelligence-sharing relations with key allies.It followed a report in The Dailythat Mrs May ndash who chaired the meeting ndash had overridden the objections of key ministers to give the green light for Chinese tech giant Huawei to participate in the UKrsquos G communications network.Five ministers ndash Mr Hunt, Mr Williamson, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox ndash were reported as having expressed concern. -- vw,vw,px,

Clark and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also sit on the NSC, while it is thought other ministers attend when it is relevant to do so.MPs immediately linked the disclosure to the manoeuvrings around the Tory leadership, with whoever was responsible seeking to burnish their credentials as being ldquotough on China.At a lunch for Westminster journalists, Mr Hunt flatly denied that it was him.ldquoI think it is utterly appalling that that should happen, he said.ldquoI have never leaked confidential Cabinet discussions and I never will.In a statement, Mr Williamson said neither he nor any of his team had ldquoulged information from the National Security Council.Mr Javid, visiting a police training college in Kent, said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable for any minister to release sensitive information and that it should ldquoabsolutely be looked at. -- --Calls for an inquiry were backed by former national security adviser Lord Ricketts, who said it was the first major leak from the NSC since its inception in .He suggested investigators from the Security Service, MI, could be brought in ldquoto make the culprit feel very uncomfortable. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said a criminal investigation had not been ruled out  --In the Commons, Labour also demanded an inquiry with shadow Cabinet Office minister Jo Platt saying it would be ldquotruly shockingthe leak was to gain advantage in a Tory leadership contest.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told MPs a criminal investigation had not been ruled out, saying it was essential the intelligence agencies had confidence that advice given to ministers would remain private.ldquoIf they do not feel that, they will not give us that advice and Government will be worse as a result, he said.He repeated the Governmentrsquos assertion that no final decision has been made on whetherHuaweishould be allowed to bid for contracts in the G network.Meanwhile, the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, wrote to Sir Mark to say he had been contacted by ldquosome of our closest allies and partners expressing their concerns at the leak.ldquoThis is particularly true for those with whom we share the closest intelligence networks, he said.Dominic Grieve, the chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee which oversees the work of the agencies, said the leak was ldquodeeply worrying.ldquoThe principle that what is discussed at the NSC is kept totally confidential is really important, he said..push,i[r].l*new

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/stats_r1.jpg","title":"statsports takes on premier leagues alex oxlade chamberlain and raheem sterling","story":"Posted on Thursday  April  by Ulster Business Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and chief global strategist Jarlath Quinn Newry firm STATSports have taken on board Premier League players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling as signicant investors as well as global ambassadors for the burgeoning tech firm.
