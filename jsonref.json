It was a magnificent and stylish conceit that might even have worked, Bayley says, but Conran vetoed the idea as too expensive.The orce that followed was painful, both emotionally and financially. The judge estimated Conran\u0027s fortune at £80 million and awarded Caroline a then-record settlement of £10.5 million.\u0027The figure is unbelievable,\u0027 Conran complained. \u0027Just because she cooked a few meals now and again and wrote a few books.

My father was very busy let\u0027s put it that way.\u0027Terence could be genial, but he was not quick to encourage others, Bayley notes. When his eldest son, Sebastian, worked for him briefly, Conran complained in a newspaper interview that he lacked focus.When Jasper joined the company in 2012 and became the anointed heir, a battle reminiscent of the TV series Succession ensued. Conran complained (again in a newspaper) that Jasper \u0027never, or hardly ever, talks to me . . . I kept on saying: \u0027I\u0027ve got the experience and the knowledge. I know things you don\u0027t\u0027.\u0027 In 2016, Jasper resigned.As he got older, Conran was dogged by back pain, the result of a car accident in India years earlier.

In his final years, having separated from wife number four, Vicki, he cut a sad figure.

The actor and activist has also appeared in The Green Mile, LA Confidential and, most recently, the TV series SuccessionThe actor who teamed up with a pig called Babe to take the world of sheep trials by storm, and was nominated for an Oscar for his efforts, has written to the Minister for Agriculture to condemn the practice of live pig exports and to plead with the Government to suspend plans to ship breeding sows to China.In the letter activist and actor James Cromwell – whose screen credits include The Green Mile, LA Confidential, The Queen, Spider-Man and, most recently, Succession – condemned the export of live animals generally as a “stain on humanity” and the export of live pigs to China in particular as “both unnecessary and cruel”.China ramped up imports of breeding pigs last year to meet surging demand after the country’s herd was decimated by the deadly African swine fever.In recent weeks the Minister for Agriculture, Charlie McConalogue, confirmed that an agreement had been reached with the Chinese authorities to pave the way for the export of breeding pigs from Ireland to China.“I had the great privilege and pleasure of learning about pigs when I starred in the movie Babe. They’re fascinating animals who possess a remarkable capacity for love and joy – as well as sorrow,” Cromwell said in the letter.‘Breeding machines’“I was therefore shocked to hear about your plans to export these wonderful animals from Ireland to China, where they’ll be used as breeding machines. And I urge you, on behalf of kind people everywhere, to reconsider,” he continued.He argued that treating pigs as cargo – forcing them to endure a long journey in cramped cages while exposing them to excessive noise and changes in air pressure – is both unnecessary and cruel, and it would cause immense stress to these sensitive animals. “Worse still, whatever protections they might have in Ireland fly completely out the window when they arrive in China where there are no laws to protect animals on farms.”He concluded by saying that “pigs deserve better than this” and he pleaded with Mr McConalogue to “see that shipping pigs abroad does not align with the friendly spirit Ireland is known for” and to “do the right thing and reverse this decision. Better still, ban the live export trade – a stain on humanity – entirely.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin car commuting at 90 of pre coronavirus volumes","story":"Dublin commuter traffic has reached its highest point since the Covid-19 pandemic began, with the number of cars in the city at 90 per cent of January 2020 levels.Despite a renewed appeal from the Government and health authorities for people to continue working from home, and climate action plans seeking a cut in car use, motorists have been returning to the city in increasing numbers, according to Dublin City Council. While public transport returned to full capacity from the beginning of September, passenger numbers on Dublin Bus have levelled off at just over 70 per cent of pre-Covid figures, indicating a reluctance of commuters to switch back from cars to buses.However, cycling numbers have returned to pre-Covid levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic, following significant investment in safer cycling infrastructure in the city over the last 18 months.Meanwhile, increases in Dublin parking charges up to €3.50 an hour are to be introduced almost two years after they were proposed.The increase in parking charges of about 10 per cent across all zones was approved by councillors in late 2019 and was due to come into force last year, but was delayed due to the pandemic.In a report to be presented to councillors next week, the council’s parking enforcement officer Dermot Stevenson said it was an objective of the city development plan to “renew restrictions on the use and cost of on street parking and change them as necessary, in order to discourage commuter parking”.Four submissionsHe noted that four submissions were made to the council in relation to the proposal to increase the charges, three were in favour on the grounds it would discourage vehicle use, have an impact on congestion, air and noise pollution, and create a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists.The fourth submission did not comment on the proposed increase in parking charges but requested parking street signage would include a description of the colour of the zone in writing to aid people who are colour blind.The new charges will mean parking in the city centre “yellow zone” rise from €3.20 to €3.50 an hour, while just outside this area the “red zone” charge will go from €2.70 to €3. The outer “green zone” will increase from €1.60 to €1.80, while the low demand “orange zone” will go from €1 to €1.10. Lower rates will apply for those using parking tags instead of cash.The Government’s climate action plan published this week proposes the introduction of “demand management” measures to discourage car usage to achieve a 51 per cent reduction in transport emissions.More work is required to “fully define the pathways” to reduce car use, the plan states, but consideration will be given to the implementation of “low emission zones” which restrict access of polluting vehicles, and “road pricing systems” commonly known as congestion charges.Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan said both measures were likely to require primary legislation before they could be introduced in the city, but were “two options that are worthy of consideration”.Suggestions that could change Dublin for the better"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Young protesters in Glasgow for Cop26 will have much to fight againstStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"green light for five garth brooks concerts at croke park in 2022","story":"In 2014 Dublin City Council refused licences for two of five planned concerts, leading to the cancellation of all shows.Dublin City Council has granted event licences for five Garth Brooks concerts to go ahead in Croke Park in 2022.

His role in the “Votegate” double-voting controversy a couple of months before the general election was seen as a factor in his downfall.While Timmy’s Dáil career was scuppered in the aftermath, an internal Oireachtas investigation into the incident is alive and well. Former Fine Gael TD Noel Rock made a complaint to the Dáil’s Committee on Members’ Interests in October 2019 after Dooley was recorded as having voted six times in one session even though he wasn’t in the chamber at the time.It subsequently emerged that his colleague Niall Collins, who voted in the adjacent seat, had pressed his colleague’s button as well as his own.A raft of investigations followed along with contrite apologies from Collins and Dooley. The Ceann Comhairle and Clerk of the Dáil looked into the affair and took a very dim view while the ethics committee dithered its way into the following year.A general election was called in January.Timmy Dooley lost his seat but Micheál Martin threw him a lifeline with a Taoiseach’s nomination to the Seanad. Then Covid struck. The new Coalition Government wasn’t formed until June.Everybody forgot about the War of the Buttons.But at this week’s meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight (formerly the Committee on Procedure and Privileges), Votegate reared its head again.The Ceann Comhairle told members that representatives of the Seanad Committee on Members’ Interests have requested all official documents and video relating to the complaint made against then deputy, now Senator, Dooley. Under the ethics act, if an election happens while a case is still active and the TD involved is re-elected, the investigation transfers to the new Dáil.A parliamentary legal advisor explained to TDs on Wednesday that if the person under investigation is subsequently elected to the Seanad, then the legal duty to investigate moves over to the Upper House.The oversight committee agreed to grant the Seanad committee access to all the material gathered so far by its Dáil counterpart. No doubt Senator Dooley is delighted.It’s been two years since Votegate, so it’s easily forgotten that Noel Rock also lodged related complaints against Niall Collins and Barry Cowen.Presumably this means the complaint against Collins and Cowen is still active too? If so, when will the outcome of the carried-over investigations be known?Because Fianna Fáíl will be delighted to have the embarrassing electronic voting saga dragged up for an airing once again.He didn’t do it.A portrait artist did it, egged on by members of the Seanad Independent group.We understand that David, who holds the title “Father of the House” as the Seanad’s longest serving Senator, has been given a sneak preview of the work commissioned by his colleagues in his honour. It will be presented to him by Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl at a special ceremony on Wednesday in Leinster House.We’re not sure if it has a title.“A portrait of Senator Norris executed by artist William Nathans” certainly has a touch of the Caravaggios about it, but the finished painting should be less dramatic than what is promised in the invitation. One of Nathans’s recent commissions is the official portrait of Susan Denham, the first woman chief justice of Ireland, which hangs in the King’s Inns.David’s fellow Independent group members, including Victor Boyhan, Rónán Mullen, Michael McDowell, Sharon Keogan and Gerard Craughwell, organised the portrait to mark his contribution to Irish society and his “phenomenal” work in the Seanad. Mark Daly, Cathaoirleach of the Upper House, will attend the unveiling along with representatives of the various groupings and parties.Trinity provost Prof Linda Doyle is also expected, along with a small number of the distinguished sitter’s family and friends.The Senator has been doing a lot of sitting these days.In July, in his final engagement as provost of Trinity College, Patrick Prendergast unveiled a portrait of university senator Norris. It now hangs in the anteroom of the Provost’s House, near a portrait of former chancellor Mary Robinson. They graduated from Trinity in the same year.This got some of the Senators thinking.“Maybe we could hang David in Leinster House,” mused one of them. “I love saying that.”Of course, Norris can do what he likes with his portrait. But there is a feeling, particularly among his Independent group colleagues, that the man who holds the record for the longest continuous period of service should have his own spot on the wall near the Seanad chamber, which boasts a very fine anteroom.That decision would rest with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, who is doing the honours on Wednesday.We expect a spot to be cleared.Guests at the event in the DLR Lexicon perhaps got more than they bargained for when the guest of honour produced an exuberant star turn, performing what one delighted observer described as “a 30-minute stand-up routine.”No disrespect to Prof Robinson, but she wouldn’t be well known for her wicked sense of humour or for doing funny voices. A touch on the aloof side, some might say.Not so last week. Mary was on a roll at the launch, cracking out the one-liners as she waved the book around while peppering her speech with vignettes from various presidential lives. Her audience was both startled and delighted.“Nobody’s ever seen the like of this before,” said our source close to the canapes, in tones of disbelief.Right enough, you don’t expect to hear former president Robinson impersonating a scandalised politician who wrote to taoiseach WT Cosgrave in 1937 complaining about uppity women.Something would have to be done about “suffragette agitation”, urged former government minister JJ Walsh in his letter. During the foundation of the State these women got above themselves and “their poisonous fangs were everywhere in evidence”. “It is time the wheel was reversed,” he wrote.Mary Robinson liked “poisonous fangs” so much she repeated it twice, in what she imagined was JJ Walsh’s accent.She also read from the memo sent by Douglas Hyde’s secretary Michael McDunphy back in 1944, revelling in the detail of what was described as a precedent-setting meeting between president Hyde and taoiseach Éamon de Valera. De Valera had arrived in the Áras at a very late hour to seek a dissolution of the Dáil.The president’s secretary had to cycle from Clontarf on his bicycle at very short notice. When he arrived he discovered that the meeting was convened in the 84-year-old president’s bedroom.To much hilarity, Robinson revealed a previously unknown fact: “I just want to assure you that if the meeting place was regarded as setting a precedent, it was a precedent not followed by me.”As her audience cracked up, she deadpanned: “I worked with four taoisigh, and I can assure you I never met anyone of them in my bedroom.Apparently her timing was perfect.The Presidents’ Letters has been described as “a treasure trove” of hundreds of letters, memos, cards, telegrams, drawings, notes and photographs assembled by the author, most of which have never been published before.The book, already into its first reprint, is published by New Island Books."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Circassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"us expects delays as travel restrictions lift on monday","story":"The US preclearance section of Dublin Airport The United States is preparing for long lines and delays on Monday when restrictions are lifted on non-US citizen international travellers who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, a senior official told Reuters on Friday.President Joe Biden’s administration “expects pent-up demand for travel, which means longer than normal wait times for travellers,” the official said. The government was boosting staffing to pre-pandemic levels but “long lines are expected in the initial days.”The United States on Monday is lifting travel restrictions for fully vaccinated air travellers from 33 countries and at its land borders with Mexico and Canada, ending the historic entry bans to address the spread of Covid-19 for much of the world’s population.The official said land-border traffic has been about 70 per cent of 2019 levels on the southwest border and 30 per cent of 2019 levels on the northern border.US Customs and Border Protection “will continue to adjust its resources to meet traffic workload demands and ensure operational security, while balancing its trade facilitation and national security mission,” the official said. Travellers should familiarise themselves with the new guidelines and have their documentation ready in advance, the official said.Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian has also said travellers should be prepared for long lines initially from Monday.“It’s going to be a bit sloppy at first. I can assure you, there will be lines unfortunately ... but we’ll get it sorted out,” Mr Bastian said.Delta said in the six weeks since the US reopening was announced it has had a 450 per cent increase in international point-of-sale bookings.United Airlines is expecting about 50 per cent more total international inbound passengers on Monday compared to November 1st when it had about 20,000.The Biden administration has held multiple calls with US airlines to prepare for the influx of additional travellers who will begin arriving at the country’s airports.The restrictions, put in place in early 2020 during the pandemic, barred most non-US citizens who within the last 14 days had been in any of 33 countries – the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls, Ireland, the UK, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil. Also on Monday, new contact-tracing rules will take effect requiring airlines to collect information from international air passengers if needed “to follow up with travellers who have been exposed to Covid-19 variants or other pathogens.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sets royal marines apart us equivalents","story":"As a British soldier, there’s no feeling quite like getting one over on the Americans. All that money, all that tech, all that firepower. But battle scenarios – even in training, with simulated casualties and simunition (paintball tip bullets) – require far more than just force. They need tactical intelligence, psychological strength and supreme fitness levels too. The US Marines Corps who were forced to surrender in the Mojave Desert this week, just days into a training exercise against their British equivalents, now know that all too well. The British commandos who “dominated” them into asking for a “reset” halfway into a five-day war fighting exercise, on the other hand, will be elated at having another feather in their famous cap.I started Royal Marines training at Lympstone in 2005, and nine months later earned my green beret. I’d go on to spend almost six years in the Royal Marines, working in Iraq, Somalia, Egypt and Afghanistan. Training exercises with our US counterparts were fairly regular and they generally ended the same way: with the British coming out on top in just about every area. The US Marines contains some outstanding soldiers and some outstanding regiments (ask anybody from the SAS or SBS and they’ll tell you the elite special forces units in the US military are as good as anybody) but, compared like-for-like, the Royal Marines tended to be fitter, more tactically intelligent and, most importantly, able to push themselves far further than their US Marine counterparts. The first time I experienced a US-UK exchange it was our turn to host, so we took them to Scotland for mountain training, which included a trek up Ben Nevis in full kit. Halfway up, we had to start carrying the Americans’ kit – they just couldn’t handle it. In some ways, the US philosophy is: “Why would we need to walk anywhere when we could just get a helicopter or vehicle?” Well, we haven’t got that luxury, so we train for the worst and make sure we can do it without hardware as backup. A couple of weeks later, it was time for the return trip – we knew they’d try to humiliate us by throwing us in at the deep-end, just as we’d done to them. In Virginia, they duly welcomed us by having us attempt their “E” (endurance) course at the hottest point of the day. Two of our boys instantly broke their all-time record. Later that same day, they put us on their “O” (obstacle) course. Again, one of us broke their record. It wasn’t anywhere near as difficult as what we were used to at home.In that same trip we took them on in a battle situation, much like what happened in the Mojave Desert this week, and cleared a “village” in 14 minutes – which was quicker and more efficient than almost any US military force had done it, leading the American commanders to debrief with our commanding officers to find out how we do things so well. The differences, broadly, are psychological. We are taught to think outside of the box and speak up if there’s a better way of doing things they are taught to follow orders and keep quiet. We are taught that the body will do anything the mind tells it they are taught there’s always a vehicle nearby if you need support. We are taught that you need to go to “the dark place” in training to be ready for anything in the real situation they don’t seem to embody this same capability. And we train for 32 weeks they do 13. The result is that the Royal Marines are not just physically ready for anything, but capable of going anywhere mentally, too. We get to a point where things become instinct, knowing what to do without needing to shout an order or stop and think about it. It makes them quick, ruthless and efficient.This week was just a training session. We don’t know exactly what happened out there in the desert. But take away the kit, the tech, the money and there’s no comparison between the US and UK marines. The US learned that again this week – and the British commandos will be revelling in it.As told to Guy KellyMore from NewsVictory for Joe Biden as House passes once-in-a-generation $1.2 trillion infrastructure billPolice should have their phones checked to root out \u0026#39revolting\u0026#39 messages, says watchdogEight officers injured as protesters burn Boris Johnson effigy and launch fireworks at policeHow Oxford University is making the most of a fascist legacyOxford University accused of ‘hypocrisy’ over multi-million-pound Mosley donationThe West is living through a period of radical uncertainty and has no clue how to respondMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"has militant left taken british medical association","story":"It seemed to be a breakthrough. Ten days ago, on the evening of Wednesday October 27, with the Government and GPs locked in a toxic confrontation, representatives from NHS England and the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, held emergency talks. Soon, news began to emerge of a much-needed détente.In fact, it was the beginning of a rollercoaster five days that would see a leading voice of moderation on the doctors’ side dethroned, the union’s radical rump preparing for industrial action and Britain’s primary care system pitched into an extraordinary new crisis.The immediate cause of the fallout could be traced to the middle of last month – when Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced £250million to help GPs through the winter. But the cash came with strings attached, notably that doctors improve the number of patients they see in person which, at 61 per cent of consultations, still stands 20 per cent below pre-pandemic levels (and is a figure inflated by some telephone consultations being classed as “face-to-face”).“League tables” of surgeries seeing the fewest patients in the flesh were to be published, as were the names of those GPs earning more than £150,000. The public was even to be allowed to rate doctors by text.While such moves enforcing the accountability of high earners might have appeared uncontroversial to patients who have struggled ever harder to see their GP, the BMA reacted with fury. It responded with a blow-by-blow rejection of the reforms and, on October 21, a week after they were announced, convened an emergency meeting of its GP committee (GPC). If it was a hardball move to shock Javid and wring more concessions from the Government, it seemed to work, as the two camps met in its wake that Wednesday evening. Sure enough, the GPC soon began to brief details of what seemed like a truce. The league tables would be abandoned. A campaign to address rising levels of abuse directed at GPs was hatched. A BMA spokesperson described the result as “significant concessions” meriting “serious consideration”. The crisis, it seemed, was over.In fact, it was only just beginning. Back within the ranks of the 66-strong GPC, fury was growing among more radical members that the committee leadership had sold out to the Government. According to one source with close knowledge of the matter, a hardcore group of about 12 let it be known that, instead of delivering a truce, they regarded the outcome of the talks as insufficient and grounds for war.The problem was Vautrey. A mild-mannered 57-year-old, who practises at Meanwood Health Centre in Leeds, he had chaired the GPC since 2017 and been part of its executive team since 2004. Yet he was hardly a political firebrand. A gathering of the GPC was called for Saturday, October 30.At first it seemed like little more than a squabble. Vautrey apologised for the emollient tone of his briefings after the talks. But one in the know says that for a fringe minority it wasn’t enough. Members who had been pushing for a harder line with the Government, now began calling for a vote of no-confidence in Vautrey’s leadership: “He was certainly being pushed,” says the source.For Vautrey, the stress of trying to reconcile the in-fighting of the GPC as well as perform his own GP duties and balance family life proved too much. As Saturday became Sunday, he decided that it was time to go. “There’s only so much kind of fighting you can do,” says the source. A BMA spokesman confirmed that he left under his own steam: “There has been no formal application for a vote of no confidence.”For patients, however, the nightmare may only be beginning, as the action mooted in the wake of his departure gathers pace. Physical reminder letters about the ballot have begun arriving in GP surgeries, next weekend the voting closes and, at the end of the week following that, results will be announced – on the same day, ironically, that Vautrey’s successor will be elected.Among those going out of their way to remind GP surgeries about the ballot is the Cambridgeshire LMC, run by chief executive Katie Bramall-Stainer and chair Diana Hunter. “Received your @BMA_GP email re: the indicative ballot?” their LMC tweeted on Tuesday, retweeted by Bramall-Stainer, who added: “Links will be shared on our News tomorrow.”Both women, it turns out, are on the GPC from which Vautrey had just been ousted: Hunter as the regional member from Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire Bramall-Stainer as chair of the UK LMC conference. Sources told The Daily  that Ms Bramall-Stainer, along with Dr Matthew Mayer, her deputy at the UK LMC conference, were known to be frustrated that Dr Vautrey was not taking a strong enough stance with the Government and had been among those driving his expulsion.    LMCs “generally take a more extreme view” than other members, according to one insider. They have, for example, have long been unhappy with the last renegotiation of GPs contracts, in 2019. Led by Vautrey, it unlocked £2.8billion more money. But it also came with the requirement to set up primary care networks (PCNs), which some thought extended government oversight into GPs fiefdoms. “Some people called it a Trojan horse,” says a source. Indeed that winter, at their annual conference, LMC representatives voted to support a motion that they were “disgusted” with the way the new GPs contract had been negotiated, and another saying they had “no faith” in the PCNs. There are even rumours that, frustrated by the “moderation” of the BMA, LMCs may now be considering setting up a rival union. Vautrey himself told The Daily  that, alongside the GPC, “the local medical committee conference at which new policy would be set, provided an opportunity to hand over... responsibility to a new chair.”Regardless of the precise identity of those leading the GPC putsch, however, the BMA – like many trade unions – is open to its agenda being set and its elections dominated by a militant minority.“We need moderate voices in the BMA, those who put patients first, those who remember why they went into medicine, and not extremist militants who want to take on the government,” says Peterborough MP Paul Bristow, member of the health and social care select committee.Unfortunately for those holding similar sentiments, it is election season at the BMA. Campaigning to join its ruling council, held every four years, is effectively already underway, ahead of polls next spring. “It’s very easy to orchestrate a campaign to get certain people, with let’s say Left-wing views, elected, because the turnout in an election for the BMA is about eight or nine per cent of members only,” says someone with experience of such elections. Indeed, she says: “We saw quite a lot of that in the last election.”When it comes to GPs, there is also what the source called “the secret the BMA doesn’t want you to know” – that it represents only “about 45 per cent of GP partners, possibly less”. Industrial action, in other words, can be coordinated by members elected on the turnout of a tiny fraction of a union, which itself represents less than half of doctors.But if they are not all in favour of industrial action, most GPs do have complaint, and not just about face-to-face consultations. Last Monday, as Vautrey was resigning, the BMA slammed the Chancellor for refusing to tweak “punitive” tax arrangements on their pensions. This is because so many doctors accumulate pension pots of more than £1.1million, above which higher taxes kick in. As a result, even as most people foresee working longer, GPs are quitting ever earlier, with the current retirement age below 60.For one GP with more than 20 years’ experience as a GP both inside the NHS and as a private practitioner, such a situation is enraging.Speaking anonymously, he describes a primary care system which has moved from serving patients to serving doctors themselves. The root of this change came in 2004, he says, with the introduction of a new general medical services contract which, critically, included a so-called quality and outcomes framework (QOF) under which surgeries could be paid extra for hitting any of 146 targets – measuring enough patients’ blood pressure, for example, or treating them for asthma. But tickbox treatments, says the GP, meant some doctors started gaming the system. Practice partners were even able to hire locums to see patients while they creamed off the QOF payments. “It created a greedy, greedy society in general practice,” he says.Suddenly, some patients were profitable while some were a burden. “The GPs start negating things that don’t earn them money – if an 85-year-old has an ear plugged with wax, they can’t hear. But it’s not worth it to the GP. You make more money out of chronic kidney disease. It became engineered towards a system that would make the surgery money.”If QOF started the rot, he says, Covid has accelerated it. “Covid has created a convenient alternative agenda,” he says. “It has allowed this diabolical way of practising medicine.” He means patients struggling for appointments and being seen remotely.“Of course it is more convenient for the GPs,” he says. “It’s a nice way to work. But the system has gone drastically awry. You cannot have a picture of a lump and diagnose it.”Now working in private practice, he has a long list of first-hand case studies of patients who have come to him in extremis, having been failed by their NHS GPs.It is as though Covid is the latest battle in a running war that began in 1946 with the creation of the NHS. Then GPs insisted that they remain independent, rather than salaried. For 75 years since, they have cherished their removal from government control. With every intervention that strips away some of that independence, from QOFs to PCNs, GPs wonder what they are getting back. Some fight tooth and nail to retain their independence. Others, with every rule imposed, adopt a work-to-rule mindset.So though it is easy to blame bureaucracy, the stress of the pandemic, underfunding or broken recruitment promises for the militancy of some GPs, the answer may be more prosaic: “Essentially it’s about control,” says the source familiar with the putsch at the GPC. “There are people in high places through all parts of the NHS who would like to see a salaried service.”When the current battle in primary care is seen as this battle for the very soul of the GPs’ identity, it’s easy to see why it is so raw. GPs themselves are not sure which way to tilt – whether they want the freedom yet commitment of yesteryear, or the oversight yet financial rewards of today. Each has its advantages. Within the BMA various camps are mobilising to ensure they are the ones setting the future course. Whoever wins the battle it is unlikely to be patients – some of whom are sure to lose their lives while it is being fought.Back in the Eighties, my average working week would have been considered typical – nine morning and evening surgeries, each of around three hours, in which I would see 30 or so patients. In between there would be letters to write, administrative issues to settle and perhaps a couple of house calls to the housebound and seriously ill. On top of this there was the on-call rota – one night a week and one weekend in four.  I rather enjoyed being on-call, the vicarious interest in seeing patients in their homes, relieving their pain and even, on one memorable occasion, bundling a middle-aged man with crescendo angina into the car and driving at breakneck speed to A\u0026ampE. But over the years things did change. Most patients are entirely reasonable but an increasing minority (or so it seemed) came to regard it as their right to summon a doctor – as in “Get down here doc, my son’s got earache”.Not much could be done about this sense of entitlement until Prime Minister Tony Blair, if inadvertently, initiated a process that would revolutionise the tenor and ethos of general practice. During a television interview in 2000, he made the (unscripted) promise to increase NHS funding by a whopping £12 billion a year. There were no specific plans as to how this financial windfall might be spent but the BMA immediately recognised an opportunity to boost their GP members’ earnings. This was, however, likely to be tricky, for if GPs were to be paid more they would have to do more, while the priority for many was to do less – and shed those (increasingly) irksome on-call, out-of-surgery commitments.Following protracted negotiations they came up with what appeared to be an ingenious solution to squaring this circle. GPs would no longer be responsible, at least nominally, for their patients’ welfare around the clock, 365 days a year. In exchange, they would have to demonstrate their “increased productivity”, specifically a substantial part of their income would be dependent on their success in increasing, for example, the proportion of their patients taking medication to lower their blood pressure or cholesterol levels.It is impossible to convey the complexities of being “paid for performance” in this way but, in essence, the priorities of general practice would shift towards generating the maximum number of “financially rewarded points” reflecting their endeavours in hitting 76 separate targets across 10 medical conditions.  This, “the boldest proposal to improve the quality of general practice anywhere in the world” according to the British Medical Journal, would, it was anticipated, drive up standards. When polled, more than three quarters voted in favour – a sensible decision as it turned out, as under the new system their earnings would rise 40 per cent to £110,000 a year: a tidy sum for a now reasonable working week with no on-call commitments.It has, inevitably, proved to be a Faustian deal, the “soul” of general practice sold in exchange for a technical function. There are, after all, no “financially rewarded points” for being accessible or sympathetic or taking a careful history to diagnose some puzzling condition.  Most GPs, no doubt, are as dedicated and committed as ever despite these new arrangements, which anyhow have had to be modified in recent years. Still, the acrimonious dispute between the Government and BMA necessarily prompts questions as to how and why family doctoring has changed so profoundly over the past 30 years.    James Le Fanu is the author of Too Many Pills (Little, Brown)More from NewsVictory for Joe Biden as House passes once-in-a-generation $1.2 trillion infrastructure billPolice should have their phones checked to root out \u0026#39revolting\u0026#39 messages, says watchdogEight officers injured as protesters burn Boris Johnson effigy and launch fireworks at policeHow Oxford University is making the most of a fascist legacyOxford University accused of ‘hypocrisy’ over multi-million-pound Mosley donationThe West is living through a period of radical uncertainty and has no clue how to respondMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national shortage flu vaccines leaves pharmacies stock","story":"Flu vaccine shortages are causing appointments to be cancelled at the last minute in many parts of the country, The  can reveal. Pharmacists said delays in the delivery of vaccines, combined with the highest uptake of jabs on record, meant some had been out of stock and that appointments had to be cancelled for for some weeks.In other cases, pharmacies have been able to honour existing bookings but unable to open up new slots until supplies are replenished.However, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said there were no national supply issues with flu vaccines and that it was confident of providing what was needed.Last year saw record uptake of flu jabs in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.But pharmacies have already administered more vaccines in the first eight weeks of this year’s rollout than they did for the whole of last winter.Health officials have ordered central contingency stocks of vaccines, which were due to be released to areas in short supply early this month. But those stocks have yet to be released, leaving some pharmacists waiting some weeks before they will be able to top up supplies. This year the NHS has embarked on the biggest flu vaccination drive in its history, with free vaccines offered to more than 35 million people - including all over-50s and millions of younger people with underlying health conditions. The start of the rollout saw significant delays when the UK’s largest supplier of flu jabs, Seqirus, said it had been hit by “unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays”.Ministers said “a border issue” with the company’s Spanish factory had caused the problems. Pharmacists said this delay, which pushed back appointments for several weeks, has had a knock-on effect as record numbers come forward.Many cancellations in the last week relate to jabs for those under the age of 65, where Seqiris is the supplier. Those eligible for NHS vaccines told how they had phoned round several pharmacists and GP practices, only to be told they would have to wait some weeks because of a “national shortage”.Pharmacists said that any shortages were localised and should be resolved within weeks, while urging the Department of Health to release national stocks as soon as possible. Peter Barron, former editor of the Northern Echo, received a text message last weekend to say his flu jab, scheduled in Darlington, had been cancelled due to a shortage of the vaccine for under-65s until mid-November. Others in the North East of England said they had been given less than 24 hours’ notice that their appointment was being cancelled. A spokesman for NHS Tees Valley Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said: Despite all of our GP practices planning well in advance for this year\u0027s flu vaccination programme, many are now being forced to cancel appointments for the winter flu jab due to delays in vaccine delivery from the manufacturer. “This is an issue which is affecting GP surgeries and pharmacies across the whole of the UK.”Alastair Buxton, director of NHS services at the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, said pharmacies were having a “bumper flu vaccination season” with record demand.He said: “Pharmacies and GPs were informed at the start of this season that some deliveries would be made a few weeks later than expected this year, and this has put some pressure on supply. “For pharmacies, problems appear to be localised and temporary – our understanding is that most pharmacies either do have stock, or are expecting further deliveries soon. “However, although stock is still arriving, much of it may already be allocated to people, so those without an appointment booked may need to wait a little while longer to receive their vaccination.“The Department of Health and Social Care have arranged some contingency stocks which should be available this month. We hope they will be able to make these available to pharmacies as soon as possible.”A spokesman for Seqirus said: “There are currently no issues with deliveries or the logistics chain and we have no regional variance to deliveries. “To date, we have delivered 90 per cent of  vaccines. The remainder will be delivered by the end of November.”Stephen Fishwick, from the National Pharmacy Association, said the 3.4 million jabs administered in pharmacies in the first eight weeks of the programme is more than the total they dispensed last winter. He said: “Pharmacies are currently experiencing a high level of demand, which is putting pressure on stock in some places, but most people are currently able to get a jab.“Most pharmacies ordered their stock well ahead of the flu season. However, it often arrives in the pharmacy in batches and sometimes, even when the stock for the whole programme is sufficient supply, can fall behind current demand.”Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Most GP practices have received all their flu vaccine supplies to deliver this year’s programme, and are working hard to vaccinate eligible patients as quickly as possible. “However, a small number will be receiving the rest of their flu vaccines by the end of this month, so if patients are experiencing any disruption, it should be temporary.“GP practices plan meticulously each year to deliver the flu vaccination programme on a mass scale. With over 36 million people eligible for the flu vaccine on the NHS this year, GPs need the supply chain to run like clockwork. “We urge all eligible groups to take up the offer of the vaccine as soon as they are invited.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “There are no national supply issues with flu vaccines. We have been working closely with flu vaccine manufacturers and are confident in their ability to deliver vaccines this season.“Record numbers of people took up the offer of a free flu vaccine last year and the programme is expanding even further this year, with a record 35 million people in England eligible.More from NewsVictory for Joe Biden as House passes once-in-a-generation $1.2 trillion infrastructure billPolice should have their phones checked to root out \u0026#39revolting\u0026#39 messages, says watchdogEight officers injured as protesters burn Boris Johnson effigy and launch fireworks at policeHow Oxford University is making the most of a fascist legacyOxford University accused of ‘hypocrisy’ over multi-million-pound Mosley donationThe West is living through a period of radical uncertainty and has no clue how to respondMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford university making fascist legacy","story":"There is no more poisonous family name in recent British political history. But it has not stopped the University of Oxford grasping with both hands more than £12 million in donations from The Alexander Mosley Trust, a charitable fund primarily established on the back of money inherited from Sir Oswald Mosley, the notorious leader of the British Union of Fascists. The trust was established by Max Mosley in the name of his son Alexander, who died tragically at the age of 39 from an accidental drugs overdose. Max Mosley, who passed away in May at the age of 81 from cancer, was a controversial figure in his own right, acting in 1961 as an election agent for a fascist candidate at a by-election that included publishing a leaflet that warned voters “coloured immigration threatens your children’s health”. On another occasion, he was arrested after throwing punches at anti-fascist protesters during a march in support of his father. For a university that has got itself into knots over its colonial and imperial past - so much so that a statue of Cecil Rhodes sparked an academic boycott - it seems incredible that a £12 million legacy, drawn down from the most reviled British fascist, has barely caused an eyelid to be batted. Welcome to a world in which the University of Oxford, the oldest in the English-speaking world, eats itself up over whether to tear down a historic statue but dismisses any moral or ethical concern over the acceptance of a gift from the Mosley family. In an interview with the BBC in 2017, when asked if the trust’s money came from his father, Max Mosley declared: “Not put together by my father – my father inherited it from his father and from his father. The whole of the middle of Manchester once belonged to the family, that’s why there’s a Mosley Street.”At a university as sensitive as Oxford to the feelings of others - one college removed octopus from its menu so that disadvantaged students at mealtimes felt more “comfortable” and Theresa May’s portrait was taken down from the geography department so as not to antagonise EU students - the Mosley cash has trumped any queasiness.This turning of a blind eye - as one eminent Oxford academic has complained - has caused St Peter’s College to be £5 million wealthier as a result of what it happily calls a “generous gift”. The money is being spent on new student accommodation in the centre of Oxford. Alexander Mosley House, as it was intended to be named, will open its doors to students in the autumn of 2022, although the college has been forced into a rethink on the name. Alexander Mosley had studied at St Peter’s as a maths undergraduate.Although less than 100 years old, St Peter’s occupies a prime spot in Oxford, close to the city’s castle, and its alumni include Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, Geordie Greig, the editor of the Daily Mail, the director Ken Loach, the ex-politan Police Commissioner Paul Condon, and the celebrated chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.Meanwhile the Alexander Mosley Professor of Biophysics Fund, worth a further £6 million, was received “with gratitude” by the university itself. The choice of professor is made by the university’s vice-chancellor in conjunction with the Master of St Peter’s College among others. A second college - Lady Margaret Hall - took £260,000 to pay for disadvantaged students to spend a year at the college. Its Principal was Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of  whose newspaper shared with Max Mosley a common enemy: the newspaper tycoon Rupert Murdoch, more of which later.The payments are detailed in, among other places, the latest accounts of the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, whose chairman of trustees until his death was Max Mosley.Lest anyone forget, Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, was interned along with his wife Diana Mitford during the war for the threat they posed. The couple had married in 1936 in Berlin at the home of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister for propaganda. The guest of honour was Adolf Hitler. Nobody would want to blame Max Mosley for the sins of his father but the man who would go on to run the sport of motor racing had been a keen supporter of his father’s new post-war party, the far-Right Union Movement. Max Mosley had been charged with assault and later acquitted for throwing punches at anti-fascist protesters in east London in 1962, while the year before, having graduated from Oxford University, he was a party election agent responsible for an election leaflet that included the disgusting, racist slur that “coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.” Asked about his leaflet, when it was rediscovered in 2018, Mosley was hardly contrite.He refused to say sorry, finally conceding to Channel 4 News in an excruciating interview: “I think that probably is racist, I will concede that completely,” before adding that he had “no reason to apologise to anyone”.In 2019, a year after Mosley’s car crash interview, the trust was beginning negotiations with St Peter’s College over a possible legacy. Professor Lawrence Goldman, an emeritus fellow and a former editor of the prestigious Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, says he was first made aware of the plans in February this year in a Zoom call with the current master Profesor Judith Buchanan. “The master mentioned that a new building will be named after Alexander Mosley and I was one of the few people old enough to remember we had educated the boy,” he recalled. But the death of Max Mosley in May - and a thorough reading of his obituaries - made him realise he could not sit back in silence. In May, Prof Goldman wrote to Prof Buchanan and again in June, urging her to reconsider.“Max Mosley was a fascist and racist for a significant part of his life when he was in his 20s, after he had graduated from Oxford,” he wrote. “He supported his father’s Union Movement, took part in antisemitic demonstrations, and published material containing the most heinous defamations of black immigrants to this country, and non-whites in general. All this occurred after the Holocaust. “All this was a matter of public record and could have been unearthed by basic historical research.”He warned that to accept the funds was not only “morally insensitive” but also “politically naive”, adding: “Some might call it blood money. Everything about the Mosley family and Mosley name is tainted and the college should have had nothing to do with either.”Prof Goldman, a fellow of St Peter’s College for 24 years, wrote plaintively of his own family’s experience to underline his opposition to the donation. “My story is not uncommon. My grandfather lost two siblings, their spouses, and five nieces and nephews in the Holocaust,” he wrote. His father’s family, moreover, had come from Dalston in east London, where “Oswald and Max Mosley decided to launch their anti-Semitic campaign in 1962, two decades after other families called Goldman were murdered in Poland for the crime of being Jewish”.He went on: “There are, in fact, many people alive today who share a family history like this. And there are many black families also who know and fear the name of Mosley. Twice he wrote to Louise Richardson, Oxford University’s vice-chancellor, pictured below, but received no reply.Exasperated, Prof Goldman wrote an open letter in June to all the governing body fellows of St Peter’s College, appealing to each of them personally to use their vote to stop the donation. “It is unusual to address the fellowship in this way but my attempts to start a dialogue with senior officers of the college have failed,” he wrote to them. “Though you may not realise it, you are each party to a highly ‘unusual’ act: taking funds from the most infamous fascist dynasty in the English-speaking world, the Mosley family.”Accepting the money, he warned, would not only be a “disaster” for the college but also poses a “reputational threat” to Oxford as a whole.In response, he received a formal letter from the college’s governing body, doubling down on their reasons for accepting the funds and warning him that if he made his concerns public he would be in breach of his fellowship. His pleas had fallen on deaf ears.After Oxford and his flirtation with his father’s fascist movement, Max Mosley went on to become president of the FIA, the governing body for Formula One and other motorsports. But it was his bizarre sexual practices, disclosed by the News of the World in an undercover sting operation, that would catapult Mosley into the limelight and make him the darling of wounded celebrities and even leading politicians, among them Tom Watson, once the Labour Party’s deputy leader. In 2008, Mosley, along with the rest of the UK, woke up to the headline “F1 BOSS HAS SICK NAZI ORGY WITH 5 HOOKERS” plastered across the News of the World. Mosley was furious. His sexual predilections were his private business and a court would later uphold that in a ruling that would shape privacy law for years to come. Mosley’s sexual practices were odd - he enjoyed the pretence of having his hair combed for lice in a prison in which the female guards spoke with German accents. But a High Court judge ruled that the sex games had no Nazi connotations and that there was no public interest in reporting them.  When shortly after, the phone-hacking scandal began to envelope the News of the World (the tabloid would shut in 2011), Mosley became a champion of the tabloid’s many victims, financially underwriting the legal costs of claimants bringing phone hacking legal cases against Murdoch’s newspaper empire. Any celebrity or ordinary person, unwilling to risk the expense of suing News International could go to court, knowing that if they lost Max Mosley would foot the bill. By now  newspaper, edited by Rusbridger, scented blood and had begun to go after the Murdoch empire for hacking phones and paying public officials, including police officers, for stories. Rusbridger, 67, left  in 2015 to take up the prestigious post of principal of Lady Margaret Hall, from which he stepped down in September 2021.Max Mosley, through the Alexander Mosley Trust, funded Impress, a state-backed press regulator to the tune of £3.8m. No mainstream media, including  as well as The , has agreed to be regulated by the body, which has been insistent - and the claim tested in court - that Mosely would have no influence on its decision making.Mosley, through his tabloid crusade, made friends in the Labour Party as a result. Watson, Labour’s deputy leader who led the charge in the Commons against the excesses of the Murdoch press, declared: “I’m proud to call Max Mosley a friend and I’m delighted he has made a financial contribution to Labour.” In less than a year between June 2016 and February 2017, Mosley gave £500,000 in political donations to Watson that followed £40,000 to support his successful bid to be deputy leader in 2015.At the same time that Mosley was funding Watson, the family trust set up in his son’s name was making its first donation to Oxford - just over £1.1 million to the St Peter’s College development fund, the payment for which is revealed in the charity’s 2017 accounts. The bigger payment of £5 million for the construction of the new student block followed. For almost a decade, St Peter’s College was presided over by its Master, Mark Damazer, 67, a stalwart of the BBC, whose roles included editor of Newsnight and controller of Radio 4. Damazer stepped down from St Peter’s in 2019 but by then the negotiations for the endowment from the Mosley trust had been agreed and the deal done.Alexander Mosley, pictured below, a student at Westminster School, studied maths at St Peter’s before obtaining a Phd in economics at the University of London. He was a “flawed genius”, according to friends. His body was found at his mews house in Notting Hill, surrounded by drugs paraphernalia, in May 2009. The coroner ruled that Alexander, a long-time heroin addict, had died from cocaine intoxication. He was just 39. His father’s response was to set up the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, whose aim is to “support erse charitable causes”, that also includes training young radio broadcasters in Africa to scientific research into the potential medicinal uses of banned drugs for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The construction of Alexander Mosley House is one of the charity’s biggest funding projects. A decision was taken in secret earlier this year after Prof Goldman raised his complaint to change the name of the new student building so that it will not carry the Mosley family name after all. But St Peter’s remains all too happy to take the money. More from NewsVictory for Joe Biden as House passes once-in-a-generation $1.2 trillion infrastructure billPolice should have their phones checked to root out \u0026#39revolting\u0026#39 messages, says watchdogEight officers injured as protesters burn Boris Johnson effigy and launch fireworks at policeOxford University accused of ‘hypocrisy’ over multi-million-pound Mosley donationThe West is living through a period of radical uncertainty and has no clue how to respondTory chiefs fear anti-sleaze backlash in Owen Paterson by-electionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ready keir smart moneys early general election","story":"“Why not get your shopping for free?” ask Conservative Party leaflets being sent out to activists this month, offering £75 for 75 “lucky donors” to spend at the party’s shop.

Bell, the former BBC war correspondent tells me: “The idea of putting somebody forward in this rock-solid Tory safe seat is worth exploring. I think it is a good idea. It needs somebody outside of politics, preferably with good local connections that the Lib Dems, Labour and Greens could all agree to support.”Bell is even open to lending them his lucky white suit he wore when reporting from war zones. “I am quite happy to be of any assistance that I could but the possibilities are limited at my age,” he says. “If I were 20 years younger, I would do it.

The former Faces lead singer, below, with his wife Penny Lancaster, has bought an apartment in Dublin near the Aviva stadium.“If I get out on my balcony. I’m going to see the (rugby and football) crowds down the street. It’ll be a bit noisy on a Saturday afternoon. The ocean and beaches, it is gorgeous. I’ve been looking for a house there for some time. I love the pubs in Dublin. Love them. So I hope to move in during the next six months.”Stewart also tiptoed into the world of politics expressing sympathy for Boris Johnson (“he’s got a lot on his plate”) and offered some career advice to Michael Gove who took over the new Levelling Up department in September’s reshuffle. “He always moves sideways, doesn’t he? He should be on Strictly Come Dancing. I like him. He’s funny,” he says.Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis dodged a tricky Parliamentary question about how many bedrooms there are in Chequers by instead setting out what Sir Arthur Lee had in mind when he donated the country house to future prime ministers 100 years ago.Sir Arthur recommended two days a week at the 16th century mansion in Buckinghamshire for all future occupants of No 10, according to his detailed wishes set out in the Chequers Act 1917. He wrote: “The better the health of our rulers, the more sanely they will rule and the inducement to spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern hills and woods will, it is hoped, benefit the nation as well as its chosen leaders.”No wonder Boris and Carrie Johnson spend so much time there.Peterborough is edited by Christopher Hope, the \u0027s chief political correspondent and the author of the daily Chopper\u0027s Politics newsletter.

Normally when one is invited for such evenings, the speaker receives little steer about the topics covered. In this case, however, my host proposed a bundle of issues.Brexit, of course, and consequent isions, came first then other causes of ision. In these, the chairman included “climate change and protests, the political ide, the impact of the BBC and its future, the grip of the Left on our universities, wokeness, the whole gender and ersity push, Scottish independence and the Union, the trend for historical revisionism eg Winston Churchill, slavery etc.” You could see where, as they say, he was coming from.“Is traditional Conservatism dead?” he wanted to know, “Our government seems to have no appetite to take concrete steps to roll back this Leftward, woke driven agenda...Our governments have previously worked on the basis that they are there to serve the majority while being mindful of trying also to serve minority interests within that context. Now we seem to have a government that only listens to minorities and those who shout loudest.”And then for good measure, he threw in China as well.It was, of course, impossible for me to do justice to all these themes in one speech. But I was grateful for the way he had linked them, because it got me thinking.My first thought was how hard it is to answer these inquiries, much harder than it used to be.If I had been asked to address a comparable gathering in, say, 1981, I could have given a fairly clear account of how Mrs Thatcher’s Government was trying to change things, economically and in the contest with Soviet Communism. If in 1991, I could probably have made a stab at the benefits of the West’s Cold War victory, while pointing out the accompanying danger, for Britain and the European Community, of creating a single currency, let alone a political union.By November 2001, however, I would have found it more difficult. Did the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon signal a real shift of global power, or were they no more than outbreaks of a fanatical rejection of modernity which could never succeed?By 2011, when the world was still dazed by the credit crunch of 2008-9, had Western civilisation just saved itself from its own excesses or was it merely finding ever more ingenious ways of living on borrowed time and borrowed money? It felt positively rash to come down firmly on either side of the argument.And in 2021? Is my host right? Is there some thread which links the fall-out from Brexit, the rise of wokery, the death of traditional conservatism (with a small or big C), the challenge of China and so on?I don’t really know, which is a bad position for an after-dinner speaker to be in, but not, I hope, a dishonourable one. The world of social media insists on absolute certainty of view, expressed as aggressively as possible. Yet the real world bristles with radical uncertainty more than any period since the 1930s.My embryonic thought is that something in Western political culture has for too long made our leaders look the wrong way. From Tony Blair onwards – through Barack Obama’s “Yes, we can” and David Cameron’s “Let sunshine win the day” to Boris’s merry boosterism – optimism, which is usually a political virtue, has broken away from reality. Victory in the Cold War removed the sense of threat. Globalisation made most goods, for Western consumers, cheaper than ever. The first generation of politicians that could not remember the Second World War thought it was time to come out and play.It rarely is, unfortunately: politics is not a science which “solves” problems and then moves on, but an art which must never stop trying to reconcile the potentially conflicting wishes of millions so that we can live in peace.It is annoying to be told that everything is great when it isn’t, particularly by leaders whose quality of life is better than your own. Although wokery and Brexit are pretty much opposite causes, they have this in common, that they are in revolt against ruling elites. The power of Brexit, which flummoxed all the political parties, though not Boris Johnson himself, is that it achieved constitutional change outside the conventional structures, yet by the legitimate means of democracy. The largest number of British people who ever voted for anything – 17.4 million – did what their leaders told them not to do, and won.So elites find it easier to make concessions to woke movements than they do to Brexiteers. If you tell rich and powerful establishments that they are historically responsible for slavery and “colonialism”, they play along, blaming their dead forebears. But if you complain at, say, the universities’ or the BBC’s overwhelming bias against Brexit you strike much more at the roots of their power than, say, Black Lives Matter does, so they give you short shrift. Elites accord moral deference to woke revolts even when they do not really agree with them (look at their obsequiousness to Greta Thunberg). But even now that Brexit is accomplished, they hold it in contempt.In this uneasy situation, Boris practices his famous “cakeism”. In short bursts of rhetoric, he indicates that he wants nothing to do with insulting Winston Churchill or spitting on our history but he is even more careful to avoid anything that could be twisted to make him look racist or “phobic” of Islam, trans people, gays and so on.Even though he has an enormous parliamentary majority, he lacks underlying confidence. The latest example is this week’s extraordinary back-and-forth about Owen Paterson and the Commons Committee on Standards. Boris knows he rose because of disillusionment with conventional politicians and could just as suddenly fall when the wind changes. He is trying to bestride a political culture which is built on weak foundations.I floated before my dinner audience one thought about what may underlie the insecurity that is felt Left, Right and centre. It is that we now sense – even if we do not explicitly formulate it – that the dominance of the West as a political civilisation and economic entity may really be dying. If it is, that is the end not only of the post-war settlement, but of a phenomenon which has existed since the 18th century.Without that dominance, most of us have no alternative view of the world, so we are confused.China, however, does have an alternative view. It thinks it has proved the West’s decadence, almost surpassed its economic dominance and developed a political system of what we call totalitarianism, but it calls “consultative democracy” far more harmonious than our own fractious cockpit.We plan 2050 as the year of Net Zero. China has chosen the same year as its target for global military superiority. On present showing, China has a greater chance of hitting its chosen target than we do ours. (And one might add that if the West actually does achieve Net Zero by that date – which China has no intention of attempting itself – we will be unable to resist Chinese military might.)Personally, I do not believe that China’s world domination is inevitable, but if we in the West continue to take more trouble to signal our green and woke virtue than counter that threat, it will happen.More from NewsVictory for Joe Biden as House passes once-in-a-generation $1.2 trillion infrastructure billPolice should have their phones checked to root out \u0026#39revolting\u0026#39 messages, says watchdogEight officers injured as protesters burn Boris Johnson effigy and launch fireworks at policeHow Oxford University is making the most of a fascist legacyOxford University accused of ‘hypocrisy’ over multi-million-pound Mosley donationTory chiefs fear anti-sleaze backlash in Owen Paterson by-electionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine booster flu jab","story":"Vaccines QA: Who needs a Covid booster - and are there any side effects It’s important to boost your immunity this winter with both the Covid booster and flu vaccineyou’re eligibleAdvertorialByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov  As Covid cases remain high going into winter, the NHS is inviting people aged  or over and those at risk of serious illness to get a booster vaccination.But there could also be a signicant flu surge this winter – so getting your jab for that is vital too. Last winter, social distancing and limited mixing meant that flu cases were much lower than normal, but dangerous viruses spread quickly when people are all crowded together indoors.So this winter it’s important to boost your immunity with both the Covid booster and flu vaccineyou’re eligible. YOUR VACCINE QUESTIONS ANSWERED Who needs a Covid- vaccination booster All those most likely to become seriously ill from Covid- and those who care for them. But first you need to have had your initial two vaccine doses. The booster will be offered to people aged -plus, those with a health condition that puts them at high risk from Covid, people who live and work in care homes, and frontline and social care workers.If I’m eligible, when can I book my Covid booster The NHS will let eligible people know how to get their booster, which they can have from six months after their second dose. People with certain health conditions may be offered it earlier. Thousands of locations across the country offer a Covid- booster, to give people choice and convenient access. If you are eligible, you will be able to book an appointment at a vaccination centre, designated pharmacy or GP-led service using the NHS Covid- national booking service, or you can go to a walk-in service by using the NHS Grab a Jab walk-in site finder. This is alongside many GP-led services and hospitals inviting people to be vaccinated through their services. I’ve tested positive for Covid-, but can I still get a booster Yes, but you should wait  days before bookingyou’ve had a positive Covid test, starting from the date you had the test.Can I get a flu jab at the same time as my Covid booster You’re likely to be offered them at separate appointments, butyou are offered both, it’s safe to have them at the same time.Who is eligible for the free flu vaccine from the NHS  For a full list of those who can get a free flu vaccination see nhs.uk flujab, but they include people aged -plus, those with certain health conditions, pregnant women and frontline health or social care workers. What about kids  Most primary school pupils and those in secondary school years seven to  will be offered the flu vaccination as a nasal spray. Parents or s will need to give consent for this. Children aged between two and threewill be offered a nasal spray by their GP practice. Those aged six months to two years with a long-term health condition that makes them at higher risk from flu will be offered a vaccine injection.Where can I get a flu vaccine Your GP surgery, a pharmacy offering the service, from your midweyou’re pregnant, or at a hospital appointment. School-age children will be offered the vaccine at school. Those that haven’t started school yet or have a long-term health condition can receive the vaccine from their GP.I never get flu – why do I need a vaccine The flu virus kills almost , people and hospitalises tens of thousands more in England in an average year. It’s more important than ever to get your flu jab this year because more people are likely to get it because we didn’t build up natural immunity during the Covid pandemic. If you get flu and Covid at the same time, you’re more likely to be seriously ill. Also, getting vaccinated against flu and Covid- will provide protection for you and those around you for both these serious illnesses.So why didn’t we see much flu in last winter There are several likely factors, including the measures put in place to stop the spread of Covid-. Last winter also saw record levels of flu vaccine uptake.Will we be more vulnerable to flu this year Dferent strains of flu circulate each year. There may be more strains this year as there were so few flu cases last season. Thus there is less immunity against last year’s strains, and they could continue circulating this year along with the new strains.How effective is the flu vaccine It helps protect against the main types of flu virus. While there’s still a chance you might get flu, it’s likely to be milder. The flu vaccine will also stop you from spreading flu to others.I’m pregnant – is it safe to get the Covid and flu jabs Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it’s important to have botheligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancyyou contract Covid- without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby. If you catch flu when pregnant, you’re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birthweight and may even lead to stillbirth. If you’re pregnant you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service. Are there any side effects Serious side effects are very rare. The nasal vaccine might lead to a runny or blocked nose, headache, tiredness and some loss of appetite. The injection might give you a sore arm at the site of the injection, a low-grade fever and aching muscles for a day or two after the vaccination.“The NHS Covid- vaccine programme, the largest and most successful in NHS history, has protected millions of people and saved around , lives.“Flu and Covid- both cost lives and the increased threat from the two deadly viruses this winter makes it even more important for people to continue sticking to good habits like washing their hands regularly. “Anyone eligible should have their flu vaccine as soon as possible, and their Covid- booster once it has been at least six months since their second vaccine. The vaccines are safe, effective and the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones this winter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boy racing driver posted photo","story":"Boy racing driver posted photo of fatal crash to Snapchat as his victim, , lay dyingLevi Edwards, , and Morgan Sansom, , were involved in a race along Rhigos Road in Hirwaun, Wales in December .

Levi Edwards, , and Morgan Sansom, , were involved in a race along Rhigos Road in Wales when the collision took place on December , . Shirley Hope, , died after a red BMW hit the car she was driving in Hirwaun, near Aberdare.A court heard Sansom drove off before ing and leaving again while Edwards was arrested at the scene by police, Wales Online reports.While emergency services tried to save the womanaposs le, Sansom took a photograph of the smashed-up vehicles and posted the image to Snapchat with the caption aposBad crashapos.  During a sentencing hearing at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, Edwards told police: So I think I’ve come round the corner. I’ve slid, my wheel has hit the kerb. My back end has come out and she’s hit me side-on. I think my back end has come out first. Sansom was arrested at his home and said: I did turn around and come back. He later claimed someone had told him Mrs Hope was still alive so he drove home without giving it another thought. Both defendants pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. Judge Richard Twomlow sentenced Edwards to six years imprisonment and Sansom was jailed for six years and three months. Both were disqualied from driving for six years with Sansom given an extra month.  A statement from Mrs Hopeaposs children said: Our family would like to thank South Wales Police for their hard work in bringing about justice for our mother today. A special thanks to the investigating officers Lee and Guy and our family liaison officer Nerys. The defendants, Levi Edwards and Morgan Sansom, have never shown any remorse for killing our mother. We are satisfied that they will now have plenty of time to reflect on their crimes whilst serving time in prison. In a statement at the time of her death Mrs Hopeaposs family said: We are completely devastated by her loss and she will be sorely missed. We were very close and loved spending time together. Shirley was a loving mother and grandmother and she was extremely proud of her family. She was a much-loved mother to Kevin, Karen, and Martyn and a proud grandmother to nine grandchildren. Shirley was born on December , , in Talgarth, and married Bryan Hope who was a local pharmacist, well-known in Llwydcoed, Aberdare, where she lived most of her married le. Shirley will be sadly missed by her friends and family.  Senior investigating officer detective sergeant Lee Christer said: Cars in the hands of irresponsible and reckless drivers are quite literally lethal weapons as so tragically proved the case on December , .Levi Edwards and Morgan Sansom raced their cars that day with absolutely no regard for the laws of the road or for the safety of other road users. Their decision to use the roads as a racetrack cost a beloved grandmother her le and destroyed the lives of so many others.I would like to pay tribute to Shirley Hope’s family who have shown tremendous strength and dignity during what has been a y and complex investigation.Extensive CCTV inquiries, phone work, and forensic analysis were carried out in this case in order to disprove many of the claims made by the defendants and prove their guilt. That coupled with the impact of Covid- on the judicial process has meant Mrs Hope’s family have waited a long time to see justice served. I hope today’s outcome affords them some comfort as they begin to rebuild their lives.

Billed by director Pablo Larrain as a fable from a true tragedy rather than a biopic, the film centres around three days in the early s when Diana joined the royal family for Christmas at the Queenaposs Sandringham Estate amidst her failing marriage. And controversial scenes show Diana, played by Kristen Stewart, self-harming, struggling with an eating disorder and breaking down in tears in front of her young son Prince William.Some critics have heaped praise on the movie, calling it dizzyingly dark and hailing actress Stewartaposs portrayal of Diana. In fact, Stewart herself has said she and filmmakers were careful when producing the movie. But others have slammed the film calling it cruel and gratuitous with one royal expert saying Princes William and Harry will bevery angry and hurt by the portrayal of their mother.So which parts of the film are rooted in truth and which scenes are fiction  We take a look...

Although no exact dates are attributed to Spencer, the movie is set over three days at Sandringham in  during the Christmas period.And during the film, it shows Prince Charles and Dianaaposs marriage at breaking point, which is true to le.Their relationship had become incredibly strained by this point and it was just months later in  that they announced their intention to separate However, they didnapost orce until , the year before Dianaaposs untimely death in Paris in . Outfit changes  In Spencer, Diana has to undergo several dferent outfit changes a day as she celebrates Christmas at Sandringham with the royal family. And this is in fact a tradition the royal family sticks to during the Christmas break. In her book, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, The Dresser and the Wardrobe, the Queenaposs dressmaker said of Christmas: There may be several outfit changes in one day—it could be as many as five or even up to seven. And itaposs also true, as shown in the movie, Diana did not care for the tradition, according to one royal expert. On the documentary, A Very Royal Christmas: Sandringham Secret, expert and friend of Diana Richard Kay said: “It was one of the unbending rituals that both Princess Diana and the Duchess of York found quite hard to adjust to. However, the outfits in the movie do not exactly match up with what was worn in real-le. Thataposs because the filmaposs costume designer wanted to take inspiration from Dianaaposs outfits, not mimick them. Abandoned house During the film, Dianaaposs character can be seen being increasingly drawn towards the old Spencer family home on the Sandringham estate. It is true that Diana has been born at Park House in Sandringham and had spent some of her childhood there. However, in the movie, it is depicted as being dilapidated and left to wrack and ruin.But according to the Sandringham estate website, the building was gted by the Queen to the Leonard Cheshire charity in  for use as a hotel for those with disabilities - meaning in the early s it would have been in use.Eating disorder  In several eye-opening scenes, Dianaaposs character can be seen struggling with an eating disorder during her stay at Sandringham.And in her bombshell Panorama interview in , the late princess did admit to battling bulimia.She called it her secret disease, revealing she had dealt with it for years without anyone knowing. She added: It was a symptom of what was going on in my marriage. I was crying out for help, but giving the wrong signals, and people were using my bulimia as a coat on a hanger. They decided that was the problem: Diana was unstable. The cause was the situation where my husband and I had to keep everything together because we didnapost want to disappoint the public, and yet obviously there was a lot of anxiety going on within our four walls. Another scene also sees her being weighed on her arrival at Sandringham - seemingly a nod to her struggles. But being weighed at the start of the Sandringham holiday is apparently something the royals actually do.Royal expert Ingrid Seward once told Grazia the Queen ensures that the guests weigh themselves on a pair of antique scales - a tradition that dates back to Edward VII - to make sure guests are well fed. Self-harmIn one of the filmaposs more distressing scenes, Diana can be seen resorting to self-harm. But according to Seward, the late princess was not injuring herself during the time period the movie is meant to be set in. She told the: That Christmas she was there with Fergie, she was pretty miserable and she wasn’t speaking to Charles, but she wasn’t cutting herself at that stage.They’ve piled every bad thing into one weekend which is taking poetic licence a little far. Friendly with staff As her relationship with her husband and other royals reaches breaking point, the film portrays Diana as seeking solace with the staff at Sandringham.And it does appear to be true that Diana enjoyed spending time chatting with those who worked in royal kitchens.Speaking on the documentary Serving the Royals, royal correspondent Robert Jobson said: [Diana] shocked them in a way - when she first came onto the scene - by going into the kitchen, kicking off her shoes, pouring herself a glass of wine, and starting to chat with them while they were preparing the food. “That has been unheard of and in fact, Prince Charles frowned upon it but Diana didn’t care. “She was somebody who was able to mix with anybody - transcend class.For help and support on eating disorders contact Beat Eating Disorders on   .Comment MORE ON Princess DianaRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Doctors at Hull Royal Infirmary diagnosed the youngster with Ewing Sarcoma, a soft tissue cancer which is generally considered one of the top five rarest cancers ever seen.Only  people are diagnosed with Ewingaposs each year in the UK, and it is so rare that any diagnosed case is likely to be the only one ever seen by a doctor in their letime. For weeks, we thought it was a muscle injury, said Cammiaposs mum, Jemma. “Over a space of four days, she was paralysed. The tumour was growing into her spinal cord and into the legs.  “She was diagnosed in June and had her first surgery to remove the spinal cord tumour. Since then, Cammi has now been in and out of hospital for several rounds of chemotherapy at Leeds General Infirmary, meaning she and Jemma are often separated from dad Craig and little sisters Ronnie, five, and four-year-old Rae. She has also been accepted for a course of proton beam therapy at Manchester, which will begin later this month. Jemma, , meanwhile, has put her dreams of studying to work in operating theatres on hold as she travels between Hull and Leeds for Cammiaposs treatment. The mum-of-three added: She’s probably going to be in hospital for her birthday and Christmas. She’s been heartbroken missing out on so much – losing the use of your legs is incredibly traumatic. Jemma said that even after major surgery earlier this week, removing part of the tumour in her lung, she has been up and recovering amazingly. Her bravery and resilience has been outstanding, she said. “She has just had nine cycles of chemo and she’s just tolerated it so, so well. She’s continuously surpassed doctors’ expectations with her recovery.The family have set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money to give the poorly youngster a holiday, and have pledged to donate % of whatever is raised to Leeds charity Candlelighters, which has provided accommodation for Jemma while Cammi is treated.Comment MORE ON Back painCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The monarch is currently taking it easy after cancelling all working visits until mid-November and has been advised to stick to “light, desk-based duties”. Several of her royal engagements have been cancelled and it was revealed that she wonapost be attending the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on November . The Queen, who has recently used a walking stick for the first time on royal visits, is recovering after she had tests and spent a night in hospital last month. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan are living in Calornia with their two children Archie and Lilibet after deciding to quit as senior royals last year. And former royal butler Paul Burrell, who worked for both the Queen and Princess Diana, says Harry and Meghan could have been an incredible help to the Firm at this time.He told Closer magazine : We’ve seen recently that her [the Queenaposs] family have rallied around her to support her and take on more. Kate and William have been thriving – and their work will be a huge support and relief to the Queen. And we’ve seen other members of the family step up to take on more engagements in recent weeks, too. Harry and Meghan’s absence from ‘the firm’ is more signicant than ever.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Their betrayal of the royals is more noticeable now than ever. With everyone stepping up to support the Queen, Harry and Meghan would have been an incredible help, but they’re not – they’re in America. They should be here right now, supporting his elderly grandmother. “I’d find it unfathomablenews of the Queen’s hospital admission wouldn’t have hit Harry and Meghan hard. It must have made them both realise what they’ve done, how far away they are, and the dilemma they are faced with – they are not only denying themselves time with her but denying their children, Archie and Lilibet, time with their great-grandmother.” Despite stepping down from royal duties, Harry and Meghan have continued to make public appearances. In September they held a series of meetings in New York City with the likes of Big Apple mayor Bill de Blasio and visited a school in Harlem.And next week is also shaping up to be a busy one for the Sussexes. On Tuesday, Meghan will speak at an event hosted by the New York Times on economic and professional parity for women. On the same day, Harry will take part in a virtual discussion on tackling the internet lie machine, hosted by Wired magazine. The summit organisers said: The Duke of Sussex joins misinformation experts for a session titled The Internet Lie Machine, which will examine what the real cost of a lie on the internet is – to ourselves, our communities, and our societies. On Wednesday, he will also attend the Salute to Freedom gala to present the inaugural Intrepid Valour Awards to service personnel, veterans and their families. The ceremony takes place at the Intrepid Sea, Air  Space Museum in New York City.

We’re basically brothers.” Have your say on this story in the comment section  Their inspirational journey began last year when Hughie was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. He began three and a half years of treatment and was determined to thank doctors and nurses caring for him at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. He signed up for a fundraising walk but was too ill on the day to join in. It was then that Freddie got involved, going on to complete his running challenge on Christmas Day with Hughie gathering all his strength to join him so they could cross the finish line together.  Freddie laughed: “People do call us the mini Ant and Dec.” And in the first surprise of many, on a day when the youngsters thought they’d been invited to the I’m A Celebrity Jungle Challenge in Manchester as a reward for their hard work, the TV presenters sneaked out of the show’s famous red phone box. Dec said: “What they don’t know, is that we’re here.” Ant added: “And we’ve got a few surprises up our sleeves for so-called ‘Little Ant and Dec’.”  As Hughie and Freddie got stuck in to the jungle challenge, the two stars waited to surprise the pair with news they were to be named Good Morning Britain’s Young Fundraisers of the Year. Ant said: “We know what it’s like when a best mate helps out another best mate.” He and Dec crowned them honorary Princes of the Jungle before challenging them to try out their Geordie accents. Hughie joked: “Aw, what a great day we’ve had, man,” said Hughie.” Freddie added: “Aye, champion”.  Introducing the award at the ceremony in London, Good Morning Britain’s Ben Shephard told the crowd: “This year’s winners are living proof that friendship conquers all.” Ben asked Hughie what it felt like to see their hard work pay off after they raised money for everything from le-saving equipment to fresh fruit and drinks for young cancer patients. The lad, from Higham, Lancs, said: “Just to see what we have done in action.” Asked what kept him running each day, Freddie, from Whalley, Lancs, added: “I knew Hughie was going through a harder time. What I was doing was nowhere near as hard.”  KSI fan Hughie sang one of the star’s hits Holiday, impressing Simon Cowell and Alesha Dixon in the crowd. Hughie was stunned when the rapper sneaked up behind him to present him with his award. KSI said: “I just want to say how proud I am of both of you.” Later Olympian Sir Mo Farah gave a second gong to the pair so they could take one home each. He said. “It’s incredible to see such courage and commitment at that age. And to do it for one of his best friends, there’s no words to really describe it.” Oxford vaxx aces jab fab A standing ovation for the Oxford Vaccine Team went on and on... and on. The scientists stood modestly on stage as they were given a Special Recognition Award. Stephen Fry, who presented it, said: “Their speed and commitment and the midnight oil that was burned. It’s incredible.”  Dr Catherine Green joked the team lived on Mini Cheddars and Bountys during -hour days. She added: “It was lovely to have the recognition of the public.” There ain’t nothing like a Dame for blast amputee From taking part in two Invictus Games and running across America, Mark Ormrod has more than defied the odds as the first triple amputee to survive an IED blast in Afghanistan.Now the former Royal Marine is a Pride of Britain winner after being named ITV ’s Fundraiser of the Year.Mark, , of Plymouth, who has raised more than half a million pounds for veterans charity Reorg, said: “It was a shock, a bit over-whelming, ultimately I’m just proud.”  Mark lost an arm and both legs below the knee in Helmand Province on Christmas Eve . Speaking after he received his award from Dame Joan Collins and Dame Sarah Storey, he said: “Two Dames, two legends, it’s amazing. “I feel like the filling in a very beautul sandwich.” Dame Joan said: “You’re fantastic, inspiring and spectacular.” Comment MORE ON Pride of Britain winnersPride of Britain AwardsITV Pride of Britain AwardsAnthony McPartlinDeclan Donnelly\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Paraskevi, , a university student originally from Athens, Greece, says she and her partner have complained repeatedly about the problems in their home and is pleading for a safer environment to raise her two children in. Clarion is responsible for repair works and Paraskevi said a few months ago handymen cleaned and painted over the black mould in the bathroom but itaposs since grown back at an alarming rate.She told MyLondon : I’m really scared for my youngest, I shower her every day but I’m really worried, after two or three minutes I take her out of the bathroom because I don’t want her breathing it in.I also have to change my face cream and toothbrushes all the time because of the issue - it’s really bad. Black mould is visible in all corners of the familyaposs bedroom and living room, which Paraskevi believes is the cause of her daughteraposs chest infection. While the family sleep at night, their bedroom becomes a playground for mice - closing doors doesnapost stop them from creating havoc in the bedroom. Paraskevi estimates over , mice have been caught inside her home, with up to three a day in traps. She believes sheaposs spent over £ on mousetraps so far and she canapost let her children play on the floor and also feels uncomfortable resting them on her bed.  She added: ‘I’m really worried about putting my kids even on the bed, for my newborn it’s quite risky. But I don’t have any other choice because of the mice. I wouldn’t mind living in this houseI had a better environment - it’s not so much about living in one bedroom, it’s about being in these conditions with my kids, Why does this happen to me  I feel really sad for my kids, they canapost play around. Paraskevi says she wonapost give up the fight for better housing for her and her family. She has written to her MP, Ellie Reeves, about the issues and last month a healthcare worker told Clarion the property is a health risk for her two young children. Paraveski explained: I’m a really hardworking person. I’m trying my best, I’m still in education and going back to work. I’m trying to do everything for my kids to have a better future for us. I donapost want to give up, I will never give up on anything in my le. A Clarion spokesperson told MyLondon: “We are aware of Ms Karagkouni’s current situation and are committed to resolving the mould problem so her family can feel more comfortable in their home.  Following a visit to assess the issue in September, our operatives were due to install a humidistat fan to the bathroom and complete mould treatments. The visit to complete the work was subsequently cancelled at the residents’ request and this has been rescheduled for next week. Our pest control contractor also visited the property in September and the follow up visit has also been rescheduled, at the residents’ request, to a more convenient time.Clarion added: “Ms Karagkouni’s family currently needs a larger home and overcrowding can contribute to increased condensation and mould growth. We will be discussing options for the household to move to a new property that better meets their needs.” Clarion, which manages , properties across the UK and is Europeaposs largest housing association, has come under fire by scores of tenants who claim they are being forced to live in horric conditions. Last week Dawn Page from Merton, south London, said her house became “uninhabitable” due to a sewage leak inside her kitchen and toilet has been forced to spend months in a hotel with her daughter. When the -year-old first reported the leak to Clarion on July , she was told it was fine to continue cooking in her kitchen, where the leak was dripping down onto surfaces and behind cupboards.  It wasnapost until the beginning of August when Dawn forwarded information from Environmental Health to Clarion, confirming it was a serious health risk, that she and her -year-old child were eventually moved into a hotel. Last month The Mirror reported that another tenant who has been living in hotels for three months might not be rehoused until Christmas after being moved out of her damp, mouldy and vermin filled home. Clarion Housing moved care worker Louise Plunkett into a hotel in July after she was hospitalised with breathing problems while living in conditions so bad she had to sleep on her sofa for nine months. The -year-old Mitcham resident had been complaining to Clarion for almost a decade, but was getting nowhere with the housing association.In May -year-old Kwajo Tweneboa, who lives on the Eastfields Estate in Mitcham, spoke about the appalling state he has been forced to live in and said that once workmen told him that not even animals would live in these conditions.He said his dad died of cancer while living at the property and claims the poor conditions contributed to his death.

Louise Chadwick suffered  severe burns on her shins, thighs, legs, feet, arms, hands and lower torso after starting a bonfire in her garden. It took over a year for her burns to heal, but the scars she has will stay with her forever, both physically and mentally. Shortly after the accident Louise was diagnosed with PTSD, which can be triggered by everyday activities including filling the car up with petrol. The horror fire while she was refurbishing her daughteraposs bedroom with her daughteraposs ex-boyfriend, and the two ripped out a wardrobe which later needed disposing of. They decided the best way was to burn it in the back garden using petrol to get the fire going. Louise, , and partner Carl Dover, , had used this method to dispose of old furniture and other waste several times before - but this time he was away with work. So, with the help of Jamie as some extra muscle, they moved the wardrobe into the garden and set it alight. But when Louise went to pour the petrol over the furniture, she didnapost know that Jamie had already got the fire going - and the entire wardrobe burst into flames. The petrol can Louise was holding immediately caught fire and she dropped it on the floor, spilling it all over the grass. Louise then slipped in the puddle of fluid and fell flat on her back, covering herself in petrol as she fell. In a split second, her entire lower body was engulfed in flames and the burning petrol that drenched her clothes was slowly starting to creep up her body.  Louise, from Radclfe, Manchester, said: At first I was in complete shock. Everything happened so fast from the moment I poured the petrol to the horror that came afterwards. My arms went up first, but things really got serious when I slipped and drenched myself in petrol fluid. Thataposs when my pajama bottoms set alight and the flames started to rise up towards my torso. I could feel the heat quickly nearing my face, but I couldnapost get my trousers off because I was wearing my partners slippers. Jamie was trying to help me get them off but he was in complete shock at what was happening. It felt like I was burning for a letime, and I genuinely thought this is how my le is going to end. After five minutes of unimaginable pain, with the help of her youngest daughter Georgia Mulbey, , Louise finally managed to put herself out. Georgia, who was upstairs at the time, came rushing down to the sound of Louiseaposs screams, and filled up several jugs of water to frantically throw over her mother.  Eventually, Louiseaposs clothes were wet enough to extinguish the flames and she was able to briefly escape the torture sheaposd just endured. However, the aftermath of the accident proved equally horric as Louise suddenly realised the severity of her burns. The mum of two suffered third degree burns all over her lower body and arms leaving her in need of a skin graft. She was airlted to hospital as a result of her injuries and spent the next two weeks in intensive care. She also has an extreme phobia of any kind of open flame - making fireworks and bonfire night a terrying occasion.  Every day that goes by I still think about what happened, Louise said. The scars on my body have healed as much as they ever will, but itaposs my mental health thataposs been damaged the most. The first time I went to fill my car up since the accident I started screaming in the middle of the petrol station - in that moment I felt so much fear. Iaposve had countless nightmares where Iaposve woken up thinking I was burning and my kids have had to come in and calm me down. Over the years, I have been terried of bonfire night and fireworks, but I have a grandson now, and I donapost want to miss out on important parts of his childhood. This year, Iaposm going to face my fears head on surrounded by my family, and speaking out about my accident is definitely a way of helping me accept whataposs happened. She said she wanted to speak out about fire safety to warn others about how easily things can go wrong and end in tragedy. Louise pleaded with people to stay safe and not take risks as bonfire night arrives and celebrations begin. I want people to realise the dangers associated with bonfires and how quickly things can go wrong.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

In light of her accident, Louise has retrained as a hair and make-up artist, to help burn victims feel happy with their appearance. She recently gained her industry qualications with the help of her daughters, and canapost wait to see where her new career take her in the future.

Image: Mike Harrington   GettyByTilly Alexander:,  Nov | commentsThe results of our Bonfire Night poll on banning home fireworks are in – and you gave us a decisive verdict.Earlier this week, we asked you and readers of Reach Plc’s other regional and national brands, as well as our sister site TeamDogs, to have your say on whether fireworks should be banned from public sale.With an overwhelming response from over , participants, it’s clear that you feel strongly about the topic. In addition, you also made your feelings about whether fireworks should be allowed to be bought and set off by private persons very clear. Of the , who voiced their opinions, , peoplevoted that fireworks should be banned from public sale. And for many participants, this choice was linked to the impact that the unexpected bangs and flashes, often over multiple days, have on domestic pets. In fact,  per cent added that their dog is afraid of fireworks, with many sharing heart-breaking stories about the impact Bonfire Night festivities have on them.This is Toffee. Toffee is a cheeky ginger cockapoo who is friendly and full of fun - except on Bonfire Night.If you’ve ever had a shaking, terried dog in your arms on Bonfire Night, you’ll know exactly how traumatising fireworks can be.The loud bangs and unexpected flashes are enough to make us scared - let alone our precious pups who don’t understand what’s going on outside. Our sister site TeamDogs - and appeal mascot Toffee - is asking everyone to donate a tin of dog food to a local rescue centre instead of buying fireworks this year. You can find your local centre here and discover more about the #BeMoreToffee appeal here. Or print off and colour in this poster for your window, asking others to support it. One said: “I have a dog who spends the weeks before and after fireworks night quivering with fear. “I think no fireworks should be sold to the public, they are weapons.” Another added: “So many pets are scared stf of them. “My vet has now prescribed diazepam for one of my dogs because she gets in such a state.” A third person also said: “They are terrying to dogs and our Labrador literally shakes and digs at the floor because she is so scared. “She goes in kennels in the middle of nowhere on Bonfire Night and New Year so she is away from them, but we canapost put her in kennels for the full few weeks that people set them off for.” Another recurring reason for banning fireworks included the stressful impact the noise has on inidual who are more vulnerable, such as the elderly. Others also highlighted that they were ‘dangerous in the wrong hands’, and can be ‘misused to terrorise people’, particularly by ‘kids’, ‘teenagers’ or other ‘youths’. One participant added: “Some people with autism and learning disabilities find fireworks frightening due to sensory overload. “Also, for people with dementia and PTSD fireworks can provoke flashbacks.”A second also said: “Too many idiots let off fireworks at random hours with complete disregard for who it affects – other people, domesticated animals, wildle, pollution.”As for solutions to keeping up Bonfire Night celebrations, respondents were more ided, putting forward ious ideas. Some respondents, for example, suggested that standard fireworks should be licenced and only used for public Guy Fawkes Night displays, which would only be on ‘specic firework nights’. Others suggested that even public Bonfire Night celebrations should use low level noise fireworks. And while  per cent of people agreed with low noise fireworks only being sold to the public, some felt that this type should not be available for sale to private iniduals either.Find out more about the TeamDogs fireworks campaign, Toffee’s Appeal , here.Comment MORE ON New YearMental healthFireworksAnimalsDogsTeamDogsBonfire Night\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Inspired by her cartoon hero, who loves making a splash, the three-year-old won over judges with her technique and “infectious giggle”. Grace made a splash with judges of the annual event, organised by Wicksteed Park, Kettering, Northants, which attracted hundreds of online entries from around the world. Competitors taking part in the ninth annual event, held during the October half term holidays, were asked to send in videos of themselves jumping in puddles they’d made or found themselves. They were also invited to use any naturally-formed puddles they found while walking around the Kettering park. Grace, from Northampton, narrowly beat off competition from Jake Watts, , from Desborough, who finished second and Jack Abbott, , from Nuneaton, who was awarded third prize. Judges also gave a Special Achievement Award to Ben King and his son Cassius, four, from Northampton, for their joint entry – Ben holding Cassius in his arms while they jumped. Grace’s prize will include a new pair of wellies and a raincoat donated by clothing and footwear company Joules. Mum, Rachel, said: “Grace is so delighted to have won. She just loves jumping in puddles, and Peppa Pig certainly has a lot to answer for!“Whenever we go out she is always looking for puddles and she makes such big splashes that I often end up getting covered in mud too.” Judges marked entries on things such as the height of the jump, enthusiasm, distance of splash and stickability - the amount of mud which clings to each competitor. Wicksteed Park Head of Sales and Marketing Rachel James said: “We have so much fun with this event each year and judging is very tough, but also hilarious, as we look at all the entries. “As always we had some amazing competitors and the event has certainly been a great way of encouraging people to get out and about in the fresh air and have fun. “One of the things which the judges were looking for was enthusiasm and that, coupled with her infectious giggle and the muddy splat she made were the reasons that Grace just edged first place.” Comment MORE ON Half TermPeppa PigChildrens TV\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dozens of local residents, likely motorists who have driven past the crack, liked the post. The original image was taken in  but it was reposted by the N Action Campaign ahead of a visit from a politician next week. The page shares images of potholes, rips and tears on the road on a regular basis.  Local campaigners spray them with paint to highlight dangers to other motorists. Earlier this year a teacher slammed her local council after a pothole that ripped open two tires on her car was considered not dangerous enough, for her to claim damages. Jeanette East, , incurred £ worth of damage to car when she hit the ft-long, ins-deep crevice in Dedham, Essex. Jeanette, who described the pothole as aposan accident waiting to happenapos, lodged a complaint with Essex County Council following the incident in April, but was sent packing when the damage to the road was deemed not dangerous by an inspector. Now, the disgruntled driver is considering taking the issue before a small claims court.Speaking to Suffolk Live, she said: The unevenness of its surface along thatis lethal for walkers, cyclists and motorcyclists they just won’t see it.Comment MORE ON NHSVehicles\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of Sussex, , will next week be attending a gala onboard a warship in New York to award five war heroes with medals. But despite him twice serving in Afghanistan, he will not be able to wear his military unorm due to him being stripped of his honorary titles.Harry lost his titles after he and Meghan Markle, , announced in March last year they were abandoning their lives as senior royals to shape their own path abroad. They now live in a multi-million dollar mansion in Montecito, in Calorniaaposs Santa Barbara, with their kids Archie and Lilibet. They had first moved to Vancouver Island in Canada.Harry had wanted to retain the honorary positions, including Captain General of the Royal Marines, but was unable to do so.  It means that he will have to wear plain clothes as he hands out awards at The Salute to Freedom gala on November . He will, however, be able to pin his four medals on his suit to mark the special occasion. The event will pay tribute to those who have served in the US forces, defending America, with the awards honouring those who have demonstrated courage and perseverance in the face of great danger or personal struggle. The museum said: The Intrepid Museumaposs Salute to Freedom gala recognises extraordinary leadership and honors the brave men and women who serve in defense of our nation. Rocker and humanitarian Jon Bon Jovi will also receive the  Intrepid Letime Achievement Award for his work as chairman of the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation. The organisation focuses on breaking the cycle of poverty and homelessness through affordable housing and shelter, including permanent supportive housing for veterans. Jon Bon Jovi recorded a charity single, Unbroken, for Harryaposs Invictus Games Foundation early in . Susan Marenoff-Zausner, president of the Intrepid Museum, said: We are extremely proud to bestow the inaugural Intrepid Valour Awards to five incredible iniduals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty and persevered through extraordinary circumstances. It is a core tenet of our institution to be there for our service members and veterans, who are always there for all of us. One of the ways we fulfil this commitment is by offering meaningful programmes that help veterans reintegrate into civilian le and build connection and community, including ones that specically address mental health.We are so grateful to Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex for honouring and amplying the stories of these heroes and helping to raise awareness for mental health support for our men and women in unorm.Comment MORE ON Prince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A study published in the British Journal of Social Psychology named When looking aposhotapos means not feeling cold: Evidence that self-objectication inhibits feelings of being cold claims to have solved the mystery. Roxanne Felig, one of the study authors, revealed on TikTok that when someone is highly focussed on how they appear externally, their everyday needs come second.  She said the study was partly based on Cardi B’s  claim that “a hoe never gets cold,” with Roxanne noting that she and her fellow researchers “wanted to test that scientically”.Roxanne, a social psychology graduate student at the University of South Florida who goes by the username @ naia_papaia on TikTok, said: So basically, it seems like what Cardi was saying was that she was too focussed on how she looked and what she was wearing to feel cold. And this actually aligns perfectly with the main theoretical perspective that I used to conduct my research, which is objectication theory. When women are in a state of objectication, they are less aware of how hungry they are, their heartbeat. They are just less able to recognise their internal states. The research team interviewed women who were queuing to get into clubs over five particularly cold nights in Florida - where temperatures ied between °C and °C.  Participants were then asked how much they typically think on a day-to-day basis about how they look, how many drinks theyaposd had and how cold they felt. The researchers also took anonymous photos of the outfits worn by the women, which were then coded for amount of skin exposure. We found that for women [who ranked] high in self-objectication - regardless of how much skin they have exposed - they wouldnapost feel cold, Roxanne explained. The study concluded: Our hypothesis was supported: women low in self‐objectication showed a positive, intuitive, relationship between skin exposure and perceptions of coldness, but women more highly focused on their appearance did not feel colder when wearing less clothing.

But I reckon I could cut through the bureaucratic nonsense and give them all a telling. If I was invited to their fancy get-together I’d call all the leaders “babes” so there were no diplomatic incidents. I’d point my walking stick at Boris Johnson and say: “Excuse me babes. Put a mask onyou’re sitting next to Sir David Attenborough or anyone  for that matter. “You’ve been in intensive care with Covid and preaching to the country to wear a mask, now wear one yourself.”Before I took the mic I’d arrange bagpipers to march through the room to make sure everyone was awakeand paying attention.And I’d start my speech by explaining how people of a certain age might not understand all the carbon this and emissions that.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section But we know how to live a le that’s kinder to our environment because we were brought up that way. Anyone whose parents lived through the war instinctively knows never to waste or throw out food. My mum made leftover meat, always bought from the local butcher, into mince by squeezing it through a mincer attached to the table. She made leftover veg into bubble and squeak, which tasted like a treat and not scraps. Andthere were a couple of slices of stale bread she’d transform them into bread and butter pudding. We didn’t have exotic fruit and weird veg flown from Brazil and wrapped in plastic. We had apples from the nearest orchard, mint, rhubarb and peas from dad’s vegetable patch .  Potatoes and cabbage came from the allotment, milk was collected in a churn from the local farmer. We had what posh people now call an organic diet without realising. Hand-knitted jumpers and not central heating warmed us at home and we kept cosy in bed thanks to extra blankets and a hot water bottle. We even recycled our bathwater by ensuring a whole family washed in one tub. Our streets weren’t littered with takeaway wrappers because we didn’t have any. Instead, food on the go was homemade sandwiches wrapped in greaseproof paper and a rinsed-out and refilled bottle of water. Our roads were quiet because we walked or cycled. Our skies were clearer because we took holidays by bus, not plane. I would swap all of today’s technology for that old le, when few of us had phones at home but we all stopped to speak in the street. We had no time-saving gadgets but time for each other. We had no need for hi-tech doorbell cameras because we all kept our doors open. Everything’s go-go-go now and everyone’s under so much pressure they take tablets like pear drops. We can make the Earth a healthier place by slowing down. We don’t need world leaders lecturing us at COP. Just remember the important lessons and simple way of le our parents and grandparents taught us. We owe it to our grandchildren.It’s easy to lose snooze controlWatching the goings on at COP has been an eye-opener, but not for American President Joe Biden. Looks like he fell asleep during a speech. I understand the importance of the big conference, but I felt for him. Because when your eyes go, you’re gone. He’d just flown from America to Italy and then Glasgow so must’ve been jet lagged. And he’s no spring chicken. Haven’t we all fallen asleep when we really should be paying attention  I know I have. Years back our Robert treated me and his we Sarah’s mum to tickets to watch a tennis match at Wimbledon.  I’m the biggest Wimbledon fan and was up with the larks at am to be on time. Once there, I was so excited my eyes were out on stalks and I wanted to do and see everything. I bought so many souvenirs I’d no money for strawberries and cream so ate an apple instead. But with all the excitement, and the warm sun on my face, I fell asleep while watching the match. Sarah’s mum gently woke me when she saw my head rested on the shoulder of the man sitting next to me. I was mortied. I could blame a boring match. But I was there to see Serena Williams. So I feel for you, Joe.I’ll have my cake and eat it too...This week Sheila made me a whole lime and coconut cake and told me to cut it into thin slices to make it last. It did last: two days.Cleo’s rescue gave me goosebumpsWasn’t it wonderful to see footage of little Australian girl Cleo Smith being rescued.  Looking at her face, hearing how hardened detectives cried when they found her and imagining her parents’ joy made goosebumps rise on my arms and tears fall down my cheeks.Cooked with a gravy kind of loveRestaurant dishes can be as fancy as you like, but they’ll never beat meals home made with care by friends. Janet invited me for Sunday lunch, and it was to die for. Baked Camembert with cranberry sauce and toast soldiers was so tasty I could have eaten six of them. The leg of lamb with mint sauce was delicious. But the gravy, made from meat juices with bits in where the roast potatoes had stuck on the roasting tray, was the best.  No one can make gravy like my mum, but Janet came a very close second. After I’d scooped the last drop out of the gravy boat with a spoon, Janet confessed she’d been hoping to save the gravy for her lunch the next day but was too polite to say. I might never be invited again.Revitalising RyanFilm star Ryan Reynolds’ visit to Wrexham made everyone here feel excited. He is taking the role of revitalising our football team very seriously but said he needs to learn the offside rule. I’m a huge football fan but even I don’t understand offside.  Mind you, I know more than our Robert’s we Sarah. When I asked her who’d scored for Leicester, she said: “A player called OG.”If you would like to contact Val, please email features@mirror. co.uk or write to Val Savage, PO Box , E DD The Mirror makes a donation to the Alzheimer’s Society in lieu of payment. alzheimers.org.ukComment MORE ON FoodLoveClimate changeMental healthAlzheimers diseasePoliticsCOP\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Heres how to spot the beautul aurora borealisThe Northern lights as seen over Belhaven bridge in Dunbar, Scotland overnight Image: PAByHarry Thompson:,  Nov | comments The Northern Lights will be visible across the UK tonight thanks to a new solar flare, experts have predicted. Wednesday nightaposs aurora borealis show was visible across much of the south of England due to a phenomenon called coronal mass ejection, caused by huge globs of gas and magnetic field being fired out by the sun.The flares collide with earth and cause a massive geomagnetic storm. It is now thought more flares are on their way with light shows set to continue into tonight.The Met Office aposs Krista Hammond said: As was predicted by the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre, a coronal mass ejection impacted with the Earth yesterday.“The resulting strong geomagnetic storm meant the Northern Lights were visible across large areas of the UK overnight last night. “We’ve had reports that the aurora could even be seen in some central areas of the UK, which is possible when a storm of this magnitude impacts the Earth.  “This means there is the potential for further sightings of the Northern Lights overnight, although there will be spells of patchy cloud over Scotland which could limit visibility in places.” It is thought the coronal mass ejection left the sun on Tuesday morning and reached earth by the following evening. Where can I see the Northern Lights tonight  Unlike previous opportunities to see the Northern Lights, this weekaposs displays have been visible further south, with people in Devon thought to have a chance of spotting them tonight. As ever though, the best opportunities will be further north, with the Lake District, Scotland, Midlands, Norfolk and North Wales likely to be the safest bets. It is understood that more space weather events are expected over the next four years, into around . Ms Hammon said: This increase in activity is expected as part of this cycle, and we can expect an increase in the number of space weather events as we move towards the next solar maximum. Tips for seeing the lights You need a clear night with as little cloud cover as possible and make sure you get as far away from light pollution as possible. Once youaposve found your spot, look towards the northern horizon and remember that the magnetic activity can have an impact on GPS sources. The issues huge solar flares could potentially cause havoc due to their strong magnetic field. Met office forecasters have said it is possible that: Intermittent GNSS satellite navigation and low-frequency radio navigation problems may occur, HF radio may be intermittent. The storm is regarded as aposcannibalapos because it moved so fast it caught up other solar flares and absorbed them.

Motorists caught in the jam were not happy about the delay after the electric-powered car blocked the multi-storey when it lost power on the ramp. Reddit user Henry was among those who took to the social-networking forum to show their anger at the wait he and other motorists experienced. Other users were also outraged and said there was no excuse for causing such a long delay. After being caught in the jam on Wednesday, Henry posted pictures about the y wait. MyLondon reported his frustration, he said: Perfect, a Tesla ran out of battery and stopped at the ramp of a  storey car park at Westfield. It has been three hours and counting. One of the images he shared with the post showed a tailback of cars looping around the sloped spiral exit ramp. The next, though slightly motion blurred, showed the apparently stricken black Tesla Model S pulled over to the side of the ramp, though still without enough room to pass. According to Tesla, the car has  miles of range when fully charged, so itaposs tough to run out without reaching a charging point. This was exactly the point other users on the forum were making following the delay at Westfieldaposs car park Considering the huge range these cars have, there’s really no excuse for this. One wrote Especially as the cars still have quite a bit of rangeeven after hitting %. The driver had plenty of warning. Another agreed.  Westfield even has a large capacity tesla charging station lol. But yeah like others say over  hours is bad management imo. Get an extension lead at that point. A standard wall plug adds - miles an hour. So just  mins to give it a full mile to drive to a parking spot is needed. Others were less damning of the driver, one writing: Same for running out of petrol I guess. It happens. When users suggested the car should have been recovered already, original poster Henry wrote: The Tesla is completely dead and it is in parking mode. The management team rumbling about their solution and basically there is nothing they can do. At the end, all the car reversed out from a  story winding ramp. Fab day. He also added that attempts to tow the car out had failed. A spokesperson for Westfield said: A customer’s Tesla vehicle broke down on the entry ramp of the car park at around pm due to an empty battery. Westfield London’s car park team assisted the broken down vehicle and guided  vehicles that were behind the Tesla around it.

Photographs show the streets lined with crowds of people holding placards demanding change for the future, with participants marching from Kelvingrove Park to George Square. Campaigner Greta Thunberg, fellow activist Vanessa Nakate and other young campaigners, as well as local trade unionists, will speak to crowds at the end of the march through the city where the UN summit is being held. The climate strike has been organised by Fridays for Future Scotland who said they were demanding climate justice and seeking to hold global leaders to account. It comes as the Cop talks feature events highlighting the voice of young people and education in climate action.  At least , people are expected to take part in the march. Ms Thunberg has been highly critical of the two-week conference, claiming it is the most excluding Cop ever and labelling it a two-week celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah. Charlie OaposRourke, , from Glasgow, skipped school to attend the march with his mother Cairsty OaposRourke and sister Edith. He said global leaders at Cop must listen to the people.  He told the PA news agency: Listen to what they want to say. Donapost just go for profit. Listen to what the planet needs. His mother Cairsty said she was there for her children and for the generations to come to just show that something has to happen and it has to happen very quickly.Ms OaposRourke, who is from Glasgow and works for the NHS, said the Scottish Government has been on the fence for too long on the issue of the Cambo oilfield.She added: Iaposd like to hear Nicola Sturgeon saying a bit more against it. Iaposd like all of this funding to go into a way out of this, a way out of using fossil fuels.  Finlay Pringle, , from Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands, travelled by train to Glasgow with his father to take part in the march. He said: If you really, truly love something and you want to protect it, no matter what it is, it doesnapost have to be climate striking, butthereaposs something that you love and you want to protect it, then you should do that, donapost think twice about it. People of all ages have joined the youth-focused protest.  Among them are a group of mothers from around the world, including Rosamund Adoo Kissi Debrah, whose daughter Ella died from an asthma attack as a result of severe air pollution. The group will also be handing in a letter at Cop calling for an end to new fossil fuel financing for the sake of their childrenaposs health and future. The world is at a long-awaited political tipping point in the fight against climate change, former US vice-president Al Gore has said, as he praised youth climate strikers in Glasgow.  Mr Gore, who served two terms as vice-president under Bill Clinton, added that impressive pledges for action have been made at the cityaposs Cop summit in Glasgow. But he warned the climate crisis is getting worse faster than we are yet implementing solutions, as he said more political will is needed to tackle the problem. Speaking at the summit, he said: Young people all around the world are telling us now is the time. In every nation Fridays for Future...outside this meeting hall today.  This is a massive demand by the young people of the world and donapost tell them itaposs impossible. It is possible. We have the tools and we have the ability to this. COP President Alok Sharma said: “Wherever I have been in the world, I have been struck by the passion and the commitment of young people to climate action.The voices of young people must be heard and reflected in these negotiations here at COP. The actions and scrutiny of young people are key to us keeping . alive and creating a net-zero future.  “I am also aware of the fear and anxiety many of them feel about the future of the planet, including my own children. That is why we must act on the COY Global Youth Position Statement from COY and the manesto from the Milan YouthClimate Summit.” YOUNGO Global Focal Points, Heeta Lakhani and Marie-Claire Graf said: “YOUNGO has been working closely with the U.K. Presidency and the UNFCCC Secretariat to co-design Youth and Public Empowerment Day.We successfully profiled global youth voices through the COY Global Youth Statement, and brought together four generations to share best practice examples of achieving climate justice collectively.”  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Fridayaposs protest comes ahead of marches on Saturday where tens of thousands of people are again expected in Glasgow, with other marches in London and cities around the UK, as well as across the world.

His thick locks has given him an uncanny resemblance to the prime ministeraposs own messy hair and led to strangers pointing out the similarity. Chester’s mother, Amy said she could not imagine her son with a dferent hairstyle and it matches his free-spirited, free-loving personality, much like the prime minister. The -year-old said: Chesteraposs hair really started kicking in when he was about four months old when we were in the first lockdown.  I obviously couldnapost take him to the hairdressers for a little trim and I definitely wasnapost going to be taking a pair of scissors to my babyaposs hair so we just let it go. And it just kept growing and growing, but I think it really suits him. People have compared his hair to resembling Boris Johnsonaposs which is hilarious. I think it is the bright blonde colour and thethat make people think that. Heaposs like a little surfer dude. Due to the lockdown, Chester’s hair grew long and thick and Amy did not have the chance to cut it and since fell in love with the style. Chester’s dad, Kieran, , wasn’t as sure on the style at first Amy said, but it has grown on him as well. She added how she often gave him a little top knot now. Even when the country unlocked and she could take her son back to the hairdressers once again, Amy had fallen so in love with the haircut she couldn’t bring herself to have it cut. She added: When we were able to go to the hairdressers we had it trimmed around his face and into more of a little style which I think is adorable. Heaposs got such amazingly thick hair for a little child. I can even plait the top of ithe sits still for long enough. His older brother, Clark, age five, has more golden blonde coloured hair, whereas Chesteraposs is bright blonde, and Clarkaposs is shorter too. His hair never grew as fast as Chesteraposs does. As well as earning comparisons to the prime minister, Amy said Chester is often thought to be a girl because of his hair. Amy says that Chester is also sometimes confused as being a girl because of his hair. She said: I am excited to see where Chesteraposs hair goes. Iaposm happy to leave it growing at the moment and see how it ends up. I love his unique hair and we will keep it like this until he decides he would like to have a haircut.

Their victim, Sohail Ali, , was lured to Summerfield Park in Birmingham by the promise of meeting a girl on December  last year. He had been speaking with Tariq online before agreeing to meet with the girl in the park at .pm. Mansha, who was armed with a kne and a blank firing gun, lay in wait with Ar before ambushing Mr Ali who was stabbed seven times as well as being shot.  He was attacked with such force the kne snapped and part of the blade was found embedded in his chest. Mr Ali was rushed to hospital for treatment but died just after midnight. CCTV shows Mansha and Ar fist-bumping each other as they calmly walked away from the murder scene.  They were arrested days later when detectives discovered messages on their phones discussing the attack.The killers were in regular contact with each other days before the murder and Tariq messaged Mr Ali on WhatsApp and Instagram just  minutes before the attack.Following a trial at Coventry Crown Court, Mansha, of Edgbaston, and Tariq, of Walsall, were both found guilty of murder. Mansha, who was also found guilty of possession of a bladed article, was jailed for  years while Tariq was ordered to serve at least nine years before being considered for parole. A third defendant, Daiyan Ar, , of Brandhall, Warley, who was convicted of manslaughter, was jailed for three-and-a-half years. Detective Inspector Laura Harrison, from the homicide team at West Midlands Police, said: This case is really sad. It was a completely senseless attack that took a le and changed three more forever. My officers have worked tirelessly on the case and although todayaposs verdict can never bring Sohail back, I am pleased that we have been able to secure justice for him and his family.  My thoughts are with them at this time. Following the sentencing Mr Aliaposs grieving family said: We are pleased that the defendants were found guilty and sentenced today for the brutal crime they committed. Sadly nothing can bring Sohail back to us. Sohail was murdered needlessly and his le has been stolen from him. The pain that we suffer from his loss is overwhelming. He will forever remain in our hearts.

But was it an accident, suicide, or something more sinister Tycoon Robert Maxwel with his yacht in the background Image: DAILY MIRRORByJohn Jackson, Ex-Mirror reporter who travelled with the Maxwell family to scene of tragedy:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsItaposs  years since Robert Maxwell’s naked body was found in the sea off the Canary Islands, his death a mystery which endures to this day. The media mogul, whose company owned the Daily Mirror, had been reported missing by the crew of his luxury yacht hours before the discovery. But Maxwell, a larger-than-le and celebrated figure, soon went from hero to villain as it was found that he had looted millions from the Mirror pension fund to prop up his debt-ridden business empire. His treachery condemned many of his workers to poverty and left his newspapers on the verge of collapse. With the Spanish authorities ruling out foul play and the family insisting he would never take his own le, conspiracy theories abound to this day. Here, former Daily Mirror reporter John Jackson recalls being at the centre of the storm which gripped the world...  Within hours of arriving for work on Tuesday, November , , editor Richard Stott relayed the astonishing news that publisher Robert Maxwell had been lost overboard from his yacht Lady Ghislaine and I was on my way to find him and support family members. With Bonfire Night plans scrapped, photographer Ken Lennox and I took the lt to the roof of the building next to the Mirror, then at London’s Holborn Circus. Maxwell had bought the site to provide himself with a luxury office and helicopter pad. His copter landed and on board were his we Betty, dressed completely in black, and Philip, the eldest of the Maxwell’s remaining seven children . Nothing was said as we hovered over Fleet Street and headed to Farnborough Airport in Hampshire where we boarded one of the family’s Gulfstream jets for the flight to the Canaries. Around an hour later a message was relayed to the pilot that a body had been found in the sea and we were erted to a military base near Las Palmas. At that moment Betty told me: “Whatever has happened, I can assure you he did not kill himself. He would never do that.” We taxied up to the hangar where the body was waiting in the air-sea rescue helicopter. A request for -year-old Betty to climb aboard and make an identication was instantly rebuffed. She told them to bring the body into a nearby room. As this was being arranged – with dficulty as Maxwell was very overweight – the rescue pilot told Betty and me: “I have plucked many bodies from the sea and I just want to tell you he did not drown. There was no water in his lungs.” I then escorted Betty and Philip to view the body of my boss. His skin hadn’t discoloured or wrinkled but what intrigued me was that he was lying with his arms up either side of his head and his hands were clenched.  As a father of four it reminded me of how babies often fall asleep. It was certainly Robert Maxwell. Betty relayed this to editor Stott and the front page headline next morning was “The Man Who Saved The Mirror”. Little did we know of the revelations to follow... From the airport we were driven to board the Lady Ghislaine and start three hectic days with only one thought dominating Betty’s mind. She was determined to get the body released so we could fly it to Jerusalem and arrive before sunset on Friday. Jewish tradition dictates a body must be buried as soon as possible. But we would not be able to land on the Sabbath – Saturday, meaning the burial would be delayed until Sunday, five days after her husband’s death. The next day youngest daughter Ghislaine flew in from New York. At this point I should say I never saw one tear in the eye of we or daughter. Betty admitted the marriage had been falling apart for years and although Ghislaine was her father’s favourite, she remembered the cruel way he often treated the children. Condolences came in non-stop and I took calls from Margaret Thatcher and President George Bush. Philip askedwe could have a quiet word. Tearfully, he said his father hated him and the feeling was mutual. Unlike brothers Ian and Kevin, Philip had no interest in finance and the family business. His sadness was: “Now I will never have the chance to make up with him.” One major obstacle to the Israel journey was that Maxwell’s -stone body in its zinc-lined coffin was far too heavy for the Gulfstream jet. In the end a larger plane was chartered and we all set off early on Friday, arriving just before dusk. In the darkness I could see Betty having a quiet sob, the first sign of a widow in mourning. Two memories of our leaving the Lady Ghislaine for the last time: Betty askedI would carry her handbag, which prompted much mirth from mates ashore.  Not until I read her memoirs years later did I learn that the bag held £, in cash and other treasured items. As we were heading for the gangplank Betty shouted that I should tell Ghislaine to hurry up. I found her in the lounge, instruc­­ting the crew to shred all documents on board. Did she know something  In Jerusalem the family stayed at the historic King David Hotel where they were joined by the remaining children. The Israeli Government afforded Maxwell an elaborate funeral with Philip giving the family eulogy after a speech from the Israeli President. And then he was laid to rest in a plot he had bought on the Mount of Olives and my job was finished. Now the questions – was it suicide, assassination or natural causes  I, one of few people who saw him dead and alive, and spent time on the yacht, am convinced it was natural causes. It is known that at around am on the final morning he telephoned the bridge to complain his cabin was either too hot or too cold. Then he went on deck, naked, to pee over the side. The yacht has a steel barrier around its entirety except by the tenders at the stern where there are two chains. He made his way behind the tenders and then one of two things happened. It is known that he was a very sick man and there is one possibility that he had a heart attack, grabbed the chain, couldn’t hold on and was dead when he hit the water. Or, and we know it was a windy night and the yacht was rolling, he stumbled, grabbed the chain, couldn’t hold on and had a heart attack as he hit the very cold ocean. That would explain three things: the way I saw the body with arms up and hands clenched the rescue pilot’s assertion there was no water in his lungs and Betty’s absolute assurance after  years living with the man, that he would never have killed himself. Back in London, Ghislaine thanked me for all I had done for the family during the fraught and dramatic days after her father’s death. Like all the family, she seemed diminished in her grief. Now, as she sits in a New York jail awaiting trial for her association with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, I realise that for her that dark day  years ago was just a portent of even darker days to come.

Gunpowder, treason and plot! Every year the th of November  is indeed remembered, the day a disgruntled man tried to blow up King James I in the Houses of Parliament.His name was Guy Fawkes and was part of a group of Catholic plotters that have been memorialised into British legend ever since. Fawkes has become the face of Bonfire Night every year where effigies are often burnt and fireworks up and down the country are joyfully set off.The plotter has become a major part of British popular culture, the vigilante hero in the  film V for Vendetta even wore the face of Guy Fawkes as a mask So who was Guy Fawkes  Who was Guy Fawkes   Fawkes was born in  in York as a Protestant, but became a staunch Roman Catholic. Being a Catholic in th century England was dficult at that time and they were often persecuted for their beliefs after Henry VIII set the reformation of the church in England in motion. The Stuart king, James I, was Protestant and was expected to become a fair ruler for Catholics and Protestants alike, but he was under fierce pressure in Parliament to resist and impose laws of persecution on Catholics once again. Upon taking the throne, James I introduced fines for Catholics. The likes of Fawkes left England to fight for Catholic Spain against the Protestant Dutch. He adopted the Italian iant of his name aposGuidoapos in order to appear closer to his Catholic faith. He eventually signed his confession as aposGuido Fawkesapos. It is believed that plotters needed Fawkes as his time abroad would make him more unrecognisable as conspirator and harder for the authorities to track. Military experience also helped. The Gunpowder Plot  The plot to assassinate the king and replace him with a Catholic ruler was instigated by plotter Robert Catesby, who was one of the main conspirators alongside Fawkes, Thomas Winter, Thomas Percy, John Wright and Robert Keyes. Seven other accomplices are also known about. The plan was to raze Parliament to the ground and blow up the king at the state opening of Parliament, but an anonymous letter was sent Lord Monteagle, a Catholic, warning him not to attend. The authorities were soon notied and Fawkes was discovered with  barrels of gunpowder in a cellar underneath Parliament on the night of the th to the th of November. When found, he is known to have said that he planned to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains, a reference to James I, who was Scottish. Fawkes was then tortured and gave up the names of his fellow conspirators. The plan was for him to be hung, drawn and quartered, but Fawkes jumped to his death in January . In the aftermath, an act was passed to appoint  November as a day of thanksgiving for aposthe joyful day of deliveranceapos. It meant that the plot was remembered each year officially until , but the custom had become popular and we still celebrate it to this day. As is tradition at the state opening of Parliament, the Houses of Parliament are still searched by the Yeomen of the Guard to make sure there is know Fawkes-wannabe lurking in the chambers below.

The billionaire Amazon founder - who recently flew to space in his Blue Origin rocket - has recently snapped up a massive estate on the Hawaiian Island of Maui, in the US.The lavish property boasts its own private bay, set on  acres of land on a paradise island. Bezos, the world’s second richest man, estimated to be worth about £billion - is also reportedly looking into buying more property on Maui.Bezos was recently blasted as an aposeco-hypocriteapos for flying to the COP climate summit on a carbon-pumping private jet.And a climate expert is now claiming the “only reason Jeff Bezos cares” about climate change is because he has bought a property in Maui, Hawaii which could be affected by accelerating sea level rises. Prof Mark Maslin, leading climate scientist from University College London, and author of aposHow to Save Our Planetapos, said: There is something distasteful about a billionaire flying into COP on his private jet to tell the world they must stop climate change. I say letaposs save the planet for the . billion normal people that live on Earth, not the super-rich who could put their money where their mouth is, but do not. Property records reportedly show Bezos purchased three dferent structures on his own private bay, plus extra acerage, under Lochland Holdings LLC. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly owns more than , acres of land on nearby island Kauai, where heaposs said to have splurged £million on real estate works. On its website, Hawaii State warns: Chronic flooding will lead to an additional , acres of land becoming unusable, and , structures are projected to be at risk due to sea level rise. |About  cultural sites,  miles of major roads, and at least  billion in assets will be vulnerable to chronic flooding. Such widespread flooding could change the character of the islands by affecting cultural heritage, tourism, agriculture, and ecosystems. It adds: Thirteen miles of beaches around the state are already gone, including  per cent of Oaposahuaposs beaches because of coastal erosion.  Seventy per cent of beaches around the state are currently threatened. Prof Maslinaposs stark climate change warning came after the Amazon billionaire pledged £.billion to the Bezos Earth Fund to help restore nature in a COP speech on Tuesday. Bezos, , sparked mockery by saying a recent voyage to space on his high-polluting Blue Origin rocket made him realise how fragile Earth is. He is estimated to have splurged £billion on his private space firm Blue Origin. A spokesperson for the Bezos Earth Fund told The Independent: Jeff uses sustainable aviation fuel, and offsets all carbon emissions from his flights. Meanwhile, Amazon says it is on course to power its operations with  per cent renewable energy by . It has also pledged to reach net zero carbon emission by . However, Amazonaposs absolute carbon emissions reportedly grew  per cent year-over-year in  due to a pandemic online shopping boom. It also reportedly employs , drivers, with , trucks, , vans, and a fleet of jets all pumping out emissions.

But that wasn’t the case for this Yorkshire Terrier, who definitely seemed to be enjoying the experience of having their fur cut at home in a TikTok video thataposs been making dog lovers giggle.TikTok user @lrfearn posted the hilarious clip, which shows the Yorkie bouncing on their back legs as they get their back fur clipped.The clip is appropriately captioned “Thataposs the spot!”. The pup vibrates so much that they scoot across the floor and the groomer has to keep pulling them back into place. At one point in the video a Staffie comes in and gives the Yorkie a cursory snf, aswondering what theyaposre so pleased about. The clip is made all the more amusing by the hysterical laughter of a child that can be heard in the background.  The video has almost two million views on TikTok, with loads of dog lovers commenting on the pup’s adorable reaction. “The most wholesome thing I have ever seen,” one person gushed. “They just changed her batteries”, another commenter joked. Some also commented that their dog does something similar, kicking their back legs when they find a spot that they seem to love being scratched on.According to Hillaposs Pet Nutrition, this is an involuntary “scratch reflex” that dogs have.The nerves under a dog’s skin mean that when they’re tickled in a particular sweet spot, they just can’t help but kick their legs. It’s said to be an instinct to help protect dogs from things like fleas and ticks. While it may be involuntary, that doesn’t mean the dog isn’t enjoying the scratch action - and judging by the way the Yorkie in this video looks adoringly at their owner, they certainly seem to be having a good time. Of course, getting spruced up isn’t something that every dog loves.This Samoyedstruggled to hide just how much he hated bath time in another amusing TikTok video posted by@boomer_the_landcloud .The video shows Boomer looking increasingly less impressed as he goes reluctantly through the stages of being bathed. The clip ends up with the drenched pup looking very cross that he’s been put through such an ordeal, before his owner gives him a reassuring pet.

A third blame it on not being close enough to any bins, but  per cent put it down to not having a bag with them to carry the rubbish home.

Linda said: Eve, the cat went missing on the day after Halloween. The fireworks spooked her and thereaposs been no sign of her since then.  On Tuesday evening, I got a message from a man and judging from his profile it all seemed kind of legit, a picture of him and his we and his grandchild. He said: aposOh I have your missing catapos. Linda immediately asked for a picture of the tabby cat as she was afraid that it might not be her one, but the account stopped replying shortly after Linda asked for photos of the missing cat. She said: When I woke up the next morning and went into the messages, the profile had been deleted. Then I found message requests - three, four, five even. They were similar messages saying aposI have your cat can you come up to my house apos It was all obviously a ploy. It looked so believable. There were so many accounts like that in the space of  hours. I wouldnapost even say thataposs their real photo. Everything was . When I went into the other accounts, the accounts had been set up that day. It was scary. Linda contacted one of the admins of the local Facebook group, Finglas Fianna Fail Councillor Keith Connolly. He quickly changed the settings on the group after hearing Lindaaposs story, before finding and blocking a number of recently set up accounts that had been causing hassle in the group. Cllr Connolly said said: As a result of that I found four profiles that were set up that day. They all had a mutual friend. I think some of them were the same ones that messaged Linda because it looked like the same lad setting up four dferent accounts. He also received a message from one of the fake accounts at :pm, urging him to come fix the hole in their house. Another account posted in about their missing son, something that was later proven to be . Linda worries about what could have happeneda less tech-savvy person had received a message, especiallythey were desperate to find a family cat.. The mother used the messages to teach her -year-old daughter about the dangers of social media and how things arenapost always as the seem. She said: I knew myself I wouldnapost be going to a house without somebody. Iaposd be afraida teenager posed that theyaposd lost something then theyaposd go not thinking, or an elderly person or a vulnerable person. Thataposs where my concern was. They potentially could have gone round and God knows what would have happened. They didnapost have the cat so what did they want to do  Itaposs actually frightening. If I had gone I could have potentially not come back. MirrorOnline has contacted Facebook for comment.

Puco, two, could barely move from his bed after he was diagnosed with hereditary paraparesis, a neurological disease that weakens and stfens the leg muscles. Ken Jhay Empleo, his owner, patiently nursed the dog back to health. Ken said his pooch had also suffered from heatstroke prior to the diagnosis. Puco was hand-fed and hooked up to an IV drip in their home in Vigan City, the Philippines while undergoing physical therapy every day. After months of round-the-clock care and devotion, the paraplegic dog started to regain his strength.  He is now able to take strolls on his forelegs while wearing a makesht wheelchair to support his lower half last month in October. A heartwarming video has shown little Puco using a makesht wheelchair to explore with another dog. In another scene, Puco is seen walking without the makesht wheelchair and also running around a patio. Ken said: A miracle happened to him. I prayed that, evenhe couldnapost walk anymore, he would recover and regain his energy. I think God really did answer my prayers and gave me hope. Puco now gets by without his wheelchair, roaming Kenaposs home with a playful,unbalanced, spring in his step. In , a dog that was left paralysed in a road accident has been given a new lease of le thanks to a state-of-the-art PEDAL chair which helps her run again.  Puffy a Chinese Crested pooch lost the use of her rear legs when she was struck by a car in January  just days after getting her new home. It destroyed the nerve connection to her hind legs and there was nothing that TV’s Supervet could do to save her legs. But owners Michael and Danielle Cass refused to give up on their disabled pet. Puffy is now far more mobile thanks to the pedal cart from Kerdog.

The remote campsite is located next to three phone towers that were installed in , meaning it has far stronger signal than the nearby town of Carnarvon, Western Australia. Although police have not yet released all the details about how they found Cleo, they have admitted that phone data and a tip-off about a car in the area played a crucial role. Large swathes of the outback are reportedly dead zones for mobile phone signal, meaning it was a stroke of luck that the campsite was near new phone masts. Officers rescued the youngster from a locked home in Carnarvon after arresting Terence Darrell Kelly, who has been charged with forcibly taking a child under  Speaking about the rescue, Western Australia’s Deputy Police Commissioner Col Blanch previously said: “Weaposve collected phone data, witness statements, DNA, fingerprints, rubbish along the highways, CCTV - weaposve collected everything.  “We had to find that needle. Last night the needle in the haystack came out and they acted in a heartbeat. Intelligence led them to that house. They went into that house, Cleo was in the house alone. The moment that Kelly was arrested by police was filmed on Tuesday night in dashcam footage from a taxi. The -year-old could be seen being pulled over by officers and pinned to the ground. About an hour after Kelly was arrested, Cleo was rescued from his locked home, bringing her -day ordeal to an end.  Police broke into the house in Carnarvon, a town about  kmsouth of the campsite, early on Wednesday morning and discovered Cleo in one of the rooms.In moving bodycam footage after she was found, officers can be heard saying Iaposve got you, bubby and whataposs your name, sweetheart  before she replies my name is Cleo. When Cleo went missing on October  she was on the first night of a holiday at the Quobba Blowholes camping ground.

the firm who designed the revamped Union Terrace Gardens and the Olympic Park in London.Full business cases on road changes throughout the city centre # outside of the central stretch of Union Street # could be together by the end of next year, paving the way for the huge change.Top council officials are recommending the option to fully pedestrianise Union Street be approved # with an exception for cyclists # along the same stretch currently closed as part of the coronavirus physical distancing changes.Service vehicles would also be allowed into the pedestrianised zone but only during limited hours.To make losing a stretch of the city#s main thoroughfare work, roads bosses are also pressing for an overhaul of Market Street, Bridge Street and Guild Street.There, they want priority to be given to buses, taxis and private hires and bikes.Upperkirkgate and Schoolhill might also be pedestrianised, between Harriet Street and Flourmill Lane, while a ban on vehicles # except buses # turning right from Union Terrace into Rosemount Viaduct is also being recommended.The refresh of the city centre masterplan includes a new £m market on the former British Home Stores site, which was recently backed with £m of UK Government funding.Aberdeen beach is also in line for an overhaul # potentially including a new football stadium to replace Pittodrie, new sports facilities and a revamped Castlegate to improve the seafront#s links with the Granite Mile.Finance convener Ryan Houghton said: “These plans are a hugely ambitious statement of intent for Aberdeen.#They will not only act to heal the city from the economic damage inflicted by Covid-, but will also see us improve the health of our citizens by creating an open, accessible beachfront.#The proposals will breathe new le into our city centre, boost job creation and promote a wealth of opportunities to allow businesses and traders to thrive.#Above all, this new cityscape will bring the city back to the people, giving them easy access to a st century way of living that is open, inclusive and environmentally friendly.#Proposals to permanently ban cars from the central stretch of the city#s main thoroughfare first emerged  years ago.Angry bosses at the city#s two largest bus operators # Stagecoach Bluebird and First Aberdeen # recently penned an open letter to roads planners, demanding their access be reinstated to the stretch now set for permanent pedestrianisation.Their seven busiest stops sit on the stretch.Town House chiefs have noted public opinion on accessible parking, cycling facilities, bus stops and routing, taxi ranks and servicing arrangements and are promising more consultation on the concerns.Vice-convener and council leader, Jenny Laing, said: “The council is proud to put forward this report detailing the potential £m transformation of Aberdeen’s beach and city centre.#The report, and the detailed projects outlined within it, show the depth and breadth of our ambition, and our commitment to bring real, positive change for the people of Aberdeen.#Councillors will consider the plans at a meeting of the city growth committee on Friday.Financial details, as the local authority considers entering contracts for ious projects, will be discussed in private."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/MicrosoftTeams-image-22-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup[data-theme\"light\"] .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup[data-theme\"dark\"] .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supportsor .dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supportsor .dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off. The plane and boats had covered an extensive area of sea.Coastguards using mobile equipment searched along the shores of Arran and Kintyre.Nothing was seen.Police in Campbeltown began investigations into the matter shortly after the leboat put to sea their enquiries are continuing.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAuchencorvie United, one of the teams that came into being in the rural area as a result of the formation of sports clubs among agricultural workers, made their first appearance in local competitive football last Saturday afternoon.Drumlemble supplied the opposition and had a comparatively easy victory by four goals to nil.Auchencorvie had several players of some promise but, as a whole, the team was sadly wanting in science and judgement and the lesson of their first experience should impress on them the fact that mere lusty vigour is not sufficient to win on the football field.In the first half, Drumlemble did not press their undoubted superiority unduly, being content with a one-goal lead at the interval. James Munro was the scorer.In the second half they added three more to the total, D Thomson having two and A Kerr one.At the opening concert of the winter session of the Scottish Clans# Association of London Mr Charles Kelly, a well-known Campbeltown vocalist, sang with much success.His pieces were The March of the Cameron Men, The Lea Rigg, I Passed By Your Window and Until.In all these numbers he

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

Photographs from the early days up to  are from the collections of the late Robert Grieves and from John Sinclair, two indefatigable photographers whose material is of national Scottish importance. This week#s article is the conclusion.West Coast#s business portfolio now extends well beyond Kintyre.In , it bought the Glasgow Citybus concern which operates on the north side of the Clyde.Two years on, it also picked up a city tour business which is now operated under the City Sightseeing franchise in Glasgow.It also operates the inter-rail station shuttle in the city.An interesting ersication in  was what became a fast passenger ferry link from Campbeltown to Ballycastle while a few years further on, Fairline Coaches, based near the company#s Glasgow Citybus depot in Whiteinch, Glasgow, was absorbed into West Coast.The company also won the contract to operate Citylink#s new Glasgow-Edinburgh Airport service and additionally, partnered Fort William-based Shiel Buses on Citylink#s Glasgow-Fort William and Skye services.Perhaps the biggest and most signicant recent extension of West Coast#s business came with the creation of Borders Buses.

Firstly, I wish to acknowledge and applaud the drive and foresight of the Craig family in building the business from its original heartland in the southernmost area of Argyll.Public transport is full of challenges whether air, sea, rail or road and, as in every field of business le, there are never any guarantees of success.Once any business reaches a successful position, it often requires even more effort to maintain it there, let alone continue to grow it in size and influence.The presence of Covid since  has, of course, created major dficulties for every business virtually across the board.Finally, a word of praise for the staff and especially for those who are engaged on the vital long-distance links, particularly the Campbeltown, Oban and Skye services.These routes are not only amongst the most weather prone in Scotland, they operate almost exclusively over ordinary trunk roads, iniably convoluted in nature and of borderline width for the safe transit of long vehicles.A driver myself, though never on any of these routes, I#m familiar with all these roads and have some perception of the extreme challenges drivers frequently face.To them, and to all the company#s staff and management, I, and I#m sure many readers who are users of the services West Coast Motors provide across Argyll and in other parts of Scotland, offer grateful thanks."},{"url":null,"title":"muddy good rugby festival at taynuilt","story":"More than  players from Campbeltown, Lochgilphead, Oban, Fort William, Mull and Taynuilt took part with some fantastic rugby on display across all the age groups from the Micro P-Ps to the P s.Conditions were damp under foot given the amount of rain that has been falling lately.

And Irsquom already on my seventh napkin, wiping away a gloopslide of mayo and garlic, house dill and chilli pickles, melted cheese, all oozing from around moist chicken with a still crisp coating and all encased in a slick, buttered bun.I pause to consider the batter on these confit wings, dusted with micro spring onion, doused in en vogue Korean Gochujang paste.

El Perro may just have won the UKrsquos best burger for the second time ndash which is why I am here ndash and the classic burger that I have just consumed almost the very last bite of has been almost a joy, carefully, professionally, even artfully assembled.

Itrsquos surely a settled scientic fact that this is the best way to have a burger, but it also means the core flavours, the beef, the bun, and the balance are not hidden away behind flashy, frippery distractions.And also because I think El Perro are way, way good enough to serve the simple stuff too ndash even though they won their latest award for their Top Dog Burger with bone marrow, Roquefort and black truffle mayo.That burgerrsquos sitting right at the very top of the menu tonightbut as Irsquom currently post bone-marrow and officially way-weary of bloody truffle everywhere, especially on chips nowadays, I picked instead the plainest burger I could have in here.And frankly  For me  Strange but true: Itrsquos not been plain enough.Saying all that  As Irsquom sitting in yet another COP traffic queue later, this time at the end of Woodlands Road and as Joe Bidenrsquos cartoon cavalcade sweeps by feet away, cop whistles blowing, Secret Service gas guzzlers speeding, an American ambulance and an actual armoured car struggling to catch up, I ask myself this question: gloop aside, would I go back to El Perro  Yes.El Perro Negro Woodlands RoadGlasgow  Menu: Home of the best burger in the UK and itrsquos right in the heart of Glasgow. Small farm beef, buttered buns, attention to detail, plus all the usual chipotle, gochujung, truffle flavours.

There are a handful of guys who played in that game.

I think they underestimated Scotland.

It is understood that at least one class within every year group except P is affected by the spread.The two authorities confirmed, this Thursday evening, that any decision to shut the school would be a collective one — but it has not yet reached that point. The only caveat to this is in the eventuality that staff numbers are so depleted, the council has no option but to close Papdale, or reduce teaching hours.As of early this afternoon, only two members of staff have been confirmed to have the virus.In a statement this evening, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The school remains open, and the situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of NHS Orkney Public Health.“Our aim is to keep the school open as long as possible to provide learning for those pupils who are well. We are working on a daily basis with Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“However,staffing falls to a point whereby it is no longer possible to safely manage the pupil numbers in school — as happened in Stronsay Junior High School recently – then we, as the council, can take the decision to close or offer a rolling programme of reduced hours across the school.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social wellbeing.”The authorities have confirmed that a further ten PCR tests have also been requested in connection with Papdale Primary at this time, and contact tracing is ongoing. Parents with children attending the school have been urged to undertake twice-weekly lateral flow testing on both themselves and their little ones.Of the  pupils at the school,  pupils were absent on Thursday from the school — a drop from  on Wednesday. According to OIC, the reason many of these pupils remained at home was due to the COVID- situation —  whether for the purpose self-isolating, or because they are symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.Warn and inform letters have now been sent to the parents and carers of children in all affected classes within P, P, P, P, P and P, in line with Scottish Government and Public Health guidance.In addition, Papdale#s head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Across Orkney, a total of  new positive cases have been reported in today#s daily figures.According to NHS Orkney, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. The health authority has has said that this continued rise in cases is not unexpected.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “We are continuing to see cases riseand this is another day of high case numbers for Orkney, but we want to reassure the community that we are managing these cases.#Although, we do ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible. Vaccinations are underway for both COVID and Flu and these are progressing, but it is a complex and challenging undertaking.#Appointment letters are being sent out for the COVID booster vaccinations and we appreciate your patience during this time.”If you receive a positive lateral flow test result, or you have developed symptoms of COVID-, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

However, this deadline was extended by the minister following a statement to the Assembly.What is the new deadline to spend your card On Tuesday, Mr Lyons told the Northern Ireland Assembly the deadline to spend the high street voucher would be pushed forward into December.The minister said everyone will now have until December  to spend the entirety of the voucher – an additional two weeks on the original deadline. This has raised concerns it could offset cash spent over the Christmas period.Why has the scheme been extended The minister said issues around verying the identity of around , people had led to the decision to extend the deadline.He said these were people who had applied for the scheme whose personal details could not be veried by databases.He told the Stormont Assembly: None of these applicants have been rejected and every one of them has been given an opportunity to submit evidence that they live in Northern Ireland and are over  years old.The Assembly can be assured that we are applying maximum flexibility on the information that can be provided to confirm they are eligible for a Spend Local card.How many cards have been sent to date According to the most recent figures over .m cards have been dispatched and of these, over , have been activated.

It’s not always possible to live an entirely climate-friendly lestyle but there are still convenient changes we can make to our lives that will have a positive impact on the environment.Not everything on this climate-friendly living list will suit all lestyles picking up even just a few new habits can be a good way to start leading that all-important climatarian lestyle.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Eat localBuying local produce that hasn’t been flown or shipped in from another continent is an easy way to be more eco-friendly. Check out the labels on the fresh produce you buy from supermarkets and see where it has come from – the nearer, the better. Plus, there are plenty of independent restaurants in Belfast that serve local food from local vendors, such as Stock Kitchen and Bar in St George’s Market.Eat less meatThe meat industry is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide and methane into our atmosphere. Cutting down on steaks, sausages and burgers will mean that less meat is being produced – and you don’t need to cut it out entirelyyou prefer not to. How about trying meat-free Monday Eat seasonallyConsuming food that is in season is another good way to make our diets climate-friendly because it means we don’t need to import the produce from abroad. Apples, parsnips, carrots, potatoes and caullower all grow well at this time of year, while by springtime next year, you’ll want to look out for juicy beetroots, spring greens and rhubarb in your local shop.Walk moreIf you can, walking to your destination instead of those quick five-minute car journeys is a simple way to reduce your own carbon footprint – and it keeps you fit, too.Use public transportInstead of driving yourself somewhere as a single passenger, taking the bus or train means that more people use just one mode of transport which can drastically reduce carbon emissions in the city.Use reusable plasticInvest in a stylish water bottle that you’ll want to keep on you at all times. Many public spaces have refill stations that you can use and makes topping up your water bottle convenient and cheap. Or,you’re an avid coffee drinker, most coffee shops are happy to pour your drink into a reusable flask and some even give you points towards free coffeeyou do.Try a plant-based dietA plant-rich diet is a good way to live a more climatarian lestyle simply because it’s so much more energy efficient than eating meat. It cuts out all the emissions that come with animal agriculture instead of eating animals that eat plants, you’re cutting out the middleman and going straight for the greens. Supermarkets now have an ample selection of plant-based now too.Take the ferryThere’s no need to flight shame – after all, everyone needs to take flights now and again. Butyou are able to, consider taking the ferry across the water instead of a short-haul flight to save on carbon emissions.Avoid fast fashionFast fashion from the likes of Asos, Zara and Primark is highly unsustainable. It produces huge amounts of carbon emissions and lots of the textiles end up being binned. Instead, try out your local charity shops to give a piece of clothing new le, or opt for ‘investment’ pieces that are better quality, last longer and means you go through less material.Rewild your gardenSometimes doing nothing is better than doing something – and letting your garden grow is a perfect example. Rewildingcan increase carbon removal from the atmosphere and bring pollinators to your garden.RefillRefilling empty reusable plastic containers is better for the environment and your purse. You don’t need to spend money on buying more than necessary, and you prevent food being wasted or items going to landfill. There is a shop called the Refill Quarter on the Belmont Road where you can do this, and some Marks and Spencer stores also have the option to refill containers.Plant treesOK, not literally – butyou use a search engine called Ecosia, instead of Google, the  will plant trees in the places that need it most from the profits it makes from your searches.Reduce plastic consumptionWe all need to be a bit more conscious about the amount of single-use plastic we usewe want to be more climatarian. Take your own bags to the supermarket instead of buying more single-use ones and be aware of how much plastic packaging your food and goods are wrapped up in – there are sometimes alternatives packed in less or no plastic.Don’t waste foodProducing food and getting it to our local shops uses plenty of energy and water. It’s best to just buy what you need and keep a food waste or compost bin soyou do end up binning food, it can be used for good.RecycleMany of us already do this but we shouldn’t forget how important recycling is in the home. Recycling single-use plastics, cans and bottles ensures that the waste can be turned into something , and not sent to landfill. It’s a good skill to teach the kids too.Insulate your homeWhile on the pricey side, insulating your home is one of the best things homeowners can do to keep emissions low long-term, while also keeping your house warmer when it’s supposed to be. Some companies offer insulation grants to help you make your home more climatarian.Donate used goodsDon’t just bin the household items or clothes you don’t use anymore. Take them to a charity shop or sell the used goods online using s like Facebook Marketplace or eBay so that someone gets a second use out of them. Potentially good for your purse, your community and the planet – it’s a win-win situation.Avoid disposablesSingle-use items like disposable cutlery, straws and plates can be harmful to nature and the planetnot recycled properly. Wherever possible, try not to use it – oryou do need to, cardboard disposable items are more eco-friendly than plastic ones.Reduce electricity consumption in the homeKeeping your home energy consumption down is not only good for living a more climatarian lestyle, but also for keeping electricity costs down. No one is saying to live by candlelight, but there are small swaps you can make in the home that are better for the environment. Taking shorter showers, avoiding the tumble dryer and dish washer as much as you can, and using cosy blankets instead of heating where possible are all ways to keep energy consumption low.Drive efficientlyIt’s not always possible to walk or use public transport, so in the cases where you do need to drive, do it efficiently. Choosing a fuel-efficient vehicle can reduce the impact on the environment while saving you petrol money. And driving at a steady pace, too, means that your car will consume the fuel more efficiently.Consume lessThe truth is that protecting the planet will mean we all need to make some changes to our lestyles, starting with our attitudes as consumers. Think twice about whether you really need that cheap contraption you were thinking of buying from Amazon. Do you really need it  Buying less and buying better is a key but simple change we can all make to become more climatarian.Use vegan makeup brandsFor the beauty lovers, there are plenty of big makeup brands that are cruelty-free and vegan. Besides the moral benefits, vegan cosmetics tend to use more natural ingredients and fewer chemicals. Plus, some even have partnerships with eco-friendly brands so that part of your purchase will go towards saving the planet.Related topicsCOPMore On COPMayor of Los Angeles tests positive for Covid day after attending Cop breakfast co-hosted by Givan and O’Neill PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionPeople like you, me and Edwin Poots are not the problem here… the ultra-privileged and globally powerful areTranslink and Infrastructure Minister unveil new battery powered double decker Belfast buses PremiumRosalind SkillenOpinionWe’re not too small to make a dference in the fight for our planetNI Water unveils its plans for a greener energy futureMost ReadRetired RUC officers seek apology after SDLP Policing Board member Dolores Kelly ‘sectarianism’ remarkNorthern Ireland’s  best law firms : Full listI am victorious: Brave woman watches step dad Tommy Harris jailed after ‘vile, depraved’ attacksArson attack on car with Irish registration plates outside Rangers club on Shankill Road described as hate crimeUnmasked: Woman who stole £m and nearly bankrupted Tyrone firm… Julie McBrien blew cash on luxury lestyle while pretending to have cancerTop VideosPlayVideo: Councillor slams anti-parking campaign as ineffective without enforcementPlayCar with Irish registration plates set alight outside Rangers club on Shankill RoadPlayVideo: Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson reacts to overnight violence during anti-protocol protest at Belfast interfaceLatest Northern IrelandLee Lynch pounces to help Larne crank up heat at the top of Irish PremiershipJamie McGonigle holds his nerve to salvage a point for Derry CityShock at , convictions for attacks on NI’s frontline workers in four yearsDonaldson urges EU to ‘put Northern Ireland’s interests first’Belfast parking wars: Call for tougher action over cars being left on city’s pavementsLatestBritney Spears’s ex-business manager denies bugging singer’s bedroomSex And The City star Kim Cattrall reveals latest TV roleWhat the papers say – November Dolly Parton set for  to  reunion with Grace And Frankie guest roleDavid Ginola tipped for I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here appearance,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Let the conversation lead to tangible action.”Meanwhile, in a first for the UK, the company has just completed a pilot electrolyser project based in its treatment works at Kinnegar near Belfast.The results show the potential to produce both green hydrogen, which could be used to power buses and other heavy transport, and oxygen, which could increase the capacity of its wastewater treatment plants.Related topicsNichola MallonDepartment for InfrastructureCOPMore On Nichola MallonBelfast parking wars: Call for tougher action over cars being left on city’s pavements‘A lack of leadership shown’ by flying to climate summitDerry’s Foyleservice to be fully zero-emission by SDLP and SF play the blame game over end to £ uplt in Universal Credit Premium‘Protestant Action Force’ claim Ards bus hijacking start of NI Protocol campaignMost ReadRetired RUC officers seek apology after SDLP Policing Board member Dolores Kelly ‘sectarianism’ remarkNorthern Ireland’s  best law firms : Full listI am victorious: Brave woman watches step dad Tommy Harris jailed after ‘vile, depraved’ attacksArson attack on car with Irish registration plates outside Rangers club on Shankill Road described as hate crimeUnmasked: Woman who stole £m and nearly bankrupted Tyrone firm… Julie McBrien blew cash on luxury lestyle while pretending to have cancerTop VideosPlayVideo: Councillor slams anti-parking campaign as ineffective without enforcementPlayCar with Irish registration plates set alight outside Rangers club on Shankill RoadPlayVideo: Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson reacts to overnight violence during anti-protocol protest at Belfast interfaceLatest Northern IrelandLee Lynch pounces to help Larne crank up heat at the top of Irish PremiershipJamie McGonigle holds his nerve to salvage a point for Derry CityShock at , convictions for attacks on NI’s frontline workers in four yearsDonaldson urges EU to ‘put Northern Ireland’s interests first’Belfast parking wars: Call for tougher action over cars being left on city’s pavementsLatestMillions to be worse off despite Universal Credit changes in Budget – analysisLord Kamlesh Patel tasked with leading change needed at YorkshireBritney Spears’s ex-business manager denies bugging singer’s bedroomSex And The City star Kim Cattrall reveals latest TV roleWhat the papers say – November ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.“The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging, I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit”.Related topicsDolores KellySDLPPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Dolores Kelly PremiumPSNI isn’t a cold house for female officers, insists Chief Constable Simon ByrneWe must do more to encourage Catholics to join PSNI, insists KellyStephen Barriskill murder probe: Man remains in custody after fatal Portadown shooting PremiumConcern as complaints against PSNI rise by over % in the space of a year PremiumMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentMost ReadRetired RUC officers seek apology after SDLP Policing Board member Dolores Kelly ‘sectarianism’ remarkNorthern Ireland’s  best law firms : Full listI am victorious: Brave woman watches step dad Tommy Harris jailed after ‘vile, depraved’ attacksArson attack on car with Irish registration plates outside Rangers club on Shankill Road described as hate crimeUnmasked: Woman who stole £m and nearly bankrupted Tyrone firm… Julie McBrien blew cash on luxury lestyle while pretending to have cancerTop VideosPlayVideo: Councillor slams anti-parking campaign as ineffective without enforcementPlayCar with Irish registration plates set alight outside Rangers club on Shankill RoadPlayVideo: Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson reacts to overnight violence during anti-protocol protest at Belfast interfaceLatest Northern IrelandLee Lynch pounces to help Larne crank up heat at the top of Irish PremiershipJamie McGonigle holds his nerve to salvage a point for Derry CityShock at , convictions for attacks on NI’s frontline workers in four yearsDonaldson urges EU to ‘put Northern Ireland’s interests first’Belfast parking wars: Call for tougher action over cars being left on city’s pavementsLatestMillions to be worse off despite Universal Credit changes in Budget – analysisLord Kamlesh Patel tasked with leading change needed at YorkshireBritney Spears’s ex-business manager denies bugging singer’s bedroomSex And The City star Kim Cattrall reveals latest TV roleWhat the papers say – November ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The meetings are all on webcam - I don#t know when my face is on the camera. I have to sit with a completely deadpan face and I can#t even laugh when something funny happens because I might be seen to favour one party, she said.When she became chief executive of the council, Ms Wylie said she thought I was more resilient than I actually was. She cited a controversy in which Belfast City Council was revealed to have spent more than £, of ratepayers# money putting its staff and councillors up in luxurious hotels around the world, including Donald Trump#s five-star hotel in Las Vegas and the five-star China World Hotel in Beijing.Speaking on Thursday, Ms Wylie said when it came to being on the front pages of the papers are on Twitter - you#re just in the spotlight and your kids are affected. She said: My dry cleaners are always waiting for me to come.They spoke to her about spending all that money in China - I tell them, you can#t believe everything you read in the papers. I went to China with the mayor, who was a Sinn Fein mayor, we were trying to get more investment, the paper had used a photograph of Trump Towers in Las Vegas to try and create dollar signs all over - I#ve never been to Las Vegas.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Another dficulty was a failed bid to achieve the title of European Capital of Culture in  for Belfast and Londonderry after the European Commission ruled that a UK city could not host the title after Brexit. Ms Wylie said it was a big journey during which we#d spent so much money and the press were asking us - how much money did you spend I got the councillors to agree, I took them to Brussels. Eventually it was nope, we#re out of the EU so it can#t progress any further.The lesson I learned was turn it around somehow - we developed a ten year cultural plan as a result.The ten year plan Ms Wylie said will result in major events in  and  and what#s expected to be a new Belfast visitor attraction on the same scale as the Titanic Visitor Experience. She recently met with down-to-earth Sir Kenneth Branagh to ask him to be an ambassador for the new initiative.At the end of  and throughout , loyalist protests took place across Northern Ireland over the decision to fly the union flag at Belfast City Hall only on designated days. Ms Wylie, who was not the chief executive at the time, said: I have to admit I didn#t know that every day the union flag was flown on city hall. We didn#t have any idea how much [outcry] there would be.Protestors tried to storm the City Hall and burnt Irish tricolours after the vote. Two police officers were injured in the fracas.Ms Wylie said: I had a whole plan that we would all move into another room but of course someone stood up in the public gallery and before I knew it everyone was running down to stairs. I was on the phone to the police and said how long, when can you get here and they said half-an-hour.When she became chief executive she said of course there#s politics with symbols and statues. I worked with party leaders, I had to learn my history.It#s after having a strict religious upbringing but one in which her family was not touched directly by the Troubles, which she said is an important factor in how she dealt with political parties. I didn#t really feel asI was from one community or background, she said.She wasn#t considered promising academically at school but eventually studied environmental science route at Ulster University.A seminal moment came when her boyfriend died at a young age. It burst my bubble, I thought, I have to do things for myself. You just dig deep and in terms of resilience, that was a seminal moment for me.Straight after university, she secured a position at Belfast City Council as an environmental health officer, a role she described as very erse. I went to all part of Belfast right in the middle of the Troubles. In west Belfast, three guys stopped me and asked who I was, took my number. I very quickly realised how ided society was, she said.Ms Wylie thought she might became a manager in her department or work for a community organisation but not in a million years did she imagine herself as a CEO. I#ve probably done every job in the council - I#ve been out with the binman.She at one stage became head of urban development and said: I looked out the door at the heads of the services around me and thought, I#ve got to convince them I#m capable of doing this job.The former principal of Belfast Met Marie Therese McGivern supported her as a mentor in Ms Wylie#s urban development role and encouraged her to go outside her organisation to find mentors. Informal mentors supported her when Ms Wylie when I went for a few jobs recently and set up mock interviews for her.Her favourite part of the chief executive role was creating a four year city plan. Vision is at the heart of my leadership style.Bringing the leaders of the dferent political parties is very intensive, she said. I did have some champions among the group of politicians - who really got it and could bring the rest of their parties along with them.There will be a launch and an announcement on the city deal in the next few weeks which is about to be completely signed up by the UK government, resulting in £m of investments in the city region.But Ms Wylie said she was told the city deal could be a career-limiting move because NI wasn#t ready for more devolution. However when there#s money on the table, it always brings people together, she said.The chief executive said she has mixed emotions leaving the role but said a CEO position has a lespan. It#s like leaving your baby, she said. I have taken the city and council from I believe on organisation that focused on delivering services to one that focuses on the success of the city. It#s for somebody  now to take it to the next stage, she said.She was headhunted for the Jersey role and still hasn#t found somewhere to live there, a condition of the role.They came to me because their politics can be very dficult, they have a big financial services industry that needs to ersy.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation. The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaWATCH: Passport drama denies County Derry weighlter chance to represent Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsChadian man arrested at County Derry roundabout refused bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportPREVIEW: Galaxy of stars on view as Glen bid for first title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaWATCH: Passport drama denies County Derry weighlter chance to represent Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsChadian man arrested at County Derry roundabout refused bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportPREVIEW: Galaxy of stars on view as Glen bid for first title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Minister has released funds to provide additional support for housing associationsReporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson has urged all parties to get behind the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey’s plans to transform housing in the North. Ms Hargey has approved an extra poundmillion towards additional support for housing associations. This comes on top of the increased new build budget of poundmillion. The Minister that the new build programme, along with the additional funds, was there to address the issue of housing stress both in the present-day and beyond. googletag.cmd.push Ms Ferguson backed the Minister saying that everyone had the right to a decent home and urged other parties to give their support to ensure that aim can fulfilled. She said: “Sinn Feacutein Minister Deirdre Hargey is taking forward the biggest transformation in public housing in  years, getting the Housing Executive back to building social and affordable homes. “Everyone should have the right to a decent home, and I commend the minister for her leadership in taking on the issues of affordability, building more homes and equal access to housing which need to be addressed. “Finance Minister Conor Murphy also recently announced the largest house building budget in over a decade and work has started on over , new homes in the last year, surpassing the target by  percent. “She is also taking forward legislative change through her Private Tenancies Bill, to protect renters, while proposals for rent controls and rent freezes are also under consideration. “Minister Hargey has also increased support for Co-Ownership and is consulting on alternative avenues to home ownership which are genuinely accessible and affordable to workers and families. “The Minister has demonstrated a remarkable determination to grasp this issue, but such is the scale of the challenge, that this cannot be left to one minister alone – we need people and organisations working together. “Equality in housing cannot wait. The need for more social and affordable homes, particularly in places like the north west, cannot be ignored and I would hope that all parties could get behind this ambitious plan to deliver real and tangible change for current and future generations.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaWATCH: Passport drama denies County Derry weighlter chance to represent Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsChadian man arrested at County Derry roundabout refused bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportPREVIEW: Galaxy of stars on view as Glen bid for first title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Governments from across the world are currently attending the conference on climate change in Glasgow with the aim of seeing what can be done to halt global warming. googletag.cmd.push Activists from all over are making sure their political leaders are being held to account and Derry is no dferent with the North West Climate Coalition making their voices heard prior to Saturdays Global Day of Action march in the city. People Before Profit Counicllor, Maeve ONeill – who is also a member of the North West Climate Coalition – said: “Previous Climate Conferences of world leaders has gotten us no where near to taking proper action on the climate crisis. “It is nothing more than a greenwashing opportunity for those in power. “Real change will come from the organising and mass mobilisation of millions of people across this world. “This is people power and its the most effective tool we have in making the transformative change we need.” Ms ONeills fellow People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, said that while the parties in the Stormont Executive have been saying all the right things about climate change, their talk has yet to be matched by positive action. He added: “Over the past week, every local mainstream party has paraded its commitment to the environment. “They have all sent representatives to Glasgow to give interviews in an effort to associate themselves with calls for drastic action to save the world. They were just as unanimous back in  in voting at the Assembly for a public inquiry into how more than a million tonnes of toxic waste was dumped on Derry’s doorstep. “But there’s been no public inquiry. The toxic waste still festers there, with nobody held responsible. “Now that the environment is top of the news agenda, they are all out presenting their counterfeit credentials as fighters against the creation of waste and pollution of the land. “The only thing the establishment parties are serious about recycling is empty rhetoric.” The Global Day of Action takes place on Saturday, November  at pm in Waterloo Place, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaWATCH: Passport drama denies County Derry weighlter chance to represent Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsChadian man arrested at County Derry roundabout refused bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportPREVIEW: Galaxy of stars on view as Glen bid for first title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

Triumph Hurdle winner Quilixios faces five rivals including fellow Cheltenham winner Jeff Kidder as jump racing s to Naas for the first time this season. Rachael Blackmore will be aboard the Henry de Bromhead-trained Quilixios as the Cheltenham hero makes his seasonal debut in a race that was won by subsequent Champion Hurdle winner Espoir D’Allen in . googletag.cmd.push After a summer campaign on the Flat, Ballymore Champion Four Year Old Hurdle winner, Jeff Kidder will make hisover hurdles against a field that includes Gowran Park maiden winner An Epic Song and Gordon Elliott’s Grade  winner Teahupoo. Elliott is looking to win the Grade  BetVictor Fishery Lane Hurdle for a third successive year following the victories of Call Me Lyreen and Surin and is hopeful his son of Masked Marvel canto winning ways on his seasonal bow. “Teahupoo showed a good level of form last season which was very pleasing,” Elliott said this morning. “He is a horse that always looked like he would progress with a summer behind him. This Saturday looks a hot race but we are looking forward to getting him started.” Elliott also has a strong hand in the Grade  Poplar Square Chase with Felix Desjy the highest rated of the six runner field and he is joined by stable companion Andy Dufresne. Captain Guinness and Darver Star who were placed in the Arkle and Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham respectively add plenty of depth to the field. Elliott reported: “Both horses showed some quality form last season and they both line up with decent chances. Felix Desjy won a Grade  at Punchestown this time last year which is good form and Andy Dufresne ran a solid race in a Grade  and is a solid horse on his day.” Punters can look forward to a competitive renewal of the BetVictor Brown Lad Handicap Hurdle with  runners declared including the Michael Bowe-trained Sweet Sting who would be a fitting winner after the loss of Solernia this week.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaWATCH: Passport drama denies County Derry weighlter chance to represent Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsChadian man arrested at County Derry roundabout refused bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ John Ts  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportPREVIEW: Galaxy of stars on view as Glen bid for first title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Lavey forced the game to extra time, but Slaughtneils fitness and technical nous won through in the end to give them a four-point victory. Brendan Rogers evades Emmett Bradley when the sides met in . Glen have come to le in this competitions knock-out stages. Seven of their nine goals have been scored in the last three games, with three green flags raised the last day out against Loup. All three knockout wins have been comprehensive, with Foreglen and Swatragh put to the sword in the first round and quarter final respectively. There is no doubt we are about to watch the two best football teams in Derry contest the county final. Slaughtneil have hit a championship total of - , and have conceded - , leaving a total scoring dference of +. Frighteningly, Glens scoring total is higher and they have conceded even less. Malachy ORourkes side have hit -and conceded - , leaving their score dference at +. Danny Tallon Paul Bradleys men will point to their opposition in the last two rounds in mitigation, but there is no doubt that given space, Glen are a formidable scoring force. The feeling that Glen are coming for the winners enclosure is counteracted by the feeling that Slaughtneil will never leave. The Emmets clinched their sixth-ever title in last years decider, played amid autumn Covid restrictions at Bellaghy, and their recent dominance has been watched with envious eyes in their midst. Glen are facing into only their second senior final ever and have never won the competition. A glut of underage success, however, is starting to mature into optimism. Ciaran McFaul can make Glen tick. Watty Grahams won four Ulster minor titles in the early s, and with the talismanic Conor Glass back in the fold, and the hugely-respected Malachy ORourke in the dug out, they will be hopeful. Despite their respective winning pedigrees, this cannot be cast as David v Goliath. Recent meetings have shown these sides are neck-in-neck. When the sides met in the league decider in , the lanes around the Emmets came to a standstill with the traffic. Slaughtneil won. Later that year, Glen turned the tables in an epic encounter at Owenbeg. The Emmets responded by calmly winning back the John McLaughlin the following year. STATISTICS   KEY BATTLES Shane McGuigan v Michael Warnock Tale as old as time. Shane McGuigan draws close attention wherever he goes, and Warnock will have responsibility for tracking him around Celtic Park. McGuigan is the championships top scorer with -, the man whose hands the Emmets will attempt to work the ball. Subduing his influence wont win Glen the game on its own, but it would certainly help. Chrissy McKaigue v Ciaran McFaul While not in direct combat, McFaul and McKaigue are the pivot on which their teams performance leans. Both adept at controlling play, linking defence and attack, and popping up with scores of their own, their opposition will need to employ concentration and work rate to curb their influence. The prospect of watching these two dictating play is a mouth-watering one. Conor Glass v Patsy Bradley Gaels all over Derry have been dreaming of this midfield battle occurring in championship heat for years, and would no doubt be in favour of an all kick outs long policy for this very reason. Barring a major sht in trends, that is unlikely, but the physical contest between the pair will be intriguing. Between this and the other midfield battle of Emmett Bradley and Paacutedraig Cassidy, its outcome could go a long way to deciding the game. Brendan Rogers v Paul Gunning Gunning is the only man who could possibly still challenge Shane McGuigan for top scorer, but he will have his work cut out against the experience and power of Slaughtneil full back Rogers. The Glen forward sits third on the leaderboard with - and has the guile and composure to cause some problems. Rogers has his role down to a tee though, and Gunning will have to be on his guard too to stop him launching attacks from deep. IN CONCLUSION There is a potential classic in store at Celtic Park on Sunday. A glance down both team sheets highlights a plethora of star names. Both sides will come to play football, and the crowds will come in anticipation of the same. Celtic Park hits that bit dferent in autumn, with John McLaughlin all ribboned up and sitting in the stand. The last time Glen were this close they had to walk past it, with excited Magherafelt yelps stinging hard and probably haunting them long into the winter. They have the ability to exorcise those demonsthey hold their nerve against Derry GAAs perennial winners.

Holed up in Owenbeg over the last few weeks in the company of its fraternal silverware, it will make navigate the road works en route to Celtic Park. googletag.cmd.push It will be followed north by two teams who will start their journey at almost the exact same point. When it comes to local rivalries, this one is just that little bit closer. Green and yellow flags have sat uneasily next to the maroon and white around Maghera since both teams won their respective semi finals last weekend.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Finn Harps  Derry City   There was huge drama at Finn Park as Jamie McGonigle’s late penalty saved Derry City from defeat in a dramatic finale in the Northwest derby. It looked asthe Candystripes were headed to defeat when Ethan Boyle headed Harps into the lead with just  minutes remaining, but McGonigle kept his nerve when presented with a penalty just  minutes later. googletag.cmd.push The point does not help either side, with Harps still in relegation trouble, while City have just won one game in their last six. The first hour gave no hint of the late drama to come. It was all Harps in the early stages, and Babatunde Owolabi could have opened the scoring within two minutes as he shrugged off Cameron McJannet before bearing down on goal and shooting high into the side netting. Harps were only encouraged by that and minutes later Nathan Gartside had to be alert to push away a volley from Ethan Boyle, who tried his luck from  yards as the Derry defence stood off. It took Derry City  minutes to have a shot of any sort at Mark McGinley in the Harps goal, but Ciaron Harkin’s effort from  yards rolled harmlessly wide without bothering the Harps goalkeeper. There was simply nothing between the sides as the game went on but Derry City should have nicked it on  minutes. Harps lost possession in midfield and James Akintunde flicked the ball over the defence to put substitute Jamie McGonigle in on goal. The striker was one on one with Mark McGinley but lobbed it over the goalkeeper and the open goal and the chance was gone. That proved to be costly for Derry as Harps went down the other end and scored within  seconds. Ryan Connolly delivered a free kick into the heart of the City penalty area and it was met by Ethan Boyle who powered a header past Gartside into the net. Harps’ jubilation was cut abruptly short within a minute however as Boyle went from hero to villain as he was adjudged to have handled Jamie McGonigle’s cross and referee Ben Connolly pointed to the penalty spot. It was McGonigle who stepped up and he sent McGonigle the wrong way to score a vital equaliser for Derry City.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Finn Harps  Derry City   There was huge drama at Finn Park as Jamie McGonigle’s late penalty saved Derry City from defeat in a dramatic finale in the Northwest derby. It looked asthe Candystripes were headed to defeat when Ethan Boyle headed Harps into the lead with just  minutes remaining, but McGonigle kept his nerve when presented with a penalty just  minutes later. googletag.cmd.push The point does not help either side, with Harps still in relegation trouble, while City have just won one game in their last six. The first hour gave no hint of the late drama to come. It was all Harps in the early stages, and Babatunde Owolabi could have opened the scoring within two minutes as he shrugged off Cameron McJannet before bearing down on goal and shooting high into the side netting. Harps were only encouraged by that and minutes later Nathan Gartside had to be alert to push away a volley from Ethan Boyle, who tried his luck from  yards as the Derry defence stood off. It took Derry City  minutes to have a shot of any sort at Mark McGinley in the Harps goal, but Ciaron Harkin’s effort from  yards rolled harmlessly wide without bothering the Harps goalkeeper. There was simply nothing between the sides as the game went on but Derry City should have nicked it on  minutes. Harps lost possession in midfield and James Akintunde flicked the ball over the defence to put substitute Jamie McGonigle in on goal. The striker was one on one with Mark McGinley but lobbed it over the goalkeeper and the open goal and the chance was gone. That proved to be costly for Derry as Harps went down the other end and scored within  seconds. Ryan Connolly delivered a free kick into the heart of the City penalty area and it was met by Ethan Boyle who powered a header past Gartside into the net. Harps’ jubilation was cut abruptly short within a minute however as Boyle went from hero to villain as he was adjudged to have handled Jamie McGonigle’s cross and referee Ben Connolly pointed to the penalty spot. It was McGonigle who stepped up and he sent McGonigle the wrong way to score a vital equaliser for Derry City.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like. Anyway. googletag.cmd.push For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   . Tickets are pound each with all proceeds being ided between the two charities. Those unable to make it, can still donate by going to the JustGiving Page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kites.jpg","title":"Birds of prey finding a safe home  ","story":"BIRD feeding for the majority of people means putting out some seeds and nuts but Stephen and Karen Malcomson have taken this to the next level and beyond.At their farm in the townland of Dechomet in Ballyward on the western slopes of Slieve Croob, the couple have developed a wildle sanctuary mdash The Red Kite Retreat mdash with a custom built hide for guests to observe the fantastic aerial displays of the Red Kites.The retreat is the only Red Kite feeding station and bird hide in Ireland, located on the Malcomson family farm.Although the Red Kites were persecuted to extinction in Ireland over  years ago, they were successfully reintroduced in  when the RSPB Northern Ireland, the Golden Eagle Trust and the Welsh Kite Trust mdash in conjunction with local councils mdash began an ambitious reintroduction project to help bring the magnicent birds back to Northern Ireland.The Malcomsonsrsquo farm lies at the epicentre of their habitat in Northern Ireland and visitors can now sit in the newly constructed bird hide and watch these majestic birds feed and soar through the skies.In addition, a planning application has been submitted for a caravan and camping site on the farm, with a classroom for education and conservation events.ldquoWe are now officially open, said a delighted Karen.ldquoIt has been a long road and we wish to thank you everyone who has helped us get to this point. The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

While Downpatrick has the Fountain Foodbank, Banbridge has a Christian ministry group called J based in the old cinema which will be supporting  families this Christmas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"McKee stands down from UUP  ","story":"MOURNES Ulster Unionist councillor Harold McKee has quit the party.The veteran politician and former South Down MLA has resigned, saying that Doug Beattiersquos leadership of the party is at odds with his religious beliefs.Cllr McKee, who will remain an independent member of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, criticised Mr Beattie for advising members to ldquoleave their Christianity at the door.His resignation comes ahead of next Mayrsquos Assembly election when his wide network of connections across the Mournes area would havebeen a key part of the UUPrsquos drive to secure a seat in South Down.Cllr McKee has confirmed that he intends to serve as an independent ldquoat this point in time with some suggesting that he could potentially be approached by the DUP to join its three councillors on the local authority.He has attacked his former party leader over his stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and a recent vote at Stormont on gay conversion therapy.ldquoIn relation to same sex marriage which Mr Beattie is keen to endorse, I cannot go against the infallible word of God that marriage is between one man and one woman, said Cllr McKee.ldquoI am saddened to observe that these views seem to be of little value in the UUP of today but, rather, a stance of celebrating left-of-centre liberalism seems to be the only acceptable viewpoint.His resignation statement said Mr Beattiersquos leadership was ldquoa far cry from the UUP roots and ldquothe party of Carson and Craig.When Mr Beattie succeeded Steve Aiken as UUP leader earlier this year, he pledged to have a dferent style that would be ldquoable to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity.Cllr McKee said it was ldquobecoming very dficult to endorse a leader who is constantly to the fore promoting liberal issues while conservative values were being squeezedout. A UUP spokesperson said the party was sorry that Mr McKee had decided his political future no longer lay with the UUP.ldquoWe would like to thank Harold for his service and wish him well for the future, the spokesperson said. ldquoThe party will continue to hold out the hand of friendship as Harold takes a new path.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis has described the decision by his former colleague to quit as ldquodisappointing.He continued: ldquoThere are many things that I find myself disagreeing with in all parties, not just my own and sometimes I find that it is better to continue to lobby, talk through and progress these issues from the inside, rather than walk out the door.ldquoThatrsquos democratic politics. Nobody is going to call for the gallows just because your opinion dfers, no matter how rigorous the debate. Unionism demands cohesion with the avoidance of ision.Cllr Lewis also thanked his former colleague for his ldquohelp, support, wisdom and guidance since he was elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He added: ldquoI will always consider Harold a friend and fellow unionist. He has overcome personal turmoil and, like many of us, has a strong faith which has encouraged and supported him through dficult times.ldquoI genuinely wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do next.Earlier this year, DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen quit their party over concerns following the election of Edwin Poots as leader.Mr Poots was subsequently replaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and a short time later Cllr Hanna, who also represents the Mournes area, and Cllr Owen, who represents the Rowallane area, rejoined the party..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_pitch.jpg","title":"New £12m sports pitch at Ballyhornan ‘fantastic facility’ for local community  ","story":"BALLYHORNANrsquoS new G sports pitch has been officially opened.The pound.m investment mdash which includes floodlights and ultra-modern changing facilities mdash has been funded by the Northern Ireland Executiversquos Social Investment Fund and Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Located adjacent to the Ballyhornan Family Centre, the new pitch is already widely used and has brought a number of benefits to the community.The Social Investment Fund contributed pound.m to the new development with the remainder provided by the local authority, with the Ballyhornan Community Association playing a pivotal role in helping secure the funding for the new pitch which was completed in October last year.Designed to increase access to community and leisure services by providing a fit-for-purpose, safe and structured environment to meet the needs and expectations of the Ballyhornan community and surrounding area, the new pitch will make a major contribution to help improve the health and well-being of people in the area.Ballyhornan and District Community Association chairwoman, Patricia Curran, expressed her delight to finally have a completed facility after years of rallying to secure funding for the G pitch which can be used all year round.ldquoWe are very grateful to all the statutory bodies and the local council who supported us throughout this campaign. Without them, we would not have achieved our goal, said Mrs Curran.ldquoThis pitch will be a great asset to Ballyhornan and outlying communities and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to provide a top of the range sports facility.Mrs Curran extended thanks to several people who worked with community officials to secure agreement for the new pitch and deliver it.Special thanks were extended to former local council officer Liam McLernon, Cllr Dermot Curran and former councillor Naomi Bailie for their ldquoimmense support.Mrs Curran also highlighted the support of Celtic Bhoys Football Club which uses the new pitch for its home games. She said the clubrsquos support was essential ldquoin making the project a success.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who performed the official opening, said one of the organisationrsquos key objectives was to improve the health and wellbeing of everyone in the district and reduce health inequalities.ldquoThis new facility will become a thriving hub that will have a hugely positive impact on the local area, benefitting the health and wellbeing of people of all ages by offering improved access to modern sporting facilities, she said.ldquoThis fantastic new facility is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups and the health and wellbeing impact on our community will be immense.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the official opening of the new pitch was ldquotestament to the work done by Mrs Curran and the team at Ballyhornan, working alongside officials from a number of organisations and elected representatives.ldquoItrsquos a real joy to see a picture of the late Eddie McGrady in the community centre in Ballyhornan who officially opened the building, he continued.ldquoThis latest development should serve as a reminder as to what can be delivered when communities, political representatives and government bodies work together in a common effort. I can only hope we get to see more of these good news stories in the time ahead.Cllr Curran said he was ldquodelighted to attend last weekrsquos official opening ceremony and thanked the funders of the new pitch for their respective contributions.ldquoThese investments are investments in our community and something we should all be very proud of. However, none of this would have happened without the hard work and determination of Patricia Curran and her team, he continued.ldquoGetting to this point over the past  years was a hard road with plenty of potholes, but Patricia never gave up. I am delighted that with help she get over those hurdles. However, had it not been for her dedication, this new pitch development simply wouldnrsquot have been possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_billy.jpg","title":"Politicians say ‘no’ to plan for school  ","story":"A NUMBER of politicians and school principals are opposed to creating a new integrated education college in the area.The proposed -place Mid Down Integrated Collegewould replace Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, providing sixth-form places.Public consultation into the development proposal brought forward by the MDIC steering group ended in September and the Education Authorityhas already given its response to the parentsrsquo group behind the proposal.However, DUP politicians and three of four post-primary schools in the area mdash Saintfield High School, St Colmanrsquos High School and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch and St Colmcillersquos High in Crossgar mdash have publicly voiced their concerns for the first time.Strangford MLA Harry Harvey said: ldquoI am disappointed that despite widespread opposition locally, the Education Authority continue to press ahead with these proposals. The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests. An inclusive and imaginative solution would have received our whole-hearted support, but this current proposal unfortunately fell short of this vision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Smell in Downpatrick causes stink with MLA  ","story":"A PERSISTENT foul smelling odour which is prevalent in a large part of Downpatrick is to be addressed by Northern Ireland Water.The utility company is to invest in a permanent dosing plant that will be added to sewage before it is pumped for treatment, with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath.He said he had been lobbying for the odour issue to be addressed and had been working with NI Water to come up with a solution to the problem,The foul smell is noticeable in a large part of Downpatrick including the Ballymote Centre and parts of Killough Walk, Glebetown Drive, Bishops Brae Gardens, Mallard Road, Braeside Drive, Vianstown Road, Cathedral View, Pemberton Park and Pegasus Walk.ldquoEssentially we are looking at a quarter of Downpatrick affected by this odour issue, said Mr McGrath.ldquoIt has been a long road to get to this point, but NI Water is working to come up with a solution.

The PSNI stated that they did not think so.Before Lord Alderdice lectures others on a more “moderate approach” he needs to reconsider his refusal to apologise for those words which many of his fellow Prebyterian elders found so wounding and unnecessary.It is entirely appropriate therefore that his book is being launched in a denomination which does not subscribe to the subordinate standards of the PCI.Ronnie Crawford, Dromore——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is to be hoped that London maintains this position, despite the bellicose talk from Brussels and the recent warning about British-Irish relations from Micheal MartinArt  is triggered. Those relations were already strained due to relentless nationalism from Dublin, over matters including legacy. Mr Martin is not to blame for that in the way that Mr Varadkar and Simon Coveney but his predecessors have put him in no position.The protocol was agreed under duress, and must be overhauled, regardless of EU threats.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Arlene Foster’s first TV appearance, at age , after the IRA bombed her school busMrs Foster also voiced pessimism about the Province’s political prospects, suggesting Sinn Fein does not “want Northern Ireland to work”.Mrs Foster’s comments came as part of an exhibition called ExtraORDINARY Women, comprised of stories and opinions from a raft of Northern Irish women in dferent fields.The main thrust of her piece is the isive nature of politics in Northern Ireland, and she laments that anybody who even exchanges a pleasant word with a political opponent risks marking themselves out as “weak” and “weird”.Mrs Foster – now aged  – first came to public attention when she gave an interview to national television at age , after the IRA detonated a bomb on her school bus.A solicitor by trade, she was elected as an MLA in , for her home constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone.She then ditched the UUP in  and joined the DUP.Down the years she has been Northern Ireland’s minister for enterprise, the environment, and finance, as well as being First Minister from May , , to June , , when she was ousted in a coup that brought Edwin Poots to power – before his leadership crumbled too mere weeks later.Her contribution piece for the museum is titled ‘A Little Less Twitter, A Lot More Thought and Direct Conversation’, and begins: “When you leave elected office in the fashion I have, the obvious question is: ‘What are you going to do next ’“The honest answer is I’m not really sure! There are plenty of things I’d like to do, but what one is capable of doing is an altogether dferent kettle of fish!”It continues as follows: “For so long now I have been steeped in NI and its dficult politics.“Yes, all politics is challenging – it’s part of the reason why we do it, but being the leader of the largest Unionist party whilst a privilege of course brings its own downsides. “Due to the nature of politics here the isiveness is stark – you are seen as somewhat strangeyou have friends in other political parties. “It reminds me of the Labour member who claimed proudly that she had never, nor would she ever, snog a Tory. “Well in NI,you are in the pleasant-exchange-territory then you are seen as somewhat of a weakling, never mind the latter!“Looking in at the Palace of Westminster I had always thought politics to be mostly civil. “Of course that is a generalisation, and I found that out when I attended a Policy Exchange event to launch the ‘The age of Incivility: Understanding the new politics’ back in . “The subsequent call for evidence was important because it is right that we understand the issue from a data point of view, rather than anecdotal stories – of which some of us have many! “The launch was chaired by Trevor Phillips former Equality and Human Rights Commission Chair and was attended by members from across the political spectrum – and that’s the important point: people from dferent perspectives discussing issues in a civilised fashion. “Unfortunately, the language in Westminster politics is not improving because, as I write this blog, the deputy leader of the Labour Part, Angela Rayner has just called the Tories ‘scum’. Not much progress there. “When I was First Minister of Northern Ireland I shared an office with the deputy First Minister, firstly Martin McGuiness and then Michelle O’Neill. “Both were steeped in Irish republicanism.“In McGuinness’ case he was a self-confessed member of the IRA and responsible for a number of atrocities in the s and s. “For many in NI they could not understand how I could even bear to be in the same room never mind share an office. “For me it was about trying to secure a better Northern Ireland for the future and that meant not ignoring their beliefs or history, far from it, but trying to disagree well. “In other words, recognising where there was common ground and building on that, and trying to deal with areas where we had fundamental dferences in a way that did not do damage to the system of government given to us by the Belfast Agreement. “In other words, I was trying to show that politics worked not the alternative which I had grown up with.“For NI politics to be successful however both sides have to want it to work and I’m not sure that’s the case in Northern Ireland with Sinn Fein pushing for constitutional change whatever the cost to our citizens. “In today’s social media world of politics not even subtle points are lost in translation. I really regret that. “Yes, your opponents are always going to spin your point of view to suit their agenda, but  characters is not enough space for a political argument to be put forward, never mind digested and contradicted. “The main stream broadcasters are becoming just as bad with their soundbite headlines.“Say something outrageous in Parliament and you will be on the  o’clock news. “Develop a political argument in a thoughtful way and try to persuade others of your point of view and it will not make the cut.“Is this the political discussion we want or need  “Of all places in the world Northern Ireland needs nuance and understanding in its politics and none of the social media s allow that to happen. “We need a little less Twitter and a lot more thought and direct conversation. There may then be a little less outrage – I can but hope. “So, in answer to the question: ‘What are you going to do next ’, the answer is partly at least to try and ensure there is a space for civil debate without the drama and sometimes the hatred which is all too often a mark of social media. “AF.”The ExtraORDINARY Women exhibition is open from Monday and runs until December .It is comprised of both online testimoniesand physical artefacts.The library will host an in-person and online celebration on Monday, November .To watch, go to this link: vimeo event For more, click here: ‘What school grades do I need to join PSNI – and how much will I earn ’Click here: Date is set for massive Orange centenary parade in Northern Ireland – akin to ’s vast Ulster Covenant march——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularArlene Foster: Martin McGuinness was behind a number of IRA atrocities right into the sUUP leader Doug Beattie rebukes Michael D Higgins over ‘myth’ of why Irish join British armed forces‘Economic united Ireland grows before our eyes’ as Protocol negotiations drag onFrosses Road crash victim named by police as curate’s we Aurelia Kelly from BallymenaTwo-thirds of NI voters support remaining in UK – but health a main priority: SurveyMost Popular‘UVF leadership concerned about the protocol... but they did not order rioting’Prof Jon Tonge’s survey of all polls show only % support for a united Ireland and over % support for the UnionProtestant church leaders did not want to contradict Archbishop Eamon MartinLetter: Unionists must not become latter-day Vichy collaborators over protocolSDLP MLA Dolores Kelly urged to apologise for branding RUC ‘sectarian’                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

Photo: PacemakerUpper Bann MLA Mrs Kelly was quoted in a newspaper article as saying this week’s PSNI th anniversary was the perfect opportunity to recommit to the principle of a shared police force. The SDLP policing board member also said the creation of the PSNI was a “signicant departure from the institutionalised sectarianism represented by the RUC”.Those comments led to the NI Retired Police Officers’ Association penning an open letter to Mrs Kelly, in which the NIRPOA chairman called on the MLA to withdraw her remarks, and to apologise for the “gross offence” caused.The letter states: “I am writing to seek your immediate withdrawal of that remark, and an apology for the gross offence you have caused to the thousands of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC who served this community in the most challenging of times.”Mrs Kelly responded, saying: “The SDLP has previously paid tribute to the sacrices made by many RUC officers and their families.“The fact remains that there were severe institutional problems within the RUC and this is a matter of public record. That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Most PopularRoad repairs branded ‘diabolical’Mike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC commentsPSNI spend  minutes ‘holding’ person sitting on Bann River Bridge in PortadownNigel Dawson appointed District Master of Portadown LOL No‘Viable device’ found by bomb experts during Craigavon security alertMost PopularUpper Bann is in ‘housing crisis’ with current rate of build ‘woefully inadequate’Portadown church hosts charity quiz in aid of TearfundArtists, young and older, exhibiting at Portadown’s Millennium CourtPortadown murder: Shock in rural community after man arrested on suspicion of murderStephen Barriskill killing: PSNI charge -year-old man with murder                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation.

It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
