This was set up by her mother Slavica Ecclestone —Bernie\u0027s former wife — in 1997 and raised £3 billion by selling shares in Formula One.Slavica and her daughters, Tamara and Petra, are the beneficiaries of the trust.The three women have been made so wealthy by the trust that Slavica — who orced Bernie in 2008 — blew £12 million on Petra\u0027s wedding to first husband, James Stunt.And there is nothing that goes down quite so well on Instagram as monumental excess.Tamara habitually shows off the fruits of her unfettered spending on social media, including a lavish £150,000 birthday party in June at which naked cowboys served tequila shots.There was speculation yesterday that her status as the blingiest woman in London might have made her a target for raiders, alerted to her leaving the property hours earlier when she posted pictures of her family aboard a private jet en route to Lapland.But friends insist the robbery is not connected to social media. \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s got anything to do with her posting a picture of getting on a jet,\u0027 said the source.Be that as it may, father Bernie has been repeatedly dismayed by his flashy daughters — and their flashy husbands.The son of a Suffolk trawlerman, the 89-year-old former chief executive of Formula One is a workaholic and has no time for ostentation. His favourite meal remains egg on toast with brown sauce and, when they were growing up, his daughters didn\u0027t have a nanny or housekeeper.Bernie built up his fortune during his 40-year reign over world motorsport. In 2017, U.S. giant Liberty Media completed its £6.4 billion takeover of the sport, and Bernie was appointed chairman emeritus.Over the years, the Ecclestone family has fallen victim to numerous criminals. Bernie was mugged in 2010 on a London street, with £200,000 of jewellery taken.In 2016, his mother-in-law was kidnapped in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but released ten days later without any ransom being paid.Daughter Petra had jewellery worth £450,000 taken in 2013 from her house in Belgravia by a burglar posing as a prospective home buyer. He was later sentenced to eight years in prison.Meanwhile, the men in the lives of Tamara and Petra have also had brushes with the law.Jay Rutland, a former City trader who works for an art gallery, was accused in 2016 of helping a fugitive drugs baron — serious allegations that could have landed him in jail for up to seven years had the charges not been dropped for lack of evidence. Mr Rutland strenuously denied the allegations.         Husband Jay was in a less ecclesiastical mood, opting for a more pointed barb on the social media site which seemed to imply he knew who was behind the raid: \u0027I know u are lying, but continue\u0027 Three days after returning from their honeymoon in June, 2013, he was robbed at knifepoint at a petrol station in East London and had his £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet stolen.Meanwhile, Petra\u0027s first husband James Stunt has been accused by Petra of being a fantasist and an art fraudster. Stunt, from Surrey, is a bullion dealer and art collector and his godfather is Terry Adams, the convicted money launderer and alleged gangster.Now bankrupt, Stunt told police he was the victim of a £90 million heist in his Belgravia home in 2017.But officers closed the investigation months later and no arrests have been made.Last month, open hostilities broke out between Petra — now engaged to former car salesman Sam Palmer — and Stunt.Petra married Stunt in 2011 and they had three children before orcing in 2017.She called Stunt \u0027horrible and narcissistic\u0027, adding: \u0027The man is not a billionaire and never was. Naively, I funded his life for our entire marriage.\u0027She added that Bernie had loaned him £10 million for his \u0027failed gold business\u0027 and said that Stunt \u0027spent most most of his days in bed high on prescription drugs\u0027.She said that he had threatened to kill her and expressed the hope that her unborn baby died of Aids. She added: \u0027The sad reality of it is James is not a gangster . . . he\u0027s just a prat.\u0027Stunt later responded to her accusations, describing them as \u0027falsehoods\u0027. He added: \u0027Petra, it\u0027s very sad that you\u0027ve had to tell so many lies.\u0027One daughter at war with her ex the other heartbroken by theft.As Bernie is no doubt sick and tired of being reminded, money sure can\u0027t buy happiness."},{"url":null,"title":"Rodent slides bird feeder pole home owner covers oil","story":"Share this article The squirrel then pauses for a brief seven seconds before realizing it has been outsmarted and moving away. Following the comical moment, the home owner said: \u0027A squirrel kept climbing up the bird feeder eating all the birdseed so this morning I washed the pole and greased it with canola oil and waited for the squirrel to come back!\u0027         The squirrel launches itself off the garden lawn and manages to pull its body up the pole but soon finds that it can no longer grip the pole         The squirrel slumps back down to the grass and moves away from the pole due to the grease from the vegetable oilAccording to the Royal Society For The Protection Of Birds, there are a number of deterrents home owners can use to ward off gray squirrels such as fixing cones and baffles to the string of a hanging feeder or using vaseline or grease to cover the pole.  Home owners can also dust strong chilli powder or pepper sauce onto the bird food itself in a effort to keep squirrels away. The chilli will not affect birds, who are not bothered by the spice, but will stop squirrels, who are put off by the burning sensation, from getting hold of the stored food in the hanging cage.    "},{"url":null,"title":"Estonia apologises minister describes Finlands new PM Sanna Marin sales girl","story":"Share this article \u0027Now we see how one sales girl has become a prime minister and how some other street activists and non-educated people have also joined the cabinet,\u0027 Helme said on his party\u0027s radio talk show.Last week, Ms Marin became the world\u0027s youngest sitting prime minister and the third woman to lead Finland\u0027s government.Estonian president Kersti Kaljulaid called her Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto, offering a public apology on behalf of Estonia and Mr Helme to Ms Marin and her government.

The Vatican had long insisted that such confidentiality was necessary to protect the privacy of the victim, the reputation of the accused and the integrity of the canonical process.However, such secrecy also served to keep the scandal hidden, to prevent law enforcement from accessing documents and to silence victims, many of whom often believed that \u0027pontifical secret\u0027 prevented them from going to the police to report their priestly abusers.While the Vatican has long tried to insist this is not the case, it has never mandated that bishops and religious superiors report sex crimes to police, and in the past has encouraged bishops not to do so.According to the new instruction, which was signed by the Vatican secretary of state but authorised by the pope, the Vatican still does not mandate reporting the crimes to police, saying religious superiors are obliged to do so where civil reporting laws require it.But it goes further than the Vatican has gone before, saying: \u0027Office confidentiality shall not prevent the fulfilment of the obligations laid down in all places by civil laws, including any reporting obligations, and the execution of enforceable requests of civil judicial authorities.\u0027         Worshipers hold Christmas crib figures of the Christ Child during the Pope\u0027s weekly Angelus prayer on December 8, 2019 at St. Peter\u0027s Square the Vatican. Such secrecy also served to keep the scandal hidden, to prevent law enforcement from accessing documents and to silence victimsThe Vatican has been under increasing pressure to cooperate more with law enforcement, and its failure to do so has resulted in unprecedented raids in recent years on diocesan chanceries by police from Belgium to Texas and Chile.But even under the penalty of subpoenas and raids, bishops have sometimes felt compelled to withhold canonical proceedings given the \u0027pontifical secret\u0027, unless given permission to hand documents over by the Vatican. The new law means this explicit permission is no longer required.Inidual scandals, national inquiries, grand jury investigations, UN denunciations and increasingly costly civil litigation have devastated the Catholic hierarchy\u0027s credibility across the globe, and Francis\u0027 own failures and missteps on the issue have emboldened his critics.In February, he summoned the presidents of bishops conferences from around the globe to a four-day summit on preventing abuse, where several speakers called for a reform of the pontifical secret.Francis himself said he intended to raise the age for which pornography was considered child porn. "},{"url":null,"title":"Milestones parenthood retirement coming later life figures show","story":"Share this article Researchers said this was a knock-on effect from the long-term rise in the average age of parenthood.The average age of first-time mothers is now 29, two-and-a-half years later than in 1999, with the gap between having a second child shrinking over recent decades to now just over two years.         This graph illustrates how some women are thought to be delaying having children, with reasons including more women remaining in full-time education couples forming later and becoming more financially stable before having children          The average gap between first and second children has reduced over the last two decades and is now at just over two years          In 1999, people in their mid-30s and 40s earned the most, with 47-year-olds earning £12.25 per hour, after taking inflation into account. In 2019, 41-year-old employees received the highest average hourly earnings, at £14.83 per hour         The ages of highest earnings for men and women are now three years apart, with women\u0027s earnings at their highest at 41 years. This is compared to 1999 when the gap was a far bigger 19 years - with women at 29 and men at 48A second child is also likely to be a woman\u0027s last, with women in England and Wales who turned 45 in 2018 having an average of 1.89 children – the joint-lowest figure since records began.Only a quarter (26 per cent) of these women had three or more children, with the number of women with none or just one child increasing over time.The ONS found that the average age of orce for opposite-sex couples in 2018 was 46.9 years old for men and 44.5 years old for women, more than six years higher than 20 years ago.This could be a result of the trend of people getting married later in life and staying married for longer, researchers said.           In 2018, the average age at orce for opposite-sex couples in England and Wales was 46.9 years for men and 44.5 years for women. This is more than six years higher than it was for both sexes 20 years ago, the ONS data has revealed         In 2018, the median duration of marriage before orce for couples was 12.5 years - the longest since records began in 1963         Around 12 per cent of the UK population provide informal or unpaid care to family members, friends, neighbours or others because of long-term illness, disability or problems related to old age. These figures are according to the 2011 census         Men are more likely to care for their partner, but women are more likely to provide care to people in a different householdIn England and Wales in 2018, the median length of an opposite-sex marriage before orce was 12.5 years, the longest duration since records began in 1963.In 2016, the average age for remarriage for orced men and women in the UK was 50.4 and 47.4 years old respectively – eight years older than in 1998.The ONS said the age of employees with the highest average earnings has fluctuated in recent decades, with 41-year-olds earning a peak of £14.83 per hour in 2019.In 1999, it was 47-year-olds earning the most on average, while in 2009 it was 34-year-olds.           The average age of parenthood continues to rise, which gives a knock-on effect on grandparents. In 2017 to 2018, the age at which 50 per cent of people had a grandchild living outside their home was 63 – three years later than 2009 to 2010         People are working until later in life than they used to, as shown in the ONS data. Between 1999 and 2019, the average age of someone leaving the labour market increased from 61.7 years to 64.7 years         The convergence shown in the previous graph between the ages of men and women stopping work could be down to changes to the state pension age, which equalised at 65 for both sexes in November last year         After the age at which most people have stopped working, people report some of the highest happiness levels. Between the ages of 65 and 74, both sexes are happier than those in any other age groupResearchers said those with higher salaries in 2019 were likely to have started work before the 2008 financial crisis, which may have impacted on the rate of pay rises for younger generations.Average earnings for older workers tend to tail off in later life, possibly due to high earners retiring early and remaining workers taking up lower-paid part-time roles.Research also showed that people are working later in life than previously. Between 1999 and 2019, the average age for stopping work increased from 61.7 years to 64.7 years.The proportion of people providing care peaks at 56 years old for women and 59 years old for men, data showed.         The Office for National Statistics reveals the main trends over time for personal and economic well-being measures. For example, it shows how real household spending per head and household net financial wealth per head are both on the riseBetween the years ending 2008 and 2018, higher proportions of men aged 60 to 64 and women aged 55 to 59 were providing informal care.Figures also revealed that 40 per cent of female carers and 38 per cent of male carers are looking after a parent.Women take on the greater share of caring until the age of 74, when the proportion of men providing unpaid care becomes greater.This could be because women in this age group are more likely to be widowed than men and their parents have died, researchers said."},{"url":null,"title":"Gay couple accuse TUI ruining honeymoon homophobic cruise ship","story":"Share this article          The couple (above) said they had a private photo shoot away from other guests as staff refused to take pictures of themThe couple have also noticed bar staff laughing and pointing at them as they danced, and Dan added that in some cases they were made to feel as though they were \u0027invisible\u0027 and were not served by some staff.\u0027We have danced with each other and noticed bar staff laughing and also pointing at us.

Witnessing this mega city from the plane is to suddenly realise the immensity of modern China. Roughly 50 million people live in this urban sprawl surrounding Hong Kong.Lianzhou is a four-hour drive from Guangzhou into the forested mountains of Guangdong province. It is perhaps an unlikely destination for a major arts event. But in 2005, Duan Yuting, a 47-year-old former photo editor for a Guangzhou newspaper, chose the city to found the festival, now firmly established as China’s leading contemporary photography event.For its 15th edition, the work of 50 artists from China and around the world can be viewed in a museum and two former industrial spaces in Lianzhou.One of the first exhibitions on show at the Granary venue is Argentinian artist Seba Kurtis’s series Immigration Files. Kurtis grew up in Buenos Aires before, at 27, escaping the Argentinian financial crisis of 2001 for a new life in Europe, only to find more hardship as an illegal immigrant in Tenerife.One of the few things Kurtis brought to Europe was a shoebox of family photographs and Super 8 films, rescued from his grandmother’s home after a flood. Mixed in with the photographs were artworks that Kurtis’ younger sister had created with glitter and glue. The flood had damaged the images, causing the glitter to meld with the emulsion from the photographs. Kurtis set about digitising these precious, distorted images. “I realised I couldn’t see the faces of family members I might never see again,” he says. “The water damage became representative of violence in my later work.”Kurtis, who is now based in Manchester, UK, would spend seven years as an undocumented immigrant on the Canary Islands and mainland Spain. The uncertainty and anxiety of that time, and his memories of the life he left behind in Argentina pervade the images on show at Lianzhou. In them, he returns to the bucolic coastlines of Tenerife and the Canary Islands – the first sight of land countless refugees glimpse as they cling to hazardous rafts crossing the Mediterranean.Evoking his sister’s artworks, Kurtis decorates these photographic landscapes with glitter. But he does so meaningfully as a way to visually illustrate recent sociological surveys detailing suicides, evictions and crimes among refugee communities in the Canary Islands. Aesthetically, he is linking his own history to that of the migrant experience. “The glitter represents my story, my family’s story,” he says.The tolls of migration, the loss of family and the pull of home are felt by many millions of Chinese citizens. These are captured with vivid detail by Chinese artist Qian Haifeng in his portraiture series The Green Train, an exhibition eight years in the making, and also on show at the Granary.“Green trains” are China’s cheapest form of long-distance travel. For the price of one first-class ticket from Shanghai to neighbouring Nanjing, one can travel the entire length of China on a green train. They are typically used by the lowest-income migrants. On the national day of the People’s Republic of China in October, these relics of the Cultural Revolution become the vessels for millions of Chinese migrants to return to their ancestral homelands.In the decade before he became a known photographer, Qian Haifeng was a fellow passenger. He was fascinated by the people with whom he shared such journeys – and never met again. In Lianzhou, he describes the carriages of the green trains as “live stages, where everyone’s lives are on display for others to see, and where everyone present has the potential to play a leading role”.Duan Yuting, the festival’s director, awarded Qian with the Lianzhou Foto festival’s Punctum prize in 2015. “When I gave him the award, many professional Chinese photographers did not like it,” Duan says. “But his most important characteristic is that he’s not an artist. He is just the same as the people on the trains. He lived there with them, and that’s how he related to them. That’s why only he was able to take these photographs.”The forested wilderness surrounding Lianzhou is home to some of the world’s rarest and most elusive animals, including China’s dwindling population of tigers.With this in mind, Swiss photographer Alex Hanimann displays his series Trapped at the Granary. This a collection of photographic portraits of wild animals taken by camera traps at night.Hanimann originally intended the images to be used in a scientific survey. But he realised his camera was capturing these secretive animals at their most expressive and characterful.Hanimann considers these images to be self-portraits – and unconscious selfies. The animals were unaware of the cameras, yet Hanimann saw “a world of small, dramatic happenings, micro-dramas and gestures”.Chinese authorities were present at the festival’s opening and did not take kindly to the work of Jenny Rova. Much of Rova’s exhibition, Älskling, which translates as “sweetheart”, was removed by censors before the public had chance to see it. In doing so, the authorities robbed Lianzhou of the chance to witness a beautiful and intimate example of conceptual portraiture.In 2015, the Swedish photographer, who lives and works in Zürich and combines her artistic practice with her work as a waitress, contacted each of her former partners. She asked them to send her all the images they took of her during their relationship. She ended up with 55 photographs from nine former lovers, revealed to us as Anders, Amir, Jonas, Henning, Étianne, Boran, Johan, Bruno and Dan.Speaking at the festival, Rova describes Älskling as: “My attempt to capture the way we look at each other when we’re in love, from one lover to the next.”Älskling begins in the hills surrounding Uppsala, Sweden, where Rova spent her teenage years, and ends with her facing orce while bringing up her infant son.By making these shared moments public, Rova reveals how different relationships can reveal contrasting, hidden sides of our personalities. The images comment on the role former relationships can play in the present of our lives – “you can sense the identity behind the camera,” she says.Behind the ScarA photographer dealing with memory, sex and the self in a radically ergent way is the Chinese photojournalist Liang Yingfei, who works for Beijing’s Caixin Media. Perhaps more so than any other artform, documentary photography is highly controlled in China, so Liang and her fellow photojournalists must develop creative conceptual techniques to explore their subjects without alerting the authorities.In Lianzhou, Liang tells the stories of sexual abuse survivors. The series, she says, was instigated after a friend was abused by a charity worker on a voluntary trip.After obtaining the trust of survivors of abuse, Liang used her camera to “reconstruct and visualise the recurring traumatic nightmares victims have experienced in the aftermath”. Her images include a slug crawling along a woman’s skin as she sleeps and a doll being held underwater.Resplendent with purple hair, the Shanghai-based photographer Coca Dai has been in trouble with the authorities before. But they allowed the festival to exhibit his compulsive, chronological portraits of his partner, Judy, over the course of their eight years together. The exhibition moves from portraits taken on the day they met, when the couple were still teenagers, through to the birth of their first child and on to the present day. Judy often poses like a conventional model but Coca’s images of her show her asleep, eating, or bathing herself or their child.Much of China remains avowedly patriarchal so unvarnished experiences of Chinese femininity are often hidden from view. Lin Ye, the Chinese curator, says of Coca’s exhibition: “In history, women have always lived under ship of men. They have been disciplined and trained to accept male scrutiny and cater to male standards. This visual mechanism has allowed women to internalise men’s scrutiny on themselves.”Coca’s unflinchingly honest portrayal of Judy, created in the linage of artists such as Nan Goldin and Wolfgang Tillmans, is an inversion of this lineage. These images may be authored by a man but they are a powerful portrait of modern Chinese womanhood. And they point, defiantly, to a more tolerant and hopeful future.For his series Freezing Land, Shanghai-based photographer Chen Ronghui used Kuaishou, or “choir show”, a Chinese social video app comparable to TikTok, to explore the lives of young people living in Fularji. The area was a once prosperous district in the province of Heilongjiang, near the border with North Korea. “Kuaishou is despised by many people in China,” Chen says in Lianzhou. “This is a story of young people getting back the right to express themselves.”The temperature can often drop to -30C (-27.4F) in Fularji, but the economy has frozen, too. “We’re used to thinking of Chinese cities purely in the context of massive growth but Fularji is an exception,” Chen says. Fularji was once China’s most renowned steel town. In the 1960s, it became home to the headquarters of China First Heavy Industries, and more than 15 million immigrants came to the region during Mao’s era. Today, it’s facing a bigger economic recession than anywhere else in China.Chen used Kuaishou to explore the lives of millennials living in the once great town, making contact first with Lin Zi, a 14-year-old who uses a local cafe to stream live performances online. After dropping out of school, Lin has gained almost a million fans. “My parents abandoned me and I make money by doing drag shows on a live streaming app,” Lin told Chen.“The young people I met on Kuaishou all experience a sense of uncertainty,” Chen says. “They face a choice: to leave for challenges in bigger cities or stay behind and embrace their fate. This is a wider story about China the uncertainty about our future, no matter who we are.”• Lianzhou Foto festival 2019 takes place in Lianzhou, China, until 3 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7b6f083a914bc006c643135827c0aa04cb1e99/24_1706_2695_1617/master/2695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=585cb654f980d86357d408c3ba7fb385","title":"top 15 photography books of 2019","story":"Pilgrims, hippies and voyeurs are among the subjects of this year’s most intriguing photo books, while the vivid dissonance of the Indian night conveys an essential truth about our times American photographer Gregory Halpern’s much anticipated follow-up to 2016’s acclaimed ZZYZX, which was a meditation on Los Angeles as a heightened state of mind as much as an actual place. With Omaha Sketchbook, Halpern explores the notion of American masculinity, his setting the midwestern Nebraskan city of the title where fundamentalist Christian values predominate. The book is designed to look like one of his work-in-progress notebooks, while his portraits and landscapes have a sense of suspended time as if the meaning of the place and its people remains somehow elusive despite the deep fascination he feels for them.Originally published on Bastille Day, 1968, by City Lights in San Francisco, On the Barricades is a sturdy zine-type publication that juxtaposes grainy images from the student uprising in Paris that year with the often elliptical situationist slogans that appeared daily on the city’s walls. It makes for an interesting, if surreal, blend of image and text, with lines such as “The smoke of grenades in the meadow of our eyelashes” accompanying photos of stone-throwing students facing off against cops firing teargas. This faithful facsimile from the ever-inventive Mörel books is an artefact from another, more revolutionary, time and a reminder of the impromptu creativity that attended the now distant youth protests of May 68.A complex photobook on every level, American Origami is an exploration of the psychological aftermath of seven American mass school shootings which combines Andres Gonzalez’s own detached, low-key photographs of now familiar towns and communities with a surfeit of statistical and forensic documents. Resembling a packed folder, the book unfolds to reveal a wealth of other related materials: news clippings, handwritten notes, drawings, memorabilia and an inventory of objects that speak of mass grieving. (More than 65,000 teddy bears were sent to Sandy Hook elementary school alone in the wake of the shooting there.) An ambitious attempt at understanding – and visualising – the fallout from a senselessly recurring American tragedy.A single retrospective volume that comprises Irish photographer Eamonn Doyle’s three self-published and now highly collectible photobooks, i, On and End. The first was described by Martin Parr as “the best street photobook in a decade”. Doyle’s often disorienting images of Dublin’s passing strangers are here paired with characteristically surreal prose by the Irish novelist Kevin Barry and the bold design is by the photographer’s longtime collaborator Niall Sweeney. The result adds up to a heady remix of Doyle’s small but vital back catalogue, its iconoclastic spirit more attuned to his parallel career as an electronic music producer and record label boss.A deceptively simple photobook that comprises just 14 portraits of Paul Graham’s elderly mother as she sits in an armchair in a retirement home. The muted colour tones and floral patterns of her clothes, bathed in natural light from a nearby window, seem almost universal in their evocation of old age and fragility. Graham’s point of view remains constant, his camera recording the slightest shifts in mood and expression. An intimate and meditative, but never intrusive, series of portraits that speak quietly of family ties, ageing and encroaching mortality.Peter Watkins was nine years old when his mother took her own life by walking into the sea. His long-term project, The Unforgetting, is part elegy, part meditation on the tides and long shadow of grief. Watkins creates sculptural still lifes from the things left behind, whether an unopened handbag or a cassette tape, each carrying its own secrets and imbued with a talismanic presence. Whether self-portraits or constructed tableaux, his starkly formal images reverberate with a sense of absence. A book about remnants, traces, memories and the unsettling power of photography.Alongside the recently published The Sound I Saw, which gathers Roy DeCarava’s beautifully meditative portraits of jazz performers including John Coltrane and Billie Holiday, Light Break offers a wider perspective on the life and work of a singular, somewhat elusive 20th-century American photographer. A master of often luminous street scenes and quiet, deeply observational portraits, DeCarava is perhaps most well known for Sweet Flypaper of Life, his collaboration with Langston Hughes. This illuminating retrospective shows the full range of his work and the consistency of his vision.The village of Älvdalen, in the west of Sweden, still has its own ancient language, Elfdalian. The place and its people cast a spell on Swedish-born photographer Maja Daniels, who spent her childhood summers there, roaming free in the woods. Her book is a meditation on memory, mystery and belonging that contrasts her own often impressionistic landscapes and portraits with the work of a pioneering local photographer and eccentric, Tenn Lars Persson, who was born there in 1878. It is this visual dialogue between old and new, strange and commonplace, that lends the book its quiet cumulative power.Prefaced by an Emily Dickinson poem – “Tell all the Truth but tell it slant” – Aaron Schuman’s book couples his own wryly revealing photographs (all taken within a 30-mile radius of the poet’s home town of Amherst, Massachusetts) with clippings from the police report section of the local newspaper. To give just one example: “A man shoveling snow on State Street told police he saw a strange orange glow coming from the eastern sky that might have been something on fire. Police determined the glow was probably the sun coming up for the day.” Slant is a witty, deadpan meditation on small-town America that carries a darker undertow in the age of fake news, post-truth politics and alternative facts.Some photobooks stand alone for their subject matter and the audacity of their approach. The Park is a case in point. In the early 1970s, Kohei Yoshiyuki captured the illicit sexual encounters that took place in Tokyo’s parks at night, creeping close to furtive couples and the voyeurs that observed them. His infrared camera lends these clandestine acts another layer of transgression, capturing the desperation and essential loneliness of these fleeting encounters as well as the creepiness of those watching. A compelling if unsettling book, reissued with additional previously unseen images.“The Second Shift is the term given to the hidden shift of housework and childcare primarily carried out by women on top of their paid employment,” writes Irish artist Clare Gallagher in her short introduction to a beautifully designed book of deftly observed images. They evoke the quotidian work rituals of home and family, and her own anger at what is taken for granted. For all that, Gallagher is a quiet photographer, a creator of intimately observed details that can often approach the dreamlike: unwashed laundry overflowing from a basket, a tangle of electrical wires emanating from an extension socket, vegetable peelings, eggshells, food residue soaking in an oven dish. Her images illuminate a domestic grind so familiar and habitual that it all but goes unseen.In 1968, Dennis Stock, best known for his iconic portraits of James Dean, took a five-week road trip through California to document the hippie counterculture of rock festivals, communes and drug-fuelled mind expansion. To the sceptical photographer, California had become a “head lab” for the adventurous and impressionable. The more he travelled, though, the more his fascination grew. His images of hippies, bikers, surfers, protesters and utopian dreamers remain resonant, becoming reflections of a freer, more questioning US bathed in the glow of collective optimism and that fabled California sun.Tomlinson has been acclaimed for her images of contemporary pilgrims in religious sites in France, Poland and Ireland. Ex-Voto gathers her stark monochrome portraits of pilgrims, large format landscapes and mysterious still lifes of offerings left in rocks and trees at Lourdes, Ballyvourney and Grabarka. The results possess a kind of serene calmness that befits the subject matter, her portraits in particular capturing the reverent otherness and simplicity of the devotional life.Close to where he lives in rural Sweden, English photographer Stephen Gill drove a tall wooden stake into the ground near a stream in a flat landscape of spreading fields. On an adjacent wooden pillar, he mounted a motion-sensor camera. From that simple idea, The Pillar was born: a book of photographs of wild birds in close-up, alighting and taking flight, resting, feeding, preening and watching. “I’d never seen birds in this way before,” writes Karl Ove Knausgård in his accompanying essay, “as if on their own terms, as independent creatures with independent lives … and so infinitely alien to us.”An evocation of “the loneliness and suspicion of the Indian night”, The Coast is a vivid, unsettling merging of the fictional and the real. Hura’s free-flowing visual narrative echoes both the overload of social media imagery and the edginess he encountered on unfamiliar Indian streets at night.Playing with ideas of privacy, voyeurism and trust, the young Indian photographer creates an almost hallucinatory world where spectral figures loom out of the enveloping dark, people grapple in the rubble and religious revellers give way to abandonment, their faces daubed with powdered paint.The context is what Hura describes as the “increasing dissonance” of India’s Hindu nationalist politics. The Coast possesses a visual dissonance of its own through his use of unforgiving flash, colour saturation and frequently jarring juxtapositions of the real and the staged. “For me,” says Hura, “the notion of photography as fiction is a given.” For all that, his unreal images convey an essential truth about our turbulent times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d863826d6320ba80e69afb241fda2aacb9448aa/0_0_3366_2020/master/3366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8b63a36730ae9a5029b012f1c36ffcf","title":"pound slides to pre election levels in wake of bid to outlaw brexit extension","story":"Sterling has lost two cents against both the euro and dollar amid City fears of no dealThe pound has given up the gains made since the general election after Boris Johnson said he would write Britain’s exit from the EU next year into law without an extension in the transition period.Sterling tumbled by about two cents against the dollar and the euro on the international money markets, as the decision to enshrine time-limited Brexit negotiations into law caught investors by surprise.The pound came under heavy selling pressure on the foreign exchanges, falling to about $1.31 against the dollar and to about €1.18 against the euro, reversing all the post-election gains made since Thursday evening last week.Johnson’s move set alarm bells ringing in the City, where bosses and investors have largely been anticipating that the year-long Brexit transition period until the end of December 2020 would likely be extended.Should ministers fail to agree a deal by the end of next year, Britain would likely exit the EU and continue a relationship with its most significant trading partner on World Trade Organization terms, a move investors in the City believe would damage the UK economy.The Confederation of British Industry, the country’s leading business lobby group, warned ministers that the speed they were taking to reach an agreement must not compromise quality.It added: “The economy cannot afford another no-deal cliff-edge in December 2020 and needs a deep and ambitious deal that protects the UK services and secures the necessary regulatory cooperation for the industries that need it.”Investors had expected the currency to come under pressure next year as Johnson faces the complex process of striking a far-reaching trade deal with the EU in less than a year. Most international trade deals take much longer to agree.Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the financial trading firm IG, said: “With Johnson introducing yet another needless cliff-edge, he has dented hopes of a sentiment driven boost in economic activity which has in turn put an end to the recent recovery in UK markets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/127d99aa641cc743a1a8d0577294f3f30d007a22/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1de586d2e5cee3ba42496aa38b9631c9","title":"vera lynn stops name being used to market gin in trademark ruling","story":"Dame Vera Lynn has thwarted plans for a “Vera Lynn” gin after a drinks company unsuccessfully argued the name was cockney rhyming slang rather than a reference to the singer.Halewood International, which is behind brands such as Pogues Irish whiskey and Crabbie’s ginger beer, was ordered to pay the famed wartime singer’s £1,800 costs after its attempt to trademark “Vera Lynn” was thrown out.Lynn, 102, had fought the move on the basis it could be considered an endorsement of the products. She has been using her name as an unregistered trademark for music and charity work since 1939.The entertainer’s legal team told the hearing that she was an “extremely well-known singer and performer whose musical recordings and performances have been popular since the second world war. She is also very well-known for her charity work, including with ex-servicemen, disabled children and breast cancer.”“Well-known personalities are known to endorse products, there will inevitably be confusion that the opponent has endorsed the applicant’s products,” they added.The drinks firm’s lawyer, Tom Jones, countered that there would be no confusion despite Lynn’s celebrity. Selling alcoholic beverages, particularly gin, under the name Vera Lynn would be seen as a “play on words and little more”. “This is a use of language with which the buying public are familiar – the names Ruby Murray (for curry), Alan Whickers (for knickers) and Lionel Blair (for nightmare) are all examples,” he told the hearing.Gin buyers were also young, Halewood argued, while the demographic Lynn resonated with was “much older”. Lynn is best-known for hits such as We’ll Meet Again, which came out in 1939 and The White Cliffs of Dover, from 1942. Two years ago she became the first centenarian to have an album in the UK charts. A decade ago she told the  her guilty pleasure was “at 6pm I like to sit down with a glass of wine and a packet of crisps”.However the trademark hearing officer Al Skilton found in favour of Lynn ruling that: “The evidence falls a long way short of showing that the relevant public for alcoholic beverages will, on encountering “Vera Lynn”, see it as a rhyming slang reference for gin, rather than bringing to mind the entertainer Vera Lynn, who has been in the entertainment business for 84 years.”In a statement, Halewood said it had noted the outcome of the case and “will not be pursuing the matter any further”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6e7719694e129a9c798161dfb1fd5d3c6b0a26/0_64_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2bce92d05bd525a4ad26ddc73e444ee","title":"corbyn mcdonnell transformed labour","story":"In the coming days and weeks, Labour and the left must reflect on why we lost on our failures, the challenges that we must face to renew, and the opportunities that we must seize. Simplistic single reasons for the defeat are not credible – Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit, the media – and those peddling them already are interested only in political point-scoring, not rebuilding.While it is only right that we now focus on the future and learn the right lessons from defeat, it is vital that we also remember the inspirational role that Corbyn and John McDonnell played – not just at the top of the party but before 2015. Like so many Labour activists, trade unionists and peace campaigners, I have long been inspired by Corbyn and McDonnell – by their bloody hard work and resilient political principles. For years, they were there: on picket lines, at protests and at political discussions – when the organised left was little more than a dozen people in a room above a pub.As backbenchers, they fought not for position within the party but for what they believed in – because they hated injustice and because they saw it as their responsibility as MPs to give a platform to those marginalised from power. They didn’t care if that meant they were blackballed by the party leadership or vilified by the press. They were there in solidarity, because that’s what their political principles demanded.That’s why Corbyn won that transformative, historic leadership campaign in 2015. Because hundreds of thousands of party members respected his integrity, and all those trade unionists, peace campaigners and activists who had campaigned with him in the face of the powerful and been dismissed, were now inspired that one of their own could be Labour leader.But without the apparatus to wield power in our hands, the Labour left was nowhere near ready for that – let alone to operate in an environment that was intensely hostile and actively trying to displace us. We didn’t have enough MPs we could rely on, or enough bureaucrats (I don’t mean the term pejoratively) capable of effectively running an organisation as large and complex as the Labour party – or even just the leader’s office.Nonetheless, in the time since Corbyn won the Labour leadership and appointed McDonnell as shadow chancellor, they have changed Labour. It became a party comfortable with public ownership and redistributive taxation, and one that spoke confidently about ending austerity, tackling climate change, raising wages and living standards, and investing in public services. It stopped aping the isive rhetoric of “skivers and strivers” and started talking about social security.I am so sorry we weren’t able to get into government. We came so close in 2017, and I really believed we could do it this time. We will all live with that sense of failure. I could hear it in the silence in the office at 10:01pm on Thursday, and I could hear it in the tone of McDonnell’s interview with Andrew Neil shortly after.Although so many people feel despair, I am convinced that the future is brighter. I looked around me at Labour headquarters in the early hours of Friday morning, and again when I dragged myself back in on Friday afternoon after a quick nap. The people I put an arm around – some metaphorically, some because they were inconsolable – are all brilliant, talented young people, who are not just the future of our movement, but the talented present on which a revival will be based.It’s worth thinking about what’s changed for the better since 2015. Before Jeremy became leader I would often be the youngest person at sparsely attended Labour meetings. As I turn 40, it’s reassuring that at the now considerably larger meetings, the median age is often below my own.The left now has thousands of talented organisers, policy people, creatives and yes, bureaucrats who can run things. Jeremy and John made that happen.There’s plenty of time to analyse the structural problems, the personal failures and, more positively, the road to recovery. My own pretty brutal criticisms, which I shared internally in September, were leaked to the Sunday Times. The fact that among a close group of comrades someone shared that memo with the Murdoch press tells its own story of dysfunction.But for now, I just want to say thank you to two of the most principled people I know – Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. They have endured unprecedented attacks, but inspired so many.• Andrew Fisher was the Labour party’s executive director of policy from 2016 to 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629c437153c9612ebea2d68b45562a234a2d2fa0/0_75_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e1eba5e0a036c8b85756ba701a5b47b","title":"football political arsenal ozil wrong side","story":"What is a modern-day hero? I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird recently – now that it has been adapted for theatre and will soon arrive in London’s West End – and realised how much my perspective on the book has changed. Yes, lawyer Atticus Finch chooses to defend an innocent black man in the highly racist environment of the Jim Crow US south. But he also tells his children to remain neutral in the face of bigotry, making sure they empathise with racists by trying to “crawl around in someone else’s skin”.If you see the play you will find that the scriptwriter, Aaron Sorkin, has zoned in on how problematic an assertion that was. There is a more mainstream understanding now – though oppressed minorities have always known it – that attempting to remain “neutral” in the face of abuses is rarely a neutral act.The world of sport, it seems, has not got the memo. Arsenal are the latest football club to fall foul of a reality in which globalisation means access to lucrative new markets, but also access to new problems such as international human rights.Earlier this week, the Arsenal midfielder Mesut Özil echoed highly legitimate claims from multiple groups at the United Nations on the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China. A group of 23 nations, including the US, Canada, Japan and the UK, cited as credible reports of mass detention and numbers of other human rights violations and abuses in the region. The Human Rights Council and Committee on the Elimination of Racism agreed.In other words, allegations about the treatment of Uighur Muslims are hard to dismiss – as China as attempted to do – as “fake news”.In 2017 Fifa and its members – including the Football Association – publicly stated its adherence to global human rights standards. So you might think that inidual players would find themselves on relatively safe territory here. But no. Arsenal quickly hung their player out to dry for his tweet, attempting a dodgy claim at neutrality. “The content published is Özil’s personal opinion,” the club said in a statement. “As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.”Never mind that, by issuing a statement claiming not to comment on human rights abuses, Arsenal are quite obviously involving themselves in politics – the wrong side of politics.It’s easy to see why. The broadcast rights for the Premier League in China alone are worth £560m a year. Opportunities from Chinese investors are enormous – as Manchester City, Manchester United, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth have already discovered. And the entire Premier League is reportedly anxious about the Chinese state broadcaster scrapping coverage of the Arsenal match last weekend after Özil’s comments.Özil will have known that he would take a personal hit to his 4 million Chinese social media fans too, some of whom are reportedly burning his shirts. But he spoke out anyway.The greatest sports icons always take a stand when they see an injustice. Born in the 1980s, I know about the 1968 Mexico City Olympics not because of the performances per se, but because medallists Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in a black power salute. When I think of Muhammad Ali as “the greatest”, it’s because of his defiance, refusing conscription to Vietnam in a move that was devastating for his career but in hindsight quite clearly on the right side of history. When I talked to Sorkin about why he had felt the need to update the character of Finch, he cited the NFL star Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand during the US national anthem in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. Özil may not be in their league. His affection for Turkey’s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – who was best man at Özil’s recent wedding – is inconvenient to say the least. But you can be critical of his stance on Turkey at the same time as lauding his courage in speaking out over China.The real hypocrisy here is that of sports clubs who claim to be about neutrality – or, as we are sometimes patronised with hearing, “peace” – when in fact the issue at stake is quite transparently one of profit. Why else would Arsenal be relaxed about one of its players violating its “no politics” policy in the UK – as its fallback Héctor Bellerín did with a #FuckBoris tweet to his 1.8 million followers on election day – while panicking over a far less subjective missive from Özil?And we only know clubs actually have the capacity to act quickly in the face of racism because of their lightning responses when anti-Chinese slurs are in evidence. Compare, for example, Chelsea’s swift response when its winger, Robert Kenedy, used racist language in China. He was sent home from a pre-season tour. In contrast, when Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva posted a racist tweet against a fellow teammate, the club’s manager, Pep Guardiola, defended the player. The ensuing double standards are more damaging to football’s world image than some inconvenient truths uttered by a controversial player. If football clubs were capable of genuine strategic long-term thinking, and had a sprinkling of integrity, they would realise it might actually pay to back these players. Because the truth is, we all have skin in this game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aa8837e584ec86804152699727814493168a453/0_0_3171_1903/master/3171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d3c2873c0f382a0a746712c52ea29b8","title":"red wall labour south","story":"When everyone is looking one way, in politics sometimes it pays to look the other way.And that’s what makes the towns that absolutely nobody is talking about in the wake of this election – Swindon and Reading, Watford and Milton Keynes, and Hastings and Rye – fascinating. For perfectly legitimate reasons it’s the collapse of Labour’s ancient northern and Welsh citadels that have captured the imagination in the past few days but, while it’s clearly crucial for Labour to rebuild its so-called “red wall”, that’s only half the story. Even if the party’s next leader could magically recover every one of those lost seats next time, he or she still won’t win a majority without also claiming those southern marginals through which the path to power in the UK invariably runs. And in those seats, which only two years ago looked unexpectedly ripe for the taking, it just made a big leap backwards.Two years ago, Labour advanced to within a couple of thousand votes of knocking out the Tories in a string of southern marginals in theory, one more heave should have got them over the line. Yet time and time again, the opposite happened. Labour lost ground, in some cases against all the odds – as in hyper-marginal Hastings and Rye, where Amber Rudd clung on by her fingernails in 2017 before resigning the Tory whip and being replaced by a candidate now under investigation for sharing an antisemitic video – while the Tories and the smaller parties gained it. If the left’s only answer to this is arguing that the Lib Dems and Greens ruined everything by daring to exist in the same seats as them, rather than wondering why so many non-Tory voters still couldn’t bring themselves to back the obvious anti-Tory choice, then it stands every chance of going further backwards next time.Having watched a startling number of orange signs sprouting this time in villages that are normally solid blue, I understand why. Around here, the Lib Dems classically attract socially liberal soft Tories unhappy about Brexit if anything, it’s the Conservative vote they’re generally splitting, and without them Buckland’s majority could easily have been bigger. These are voters who rejected Jeremy Corbyn, and any Labour recovery depends on facing up to why they did so, not scolding them for it.Many of these southern marginal voters have no great love for Tory governments, yet this time they recoiled both from Corbyn personally – something obvious from polling long before the election – and from an overstuffed manifesto that simply didn’t sound credible to them. So far, so familiar. But a narrative blaming billionaires for rigging the system against the downtrodden masses may also have backfired: in many communities there are no billionaires, while most people don’t self-identify as victims even in tough times or expect their leaders to do so. Any analysis of Labour’s failure that sounds even remotely self-pitying, blaming a hostile media or rival parties for ruining their chances, will only further turn off voters who long to hear practical solutions to practical problems from a confident, optimistic leader.When I asked Church who would go down well in South Swindon she described a social democrat rather than a hardcore socialist: “Someone who comes across as credible, hard-nosed, centre left,” – free from the baggage of the past, with a vision for 21st-century socialism which includes aspirational voters and homeowners too.And yes, of course that’s easier said than done. But there will be no easy answers for a party that has now lost four elections in a row and has behaved for too long as if anti-Tory voters simply had a moral obligation to vote for them, trumping their own responsibility for confronting any shortcomings. If anti-Tory votes have leaked away to smaller parties, the answer is not to demand some kind of political monopoly in which all Labour’s smaller competitors helpfully step aside but for Labour to make itself competitive again. Only by learning from this defeat in every part of the country can it once again start chasing votes that may be more ripe for the taking than we think."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/736c6569eef8a2a0673bbf287838cfaef6a924b2/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a5564804e56f483aacfa705b8d580a","title":"the guardian view on a workers party the country needs one","story":"Boris Johnson will have to do more than steal Labour’s clothes. He must wear them with prideThe prime minister has two flagship policies to address the faults of the current economic model, which the Tory party unleashed on Britain in 1979, funnelling rewards from the economy away from workers. Both raising the national minimum wage and directing billions of pounds of investment into left-behind Britain ought to be welcomed. One can argue that they may not be enough or that the effect will not be felt anytime soon, but they are small steps in the right direction.With unemployment at a record low, workers ought to expect to see rising wages. However, the rise of zero-hour contracts, casualisation and underemployment means that wage pressure is no longer driven by unemployment or the lack of it alone. There is also a painful puzzle here. As technology advances, we should see improvements in the amount of value created by each hour of work. Technology has improved but the condition of workers has not. Economically the UK is two countries – a wealthy one ning London and the south-east and a poorer one outside it.Mr Johnson will have to do more than steal Labour’s clothes. He must wear them with pride. Britain needs an industrial strategy, not least to transition to a low-carbon economy. The Treasury needs to build a culture of government activism. History suggests that economic growth is not spurred on by reducing top tax rates. The only thing that has risen is inequality – to damagingly high levels. The rich have raced away from the rest of society. This has contributed to ordinary voters feeling abandoned and has fuelled the rise of xenophobia. Brexit may have been the outcome but the reasons for the decline in working conditions, wages and public spending can be attributed to an economic policy that failed. Mr Johnson has a chance to fix it. For the country’s sake, one can only hope he takes it.

He didn’t get a present last Christmas and it is unlikely he will get one this year, because his mother struggles just to put food on the table. But it is not all gloom for the lively eight-year-old. Next Monday, 23 December, his school will reopen and the teachers and support staff will return, unpaid, to organise a huge “Christmas Eve Eve” party for the 350 pupils and their families. Kitchen staff will serve 800 Christmas dinners and each child will see Santa and get to unwrap a present bought by the school with money donated by businesses.“We’re having unicorns and that’s what I’m looking forward to, as well as Santa and the dancing,” he says.Chris Dyson, its headteacher, says Christmas can be a confusing time for some children. “They see everyone making Santa lists and yet they don’t get anything they asked for,” he says. “We have children here who don’t get a present at Christmas or on their birthdays. When I came here five years ago I found very few children had been to see Santa. It broke my heart. I wanted to give them a dream, a hope, and show how invested I am in them, even in holiday times.” Over in Blackpool, Stephen Tierney, executive director of a small multi-academy trust consisting of St Mary’s, a Catholic secondary school, and two primary schools, Christ the King and St Cuthbert’s, says schools have become “the fourth emergency service” for families in crisis – because there is nothing else. The trust’s primary schools will open for five days during the Christmas break to provide shelter, food and warmth for vulnerable pupils. This week they are giving out hampers, funded by a charity appeal.“A decade ago schools wouldn’t have had to do it, but we have had 10 years of austerity. There are consequences for those at the bottom who are bearing the brunt,” he says.“It’s heartbreaking for some of our families. Children are going back to homes with no carpets, no heating, no food in the fridge, the place is cold, it is not in great repair, and Christmas will be about surviving. We were thinking of providing the ingredients for a Christmas lunch – but then some homes won’t have enough money for fuel to cook it and some don’t even have an oven.“Heads in Blackpool will tell you stories of family after family who make it clear there is no money for Christmas presents this year and there were no presents last year,” he says. “It is hard to comprehend the hopelessness these parents feel. That is where schools come in. Should we have to? No, but if we don’t, then who will?”Tierney’s staff are volunteering to come in without pay, and local organisations are providing food at no cost. Unless children get help, “what will they eat this Christmas?” he asks.“The boxes will be going out and they are not what you would expect in a Christmas hamper – they will have staples such as pasta and rice and tinned tomatoes, because Christmas is survival for these families, not a bonus.”Back in Leeds, the most expensive gifts are matched to those most in need. The reality of survival on the Seacroft estate kicks in, however. “The last three bikes we gave away ended up on eBay within hours,” says Dyson sadly.Families living in poverty are more likely to suffer breakdown, ill health and mental health issues, but headteachers in more affluent areas of the country say they, too, are having to provide welfare services that were once supplied by local authorities and the health service. “We are a typical comprehensive school in terms of socio-economic profile and ability intake and we are seeing a big increase in challenging behaviour and students with emotional health issues coming up from primary school,” he says.“It’s partly to do with changes in society but also because of the loss of help and support from local authorities. We are coping with challenges around anxiety about school, as the curriculum has become more academic, plus pressures from home. That manifests in a higher level of eating disorders and self-harm.” Fairer funding is top of Antiss’s Santa wishlist, as he struggles to afford enough specialist teachers and is having to cut down on teaching assistant numbers. Schools in West Sussex are the 10th-worst funded of England’s 152 local education authorities, because of a per-pupil funding formula that awards pupils more in some authorities than in others.Phillip Potter, head of Oak Grove college, a special school for 11- to 19-year-olds in Worthing, West Sussex, says funding to provide higher salaries for teaching assistants, the “unsung heroes” of special education, is at the top of his letter to Santa.He says he is struggling to buy essential mobility equipment for his high-needs students. “My dream for 2020 is that the high-needs block will be funded properly and there will be an integrated health, social care and education system to deliver joined-up services for our most vulnerable youngsters, without having to have arguments about who will pay and take things to what feels like 400 panels to get agreement,” he says.While headteachers all have a long list for Santa, they are likely to agree on one thing. “Every teacher’s dream is that politicians keep out of education,” says Potter. “We don’t tell doctors how to do heart surgery, so let 2020 be the year that politicians stop telling us how to teach and give us the resources.”Back at Dyson’s school in Leeds, money is not the problem, however. “I raised £350,000 last year from businesses and have just secured £150,000 to open the school at February half term, and in the Easter and summer holidays,” he says.Through the extra funds he has been able to employ more teaching assistants to give one-to-one support to the most vulnerable students, reduce class sizes and buy in support from specialists for conditions such as dyslexia. He has concerns about what is happening in education generally, however, particularly over discipline and the number of children other schools are excluding. When he arrived at Parklands, more than 150 children a year were being excluded now it is down to one – and that is one too many for Dyson.“I’ve started to take children excluded from other schools to give them a chance,” he says. “I’ve built this school on love. I’ve banned teachers shouting at children, I’ve got rid of the dreaded padded isolation cell, played music and given children respect.”He is concerned about the current “warm-strict” approach to discipline coming from the Department for Education and its behaviour tsar, Tom Bennett, who has defended a “zero-tolerance” approach to behaviour and the creation of centralised detention systems and internal inclusion units.“That way of thinking is that the only way to sort out discipline is to exclude them, to put them in isolation, ban them and put them in boot camps. No! You can do it another way,” Dyson says. “‘Warm-strict’ is having lots of rules but trying to put a warm spin on it by saying that as long as your discipline is strong and tough, you can afford to smile at children.” Dyson, a father of three, says he is not afraid to hug children. “We are a huggy school if children are upset we give them a hug.” The school is a happy place where children are allowed to wear trainers and joggers, and are not told how to wear their hair. Travis, a pupil excluded from another primary school for violence, appears now to be a model student. “Don’t run in the corridor because you might knock over someone who is disabled,” he warns some younger students. “Open the door for visitors,” he tells a girl who pushes past. He then rushes off to comfort a boy in his class who has suddenly broken down in tears in the corridor.“At my other school I used to get into fights and they put me in isolation,” he says. “It was come into school, go into isolation, come into school, go into isolation, come into school, go into isolation. Every day. When I came here, Mr Dyson spent a lot of money on me – £150 I think – to get me help for dyslexia three times a week and I really like it here. It’s magic.”Children’s names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9594b395a267ac770b784141af196d423463f0c2/110_56_4024_2414/master/4024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ece09e8677e22a0c848427fe89777d71","title":"kitchen aide making first ever christmas dinner help","story":"Prep the day before, make a list, don’t overcomplicate things – and go easy on the booze until the food is on the tableI’ve volunteered to cook Christmas dinner, but I’ve only ever made one roast before. Help, please! Ellen, Darlington, County Durham“All the TV chefs tell us to stay calm,” says Heath Ball, landlord of award-winning pub The Red Lion \u0026amp Sun in Highgate, north London, “but the reality is, Ellen will be feeling like an England rugby fullback with the entire South Africa pack bearing down on her, so a bit of panic is kind of inevitable.”Not that that’s necessarily a bad thing, Ball adds, because it keeps you on your toes. Even though this is, in essence, only a glorified roast dinner, it’s by far the most important one of the year. “So take it easy on Christmas Eve, and don’t e into the champagne too early on Christmas morning. There’ll be plenty of time for that once the food’s on the table. In fact, once your job is done, I’d rather hope people will start to bring the drinks to you.”Get organised, too, says James Rix, chefowner of The Fox \u0026amp Hounds in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, a perennial runner-up in Observer Food Monthly’s best Sunday lunch award. “First things first, make a to-do list, starting with the time you want to serve and working back from there. There’s a reason many chefs write lists: it gives you control. I still do one for the next day every night after service, and then rewrite it the next morning.”And don’t overcomplicate things, adds Rix, who in a former life was head chef at Alastair Little in Soho. “Don’t be daft and try to make 20 vegetable sides. Stick to the traditional basics – roast potatoes, roast carrots and parsnips, sprouts, cabbage. No one will judge you for it.” Both Rix and Ball say you’d be surprised quite how much you can get done the day before: parboil the spuds for roasting, prep the root veg, blanch and refresh any green veg – all you have to do to those on the day is dunk them in boiling water at the last minute, to heat through, though being a la-di-da chef type, Rix sautees his greens in excessive amounts of butter afterwards.Rix’s main tip, though, is: “Don’t buy a whole turkey it’ll take up the whole oven, and even experienced cooks find it hard to get the breast and legs to cook evenly.” Instead, get a crown or a boned and rolled breast and, if brown meat’s your thing, a stuffed leg or two, too. “You’ll save yourself a world of pain, and it takes an hour and a half to cook, rather than four or more.” The joint will then happily rest for an hour, giving you plenty of time to finish the veg and gravy. (Speaking of gravy, Rix says there’s no sin in buying it in, provided it’s decent quality – “Marks \u0026amp Sparks do a particularly good chicken one,” he says, “though there are other brands out there. Deglaze the roasting tin with white wine, as usual, stir in the gravy and you’re in business.”)Stosie Madi, who rules the roasts at The Parker’s Arms in Newton-in-Bowland, near Clitheroe, Lancashire, meanwhile, says novice roast dinner cook Ellen should abandon the troublesome turkey entirely and make something a lot more manageable instead. “Slow-roast beef is very forgiving,” she says, “because the oven does all the work for you.” Opt for a topside or brisket joint with a good layer of fat tied on. “Any butcher will sort that for you if they’re any cop, they’ll also give you advice on how to cook it.”The trick, Madi says, is in the marinade and the browning. Get those right, and you’ll be in for a relatively stress-free day, secure in the knowledge that there’s nothing going awry inside that oven. “Leave the joint overnight in a dry marinade of flavours you like: garlic, thyme, parsley, bay, peppercorns are especially good with beef. And don’t add any salt until you’re about to roast it.” In the morning, brown it all over in butter and oil (the oil stops the butter burning). “Don’t be shy: this is where a lot of the flavour comes from.”Pop it in a thick-based pot, ring with your veg of choice – shallots or red onions, carrots and a little celery are classic good companions – add stock andor red wine or stout to cover by half, and cook in the middle of a 160C (140C fan) gas 2½ oven for three to four hours, until it’s fork tender, then move to the top of the oven, where it’s hotter, to crisp up the fat. “So long as there’s always enough stock to keep the beef moist, you can’t go wrong.” The bonus, of course, is that this guarantees you bucketloads of that all-important gravy, too.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Whereas the Club World Cup has a passionate following in Latin and South America – as evidenced by the thousands of Flamengo fans who have travelled to the Gulf state from Brazil – it has struggled to generate the same esteem within European football.Klopp believes the decision to stage the competition in the middle of the European season is one factor. He said proposals for an expanded 24-team Club World Cup from the summer of 2021 – days after the Champions League final and potentially clashing with the Nations League, Africa Cup of Nations and the Concacaf Gold Cup – would not help the competition’s prestige.“I can’t talk about respect in England but we are here now and completely focused,” the Liverpool manager said. “If, however, you asked me if there should be a Club World Cup in the middle of our season, I would say no. We are here so, for us, it is the most important competition in the world. But can it be bigger? I don’t know. Fifa plans a team World Cup in the summer but it is the summer when the African competition is playing and others as well.“We have a lot of fans in this part of the world and they watch us in the middle of the night, so it is nice we come closer, but from an organisation point of view they have to talk, because otherwise Fifa say we’ll have a tournament, and Uefa say so will we, and then South America too. And they all think their tournament is most important. You cannot just add on tournaments. It doesn’t work. Fifa doesn’t like I say it – sorry – but it is my opinion and my opinion has to be right sometimes because I think about football all day.”Despite his grievances about the timing of the Club World Cup, Klopp insists the European champions are determined to claim their third trophy of the calendar year. Klopp, whose team won the Uefa Super Cup in August, added: “We don’t fly 3,000 miles not to show up. Is it the biggest cup competition in the world? I don’t know. We represent Liverpool and Europe … We will give our best as always and hopefully you can see that.”James Milner echoed his manager’s view on the importance of the Club World Cup to Liverpool, who were beaten finalists in 1981, 1984 and 2005 in its various guises. The midfielder said: “We don’t want to be remembered as the team who won one major trophy. We want people to remember us as a group and forget which year we won each trophy. If a chance to win a trophy is a distraction then this is a pretty good distraction. This is the trophy the club have not won so it would be nice to have that.”Liverpool’s presence in Qatar has raised more important concerns than the timing of the Club World Cup. The club rejected the five-star hotel it was allocated by Fifa on ethical grounds, after an investigation revealed it was built by migrant workers operating in breach of labour laws and being paid below the minimum wage. Qatar’s record on human rights and treatment of the LGBT community, with homosexuality illegal, has invited further questions on Fifa’s decision to award Qatar the Club World Cup and the World Cup in 2022.Klopp said: “I have an opinion about that as well but this is a real serious thing to talk about and I think the answers should come from people who know more about it. I have to be influential in football but not in politics. People in politics have to be influential. I like you ask the question but I think I am the wrong person to answer.“Everything is organised as it should be. Organising the competition wherever it is in the world, Fifa did that, so the organisers have to think about these things. Athletes shouldn’t. We shouldn’t. We represent Liverpool, we are invited so we should go there. If sportsmen have to make a decision about a competition wherever it is in the world, that is not right. My personal opinion about homosexuality and all these things, I have one of course: I think we should all be treated equally. That is clear. We don’t have the time to judge things when we are here – we only have time for training.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e80b4b333bc82ec139e2fd81896468b2818469c/211_275_2020_1212/master/2020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=544935522437ccef76d3c9555db68c92","title":"mikel arteta arsenal talks manchester city pep guardiola travel carabao cup oxford","story":"Pep Guardiola has confirmed Mikel Arteta is talking to Arsenal with the clubs’ knowledge and permission, but says he expects his assistant to be involved in Manchester City’s Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday.“At the moment Mikel is still with us, he has been working in training and as far as I know he will be travelling with us to Oxford,” the City manager said. “He’s talking with Arsenal, and I don’t know what will happen and when, but Mikel is an incredible person. We were so smart to pick him up and now the others want him I’m not surprised.“He’s a good manager, that’s why he’s done well with us.

Mikel has been very honest with me all through this situation, but for now he’s still a member of the City staff and part of our group.”Guardiola knows Oxford from playing them last season and describes City’s next game as an important chance to reach another semi-final, though Carabao Cup matters were put into perspective on Monday when the Champions League last-16 draw paired the former Barcelona manager with Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid.“It will be an incredible test for us but we have two months to prepare for it,” Guardiola said. “Hopefully we will be in a good moment in February and we can play a good two games. Real Madrid have a lot more experience than us in this situation, they have played this sort of game many more times, but of course I have confidence in my players.“We are happy just to be in the last 16 of the competition even if people think that’s not enough. If you want to do well in this competition, to progress further than that, then of course you have to face this sort of opponent sooner or later.”Guardiola confessed to holding Zidane in the highest regard from his playing days, and revealed that at one time he thought it might be possible to play in the same team, possibly in Italy. “That never happened but I used to dream of playing with Zidane,” he said. “He was an incredible player, and he’s an incredible person.

There are even templates for sextingThey call him Mr Buy-In. After Tessa Rowe, a recruitment worker from Bristol, went on an underwhelming second date with Aaron (not his real name) – they had been set up by friends – he walked her home and asked if she would like to meet up again. Rowe declined.“He put his foot in my front door,” says Rowe, 33, laughing, “and said: ‘What’s wrong? I’m not getting the same buy-in as I did the first time around.’” Inevitably, Mr Buy-In became a legend in Rowe’s friendship group.How have we got to the point where we describe our personal relationships in language more befitting a corporate boardroom? It is not enough to hang out with friends: we schedule our meet-ups with the precision of a world leader at Davos, and even less joie de vivre. I’m at capacity right now, we intone solemnly to someone asking if we fancy a drink. How about we touch base in a few weeks, when I have more bandwidth?The most extreme example of how corporate jargon has infected our personal relationships is the emerging trend of friendship template texts. First seen in a now viral and much-maligned Twitter thread from the American writer and activist Melissa A Fabello, template texts are generic responses you can send to that friend in crisis you don’t want to talk to. “Hey!” reads Fabello’s suggested response to a friend asking for support. “I’m so glad you reached out. I’m actually at capacity  helping someone else who’s in crisis  dealing with some personal stuff right now, and I don’t think I can hold appropriate space for you.”“It’s about self-optimisation,” explains Prof André Spicer of the Cass Business School, the co-author of Desperately Seeking Wellness, an exploration of the wellness industry. He situates template texts within the broader rise of wellness culture, and with it the drive towards a better, optimised self. “How can you become perfect in your relationships? By going with canned scripts, you come up with what you think is a perfect response to something.”This fashionably optimised self also attends therapy regularly – therapy attendance rates rocketed in the late 90s and 00s – and is unabashed about applying its terminology to everyday life. By using pseudo-therapeutic language such as “holding space”, template text-writers signal that they are emotionally intelligent, savvy and respectful of other people’s boundaries. Ironically, such texts may have unintended negative effects.To someone in crisis, being on the receiving end of a template text could feel devastating. “If someone had sent me that message, I would have felt completely rejected,” says 27-year-old Anwen Hayward, a student from Cardiff. She suffered four bereavements earlier this year, and there have been many moments where she has reached out for support. “Often a fumbling response to a friend in need is far better,” Spicer explains, “because humans don’t always know how to respond a lot of the time.”There is also a performative element to template texts, which are usually shared online by right-thinking activists. “We look to social media and these canned messages to see what being a good friend looks like,” says Spicer. As such, they feed into the broader performance of online selfhood that Jia Tolentino wrote persuasively about in Trick Mirror. “The internet is defined by a built-in performance incentive … the main purpose of this communication is to make yourself look good.”Template texts represent the convergence of two forces – the drive towards optimisation and corporate culture. “The boundaries between work and life have become blurred,” says Spicer. “We’re encouraged to think about growing our human capital and see our personal relationships as if they are an economic enterprise to be carefully managed.” Hence the liberal use of corporate and therapy buzzwords such as “capacity”, “connecting”, and “emotional labour” in template texts.Emotional labour as a concept has been hugely distorted – when coined by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild in 1983, it referred to the onerous burden placed on service workers to appear happy at all times. In general, being a friend to someone is not emotional labour. If you think it is, you’re probably the one who is really hard work. “Twitter is a cesspool for this,” says Hayward. “One person misuses a term and it gets misused over and over again.” She chafes at the idea that friendship is a form of work. “Emotional labour isn’t having to text a friend. The term has been devalued. You could argue that every interaction is emotional labour because it expends work on your behalf. But that’s not what it is.”Why do we view friendships as if they are businesses to be maintained? Because as work has swelled to impinge on every aspect of our lives, each hour is a tiny unit of productivity to be carefully allocated. “These texts are the product of the increasing neoliberalisation of our world, where market metrics have colonised every dimension of our lives,” explains Dr Catherine Rottenberg, an expert in neoliberalism at the University of Nottingham. “Human beings are remade as specks of capital so that our relationship to ourselves and others becomes one of capital appreciation. Our relationships are perceived as forms of capital that need to be invested wisely in order to enhance the self’s overall value.”As our relationships with other people become transactional, dating is reconfigured as a business venture – hence Mr Buy-In. Capitalism has loosened the ties that once bound people to an unprecedented extent. Communities are ripped apart by gentrification deregulation and the erosion of workplace rights mean that we work longer hours in insecure employment for lower pay. “Neoliberalism has created a careless reality,” Rottenberg says. As people become estranged from each other, we reach for template texts to instruct us how to be empathetic, understanding human beings. “Our world – digitally mediated, utterly consumed by capitalism – makes communication about morality very easy but makes actual moral living very hard,” writes Tolentino in Trick Mirror.While it is easy to sneer at template messages, or view them as uncaring, we use scripts in our daily lives without even realising. “Much of everyday interaction is scripted anyway,” says Spicer. “These texts are an example of the informal scripts we learn over time becoming formalised and manufactured.” He emphasises that scripts can be helpful when people are in anxiety-provoking situations, and don’t know what to say.“I was irritated when I saw people mocking scripts,” says 24-year-old Kal Walters, from Idaho. In addition to working with autistic people as a care worker, Walters is on the spectrum, and their brother is also autistic. “Scripts help me navigate social situations where other people would intuitively pick up cues from other people and know how to respond,” Walters says. “Whereas I have to rely on a cheat sheet.” For someone with autism, scripts are a helpful way to navigate the bewildering maze of social interaction. “I don’t understand why people think it’s uncaring to use a script,” Walters adds.“For me, it shows that I do care, and I’m trying to accomodate someone else’s expectations and do the right thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaffb02cd3a86b446da838242de24959b2b57958/0_141_3704_2222/master/3704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4334d3bf17cdfb85692f7a8569911dfd","title":"my mother was dying but my best friend brought happiness to a brutally sad day","story":"The year 2012 had been a long and difficult one. One of three, in fact. It had been three years since my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer and, ever since, I, my dad and older brother had been living in the hospital-filled limbo so familiar to families of cancer patients – life dictated by chemo cycles, the endless bedside waiting, the guilty mental preparation for the inevitable.Christmas in the Kalia household had always been a major occasion, though, and something to look forward to. Even though we are Hindus – our roots are in India – we had embraced the festival’s feasting and gift-giving. My mum would usually invite her two siblings and their ever-expanding families for turkey with all the trimmings, a meal she would spend days preparing while my kitchen-inept dad would look on in awe, faithfully laying the table and clearing dishes. That table would hold at least 15 others, all laughing and stuffing themselves – the usual disagreements that characterised family gatherings strangely absent. Since she had fallen ill, though, Christmas had morphed from a day of celebration of our big immigrant family’s resilient togetherness to a day fearful of absence. Which Christmas would be Mum’s last, I would wonder, and how could I make that one count more than the others?Her last Christmas was December 2012. The cancer had gone into remission in 2011, only to come back nine months later – and this time much worse, requiring major surgery that would keep her in hospital over the Christmas period. I was struggling to come to terms with the news, having just moved out of home to university, where I should have been drinking myself into new friendships, but instead was only thinking about whether she would make it to the end of the year. I was spending my life on trains, coming home every weekend to make the most of the time we had together.December came, and with it the usual stresses of Christmas parties and present-buying. I, for a reason I will never understand, decided to get my mum a copy of Raymond Carver’s What We Talk About When We Talk About Love – an emotionally punishing read at the best of times, never mind after five-hour surgery. It was obvious that we wouldn’t be hosting on Christmas Day this year. Instead, I awoke that morning with fizzing butterflies in my stomach – not the usual excitement, but a rising dread for the day to come, one that I knew I would have to grit my teeth to get through. We went straight to the hospital, where through a tangle of tubes and beneath a wheezing oxygen mask my mum lay, uncomfortable, but happy to see us.I gave her her present – immediately realising it was a useless choice – and then the three of us sat beside her for what felt like hours. There were no decorations in the intensive care ward, no Christmas music, just other families quietly keeping vigil and the heroic staff working through their routines. This was just another day the tantalising magic of Christmas had disappeared.“What are you all looking so sad for?” my mum asked us. She was adamant that we had some semblance of a Christmas Day, so my brother and I were sent off to our auntie’s for a sombre meal, avoiding talk of our mum lest it ruin the charade of turkey, gravy and torn tissue paper hats. My dad wouldn’t leave her side, though, and stayed until the nurses sent him home.It was heart-crushing stuff. “Is this what all Christmases will be like now?” I remember thinking. Yet, as we were leaving my auntie’s to face a night alone in a house that was feeling increasingly cold and empty, my phone rang. It was my best friend, Keerut, whom I have known since I was four, when we bonded in the playground over a shared love of Michael Jackson and Linkin Park. He invited us all over to his family’s place for a second Christmas meal, as they were eating late.That call was the faintest glimmer of hope in that bitterly cold day. I told my brother, and we set off in the car, arriving 30 minutes later to a warm house, places set for us and glasses thrust into our hands. Again, we didn’t speak much of my mum – we all knew her absence was the reason for us being there – but, instead, we got drunk and played games and were force-fed another Christmas dinner. I can’t remember what we ate or what games we played, but I remember laughing until I cried and feeling relieved that was something I could still do that it was possible to feel some happiness even in the most brutally sad times. We stayed over and when we woke up the next day, for a moment it felt as if things were OK again.I realised that in the more than 20 years Keerut and I had been friends, I had taken that friendship for granted. In Indian culture, there is a huge emphasis placed on the importance of family, the assumption that blood is a bond that will never be broken. But as any human being will tell you, friendships can also be for life. Your best friends will be there for you unreservedly and unconditionally, and that was something I didn’t realise I’d had all along.That was the last Christmas I spent with Mum but it was also the beginning of a new tradition. This year will be the seventh Christmas without her, and no doubt it will be a day full of the sadness, dread and possible happiness that anyone bereaved will experience, but it will also be another year when we have Christmas lunch with my auntie and then head to Keerut’s for the evening. It may be a difficult time of year, but that makes it all the more important to acknowledge the support – the friends – that I do have and whom I would like to thank for bringing some excitement back to my life. Theirs is a presence I will not forget, just as I will remember my mum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be44e4850e057f35bc4506a2ec295f0e28818fbc/18_41_2461_1477/master/2461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b4616ec6a365331174faef5c2201a1","title":"sunny nihilism since discovering im worthless my life has felt precious","story":"Nihilism is back in fashion, and for younger generations the idea that existence is meaningless is cause for celebrationI’m usually wary of epiphanies, lightbulb moments and sweeping realisations that reorder lives. But walking home one evening earlier this year, my existence shifted with a single passing thought.I was chronically stressed at work, overwhelmed by expectations, grasping for a sense of achievement or greater purpose and tip-toeing towards full-on exhaustion. Then it hit me: “Who cares? One day I’ll be dead and no one will remember me anyway.”I can’t explain the crashing sense of relief. It was as if my body dumped its cortisol stores allowing my lungs to fully inflate for the first time in months. Standing on the side of the road I looked at the sky and thought: “I’m just a chunk of meat hurtling through space on a rock. Pointless, futile, meaningless.” It was one of the most comforting revelations of my life. I’d discovered nihilism.Nihilism has existed in one form or another for hundreds of years, but is usually associated with Friedrich Nietzsche, the 19th century German philosopher (and pessimist of choice for high school kids with undercuts) who proposed that existence is meaningless, moral codes worthless, and God is dead.This decade it’s had a cultural comeback. Visiting the central tenets it’s easy to see why. Nietzsche’s argument that “Every belief, every considering something true, is necessarily false because there is simply no true world” feels chillingly relevant as we stumble through a “post-truth” reality. While Nietzsche (and the goths you grew up with) make it all sound like a bummer, Generation Y’s and Z’s take on things is more upbeat and absurd. Modern nihilism has been honed through memes and Twitter jokes. It manifests as teenagers eating Tide pods, fans begging celebrities to run them down with their cars, and a lot of weird TV shows. Turns out the descent into nothingness can be pretty funny.Are we witnessing a new, sunnier, generation of nihilists emerge? If meaning and purpose are overrated illusions, then so is any sense that you are special or destined for greater things. It’s a balm for a group burning out over exceptionalism, economic downturns, performative excellence, housing crises and living your best life on Instagram.In her collection of essays Trick Mirror: reflections on self-delusion, New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino grapples with the culture and conditions of a post-global financial crisis America. In particular, how cults of self-optimisation and identity have left us lost and apathetic. Several reviews used the term nihilistic when discussing the book, referring to both the content and how it made them feel.She didn’t see purposelessness as a poison seeping into our lives to turn us into the nihilistic baddies from the Big Lebowski. Rather she argued it had the potential to define and soothe a pained generation: “I think it’s the millennial condition. It’s this kind of ecstatic, fundamentally ironic but also incredibly sincere, unhinged quality.”Last year, on opposite sides of the world, two high schoolers presented TEDx talks about nihilism. Elias Skjoldborg, a junior at Hanwood Union high school in Vermont, took the stage to deliver his case for optimistic nihilism. It was aptly subtitled “Or how to be a happy emo”.During his presentation he reminded the audience of fellow adolescents that: “If you died right now it wouldn’t make a difference, big picture. If you’d never been born no one would care.”That’s the good news. “That life has no meaning is not a reason ... to be sad,” he said. If our lives are needless then the only directive we have is to figure out how to find happiness in our momentary blip of consciousness. For instance, he helpfully suggested his audience get hobbies, help others, solve problems rather than creating them, and just try their best.Subverting the stereotype of a teen nihilist, Siddharth Gupta presented his talk “Confessions of an existential nihilist” while wearing a pink button-down shirt. The senior at Kodiakanal International school in India confessed that his belief life was worthless gave him the “opportunity to find meaning in all that I do”.Unburdened by a larger mission, he was free to seek out his own: “I still believe there is no inherent meaning in life, but I now believe that because of this, there is no reason not to give everything I have and try to create my own meaning in this most likely hollow existence.”One of the many criticisms of nihilism is that it opens the door to unchecked selfishness. It’s a logical next step if you think there’s nothing to gain from life except personal happiness and pleasure. Yet for the people who have absorbed this message, the trend isn’t towards greed, but community-mindedness.Skjoldborg urged his audience to solve problems. Gupta sought to build his own meaning. Tolentino’s whole book is an argument against self-serving, neoliberal systems that crush people lower down the economic ladder than you.

In Birmingham, a screening of Blue Story, a gritty depiction of a fond boyhood friendship between two young black British men tragically sundered by gang-related postcode wars, sparked a mass brawl in the cinema foyer, unacceptably making girls queuing for a singalong to Frozen 2 run away in fear.In London in October last year, a production of Siegfried, an opera about a tooled-up psychopath, similarly provoked fisticuffs. But which one got withdrawn from view? Was it Rapman’s directorial debut about Britain in crisis with a grime soundtrack for an audience of ordinary millennials and Gen Zedsters, or the Victorian opera promoting knife crime set in a ludicrous fairyland by an antisemitic megalomaniac, and served up for a demographic of hedge fund lawyers and couturiers to the royal family? Oh, have a guess. It’s not far down the motorway from the Star City multiplex in Nechells to the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, but in social terms there is an unbridgeable chasm between the two. It’s one rule for ordinary Britons and another for opera-going stiffs. Such is the madness of broken Britain in 2019.Oh come off it, you say. Wagner’s Siegfried, the third in his 15-hour cycle Der Ring des Niebelungen, isn’t about knife crime. You can’t use that to explain why Oxford-educated Matthew Feargrieve, 43, was convicted earlier this week for punching Düsseldorf-born fashion designer Ulrich Engler, 56, during a performance. City of London magistrates heard that Feargrieve had taken exception to Engler climbing into the front row and into a seat occupied by his partner Catherine Chandler’s tweed coat. Engler told the court he placed the coat in Ms Chandler’s lap after ascertaining she had not paid for the seat, while Feargrieve said that the couturier hurled the garment to the floor. Unless it was a particularly horrible coat, that sounds out of character for Engler, whose motto on his website is “Elegance is unchanging and timeless” and who has designed dresses for the Countess of Derby.But the fact is that Siegfried does promote knife crime. It opens with a character called Mime forging a sword at an anvil in his underground lair, to make it sharp enough for the eponymous hero to slay a dragon and steal its golden hoard. Later in Act One, Siegfried actually sings a song to his sword, namely Notung! Notung! Neidliches Schwert! (What kind of freak names his sword? That’s right: a Wagnerian one.)According to Engler’s testimony, when he was assaulted the conductor had already begun and the opera was about 10 minutes into its six-hour running time. No one in court, not even the beguilingly named Judge Zani, thought to listen to their Karajan recording of Siegfried to get a sense of the mood in the posh seats that afternoon. But I have. And the music is so febrile from the get-go, with Mime beating out a metallic tattoo at about 120 beats per minute, that it astounds me that the brawl only embroiled two people. Everybody’s nerves must have been a-jangle even before Siegfried entered like a proto-football hooligan with his demented preverbal chant: “Hoiho! Hoiho! Hau ’ein! Hau ’ein!”“I had never seen someone looking with so much anger and terror at me,” Engler said of the attack. “While Mr Feargrieve was hitting me, he said: ‘How dare you talk to my wife like this?’ The only three things I said to this woman was, would you mind if I sat next to you again, have you paid for the seat, and that I was sorry.” Another case of Wagner-related madness? If so, it’s amazing the courts aren’t teeming with them.I’m not trying to exonerate Mr Feargrieve for the crime for which he was convicted on Monday and will be sentenced in January. Indeed, if the testimony of former physiotherapist Elaine McMaster, who was in the Covent Garden audience that afternoon is right – namely that Feargrieve and Chandler were swaying side to side to the music, and that Chandler was flicking her hair and being noisy – then hanging is too good for them. “People don’t behave like that in their local cinema, let alone in the Royal Opera House,” McMaster said sensibly.What I am saying is that Covent Garden should immediately commission an opera called The Coat about the night in question, to explore how classical music rather than video games causes mindless violence. Possibly with a score by Harrison Birtwistle so unlistenable you’d climb over your own granny to get out of the auditorium.That said, what’s important to note is that fights at the opera are wrong, not least because they encourage headline writers to reference old Marx brothers movies they’ve probably never seen. As Roger Scruton argues in the The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner’s Ring of the Nibelung, the takeaway from those many hours of Wagner is that, in the bleak Viking world of the Ring, despite its cast of crazily violent hammer-throwing and skull-smashing gods, is the reality of love and compassion made manifest by Brünnhilde’s sacrifice to her nutty spouse, Siegfried.Strangely, that is very similar to the message of Blue Story, though the machete-wielding toughs who injured police officers at Star City and terrified the Frozen 2 demographic clearly failed to appreciate it. Blue Story’s writer and director Andrew Onwubolu, AKA Rapman, said his film is “about love, not violence”, adding: “I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.” That message can be taken in more cheaply at screenings of Blue Story than at the opera – and, despite last month’s controversy, the film can, and indeed must, still be seen.Rapman makes an excellent point. This is, after all, the season of goodwill to all men. But not necessarily to small girls. In fact, the message I take from this tale of two cities is that it’s not Blue Story or Siegfried that should be banned, but Frozen 2. Surely that is something that most of us in broken Britain can get behind. As Boris Johnson so wisely said after last week’s general election, it is time to let the healing begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdea6c50d94b7c445a978dbc7804ad4a93216ee9/239_26_3021_1813/master/3021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eef17b898aaa39a26216fc16fc444404","title":"election 2019 what just happened","story":"Anushka Asthana is joined by  reporters and columnists to tell the story of election night.

I want us to have the smoothest possible transition for the sake of the party as a whole and for those Labour mayors and councillors who are up for re-election in May.“Despite our best efforts, I believe this election was ultimately about Brexit. The Tory campaign amplified by most of the media managed to persuade many that only Boris Johnson could ‘get Brexit done’. That will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is.“We must now listen to those lifelong Labour voters who we’ve lost. I believe that Brexit was a major, although not the only, reason for their loss of trust in us.”To applause, the parliamentary Labour party chair, John Cryer, led tributes to those who had lost their seats at the start of the meeting, including the former Stoke MPs Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth.However, critics soon lined up to attack Corbyn’s campaign, including the Newcastle North MP, Catherine McKinnell, who read out the list of seats lost in the north east and said they had not been given enough support.Others said the party must go through a transformation. The shadow transport secretary and MP for Middlesborough, Andy McDonald, said sarcastically to the press as he left the meeting that it had been “great” and a “pure joy”.The new MP for Leicester East, Claudia Webbe, who backs Corbyn and served as an Islington councillor, was laughed at in her speech when she said the party had a “lot to celebrate”. She spoke for almost ten minutes, explaining to colleagues that they should be happy about the number of BAME MPs.There has been speculation mounting since the weekend that the parliamentary Labour party might seek to bring forward Corbyn’s departure from the March date set by the general secretary, Jennie Formby.They cannot make him leave sooner but they could take an indicative vote to show him the strength of feeling among members.The meeting was also a chance for mooted leadership and deputy leadership candidates to drum up support.The potential candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is shadow business secretary, was sat at the back of the room. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who is also tipped to want to run for leader, was there as well as the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, and shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ede44b685d6cd66badd7621fa0b8939a78b962ac/0_349_5235_3141/master/5235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=817965726fcb9de87acffd4e7092f5d0","title":"tories switch to messaging app signal to curb whatsapp leaks","story":"Platform has option to make messages automatically disappear after set time periodThe Conservative party has started using the secure messaging service Signal for its internal communications with Tory MPs, following years of leaks from WhatsApp groups.Signal, which is an alternative to Facebook-owned WhatsApp, prides itself on its ultra-secure privacy features and has an option to make messages automatically disappear after a set period of time, making it harder to retrospectively leak conversations.The non-for-profit open source service, which is endorsed by the likes of Edward Snowden, promises highly encrypted ad-free communications and pledges to ensure no one can read user messages or see their calls. Earlier this year the co-founder of WhatsApp gave $50m (£38m) to Signal to help improve the service.Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns on internet freedoms, suggested the Tories’ switch to using Signal for party communications is ironic given the party’s longstanding campaign to introduce a backdoor on such messaging services for the benefit of the authorities.Killock said: “It’s great to hear that Conservative MPs are learning about the virtues of Signal and secure private communications. Let’s hope they don’t also end up voting to make these private messaging tools wholly insecure with legally mandated backdoors that end up being used by police and criminals alike.“I guess Priti Patel must be quite confused and alarmed as her party votes with its feet for secure messaging platforms, while she’s campaigning to stop them from protecting these very same users.”In October the home secretary joined her Australian and US counterparts in writing to Facebook and demanding the introduction of a “backdoor” for the police and security services in WhatsApp, which she said would allow child abusers and terrorists using the service to be caught.Facebook turned down the request on the basis that such a move would “be a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes, creating a way for them to enter our systems and leaving every person on our platforms more vulnerable to real-life harm”.A Conservative spokesperson said the real justification for their MPs to use Signal was operational, rather than for security reasons. With so many Tory MPs elected at the last election, it had become impossible to fit them all in a single WhatsApp group, because they are currently capped at 256 members.While this worked until the last election, with only a few MPs missing out, the party’s electoral success means it now has 365 MPs to coordinate – a number that Signal allows to be put in a single group.In common with much of society, the WhatsApp group has become a staple of organisation and plotting in Westminster in recent years, with screengrabs of communication regularly leaked to journalists. Some MPs have reached the point where they actively post messages in a popular WhatsApp group in the expectation that they will swiftly be passed to reporters – effectively turning them into press releases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/161d4f48bcc97b31cf23b4ad2f6a610e69612780/0_137_2475_1484/master/2475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19c92b999ac8e1189bcb23547513264d","title":"neolithic dna ancient chewing gum denmark","story":"Analysis of birch tar describes a female hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyesAt the dawn of the Neolithic era, a young woman discarded a lump of ancient chewing gum made from birch tar into a shallow, brackish lagoon that drew fishers to the coast of southern Denmark.Nearly 6,000 years later, researchers excavating the site spotted the gum amid pieces of wood and wild animal bone and from it have reassembled her complete DNA and so painted the broadest strokes of her portrait.The strands of DNA preserved in the gum point to a hunter-gatherer from continental Europe who had dark skin, dark hair and blue eyes. She lived near the lagoon, itself protected from the open sea by shifting sand barriers, about 5,600 years ago, according to carbon dating of the birch tar.Alongside her DNA, the researchers found genetic material from duck and hazelnuts – presumed remnants of a recent meal – and at least 40 types of microbes.Hannes Schroeder, a molecular anthropologist at the University of Copenhagen, said: “This is the first time anyone has got a full ancient genome from anything other than bone or teeth. The preservation of the gum is quite extraordinary. We didn’t expect to get the whole genome.”The 2cm-long lump of ancient gum was discovered during archaeological excavations at Syltholm on Lolland Island, before construction work on the Fehmarn tunnel to connect Denmark to Germany. The stone age site was more than a fishing ground, with piles of bones from cattle, deer, ox, wildcats, dogs and otters all deposited there, near the remnants of wooden fish traps, over hundreds of generations.“This was a place of special significance,” said Theis Jensen, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen, and first author on the study. “These people didn’t live at the site, but probably on dry land a couple of hundred metres away.”Birch tar, made by heating the tree’s bark, has been used as a natural adhesive for hundreds of thousands of years. In the stone age, the material was extracted on a mass scale to haft arrowheads and other tools. But it had other applications too. Lumps of the tar found at archaeological sites often contain juvenile tooth marks, and given that it contains antiseptic substances, it may have served as a prehistoric tooth brush.Jensen and Schroeder wondered whether the chewed birch tar from Syltholm might contain preserved DNA. To find out, they washed pieces of the tar and extracted what DNA they could find. Jensen said: “It turned out there was a tremendous amount of DNA in it.”The scientists found they had enough ancient DNA to reconstruct a full human genome. It showed that the person was female and had dark skin, dark hair and blue eyes. She was also more closely related to hunter-gatherers from mainland Europe than those who lived in central Scandinavia at the time, according to a report in Nature Communications. It is impossible to know her age, but given that children seemed to chew birch tar, the scientists suspect she was young.Further DNA revealed her oral microbiome, the collection of microbes that live, often harmlessly, in the mouth. Among tens of bacterial species were three linked to severe periodontal disease, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of pneumonia. The scientists also spotted the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause glandular fever. While she may well have been ill, all can be present without causing disease or illness.In May, a separate team of scientists led by Anders Götherström at Stockholm University extracted sections of human DNA from older chewed birch tar. Taken together, the studies suggest that the material could be valuable for recovering ancient human genomes from sites where no bones or teeth are ever found.Jensen said: “It’s incredible, because there are periods where we don’t have any bones, but birch pitch survives very well. It’s a substitute for bones, and it’s very intimate. You get so much information.”Götherström said the latest work was exciting. “As for human DNA, these mastics may present an alternative source for DNA from where there are limited amounts of preserved bones. But even more exciting is the ancient microbial DNA,” he said. “The mouth is an exposed area of the body. It is possible that this type of material will outcompete bones when looking for DNA from ancient pathogens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a61b53c90593160901c2d9758d87b8e65da103f/0_280_2869_1721/master/2869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fbd446df61b284160b34f24b5fd411c","title":"no home for 285000 on christmas day in england figures show","story":"Homelessness has risen sharply in cities outside London in last two years, Shelter saysAn estimated 280,000 homeless people will be rough sleeping, or living in temporary housing and hostels in England on Christmas Day – about one in every 200 of the total population, according to Shelter.The housing charity’s figure, which is likely to understate the true level of homelessness because it does not count people who are sofa-surfing or living in sheds or tents, is 3,600 higher than in 2018, and up 23,000 since 2017.London continues to be the centre of homelessness, accounting for 170,000 of the total England figure. One in every 52 people in the capital are homeless, with the borough of Newham, where one in 24 are homeless, being worst hit.Some of the other highest rates of homelessness were in Birmingham (where one in 66 residents are homeless), Manchester (one in 102), Brighton (one in 75) and Luton (one in 46), reflecting the growth of the problem outside the capital.Polly Neate, Shelter’s chief executive, said: “As well as those facing serious ill health or even death sleeping rough on our streets this winter, there are thousands of families trapped in grotty emergency B\u0026ampBs, with no space for children to sit and eat, let alone play. This is the grim truth our new government must confront and do something radical to change.”Across Britain, at least 135,000 children will be homeless and living in temporary accommodation on Christmas Day – the highest number for 12 years, Shelter estimated.Charities say rising homelessness is being driven by a lack of affordable housing and the failure of housing benefit – which has been frozen since 2016 – to keep pace with spiralling private rents. Private tenants on benefits face an average £113 a month shortfall between their local housing allowance and their rent.The Shelter figures comprised people in temporary accommodation, rough sleepers, people accepted by councils as homeless who have yet to be allocated a home, single people in hostels not counted as formally homeless, and families living in homes arranged by social services under the Children’s Act.Previous years’ estimates have included Wales and Scotland. These showed a Great Britain total of 307,000 homeless in 2017 and 320,000 in 2018. Wales and Scotland were excluded in 2019 because of changes in the way they collect homelessness data.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We’re giving £1.2bn to tackle all types of homelessness. Everyone should have somewhere safe to live, and councils have a duty to provide accommodation to those who need it, including families with children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41f608b424d42969d5f0e7ed13b35c658123047/0_0_2441_1008/master/2441.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=adc5219ad8ea4d89d1694ab4d10e7131 1370w","title":"sandown seven jockeys win flag not waved sufficiently showy manner christmas horse racing","story":"Seven jockeys banned at Sandown for allegedly ignoring a stop-race flag have won their appeals and will be able to take part in races throughout the Christmas period. “We’re all delighted,” said Harry Skelton, adding how important it was for he and his fellow riders to be vindicated in this way. “No jockey wants to put anyone at risk.”Racing’s procedures for stopping a race must surely now be reviewed and improved. The British Horseracing Authority, arguing against the appeal, insisted Sandown staff had correctly followed procedures in deploying a single yellow flag when it became clear the London National would have to be stopped on 7 December. This was because the veteran Houblon Des Obeaux collapsed on the first circuit and was being treated by vets on the track as the runners returned towards the same spot.BHA officials were confident the 10-day bans meted out to each jockey by the raceday stewards would be upheld, arguing the flagman was clearly visible to jockeys as they rode towards the third-last fence. But all seven jockeys said they did not see him and they were believed by the appeals panel, despite the ruling body’s assertion that at least some were lying.“It is clear that none of the jockeys has lied,” ruled the panel chairman, Tim Charlton QC. “We find they did not see the flag. This was 12 minutes before sunset on an extremely murky day. The flag was not being waved in a sufficiently showy manner to give the best chance of attracting the attention of the jockeys.”The ruling came at the end of a full day’s hearing, a surprise in itself to officials, who had scheduled another case for the hearing room at 1pm. It was a tetchy affair from the outset, the jockeys’ solicitor, Rory Mac Neice, scolding his BHA opposite for what he deemed a display of petulance early on and then telling a witness his evidence was “complete nonsense”.Mac Neice unpicked the case against Skelton, Daryl Jacob, Jamie Moore, Adam Wedge, Stan Sheppard, James Davies and Philip Donovan. He described attempts to stop the race as “a pretty poor plan that wasn’t very well executed. You cannot expect to stop a horse race with a solitary flag that isn’t being waved. There is a low-tech fix. You just need more flags.”Davies and Jacob were especially convincing in arguing that they could not possibly have seen the flag from their positions behind the leaders. Moore and Skelton, in the front rank, were more obviously at risk of sanction but in the end no case has been proved against them. All said they had opted to bypass the third-last because they heard a whistle and saw screens up around what they imagined to be a stricken horse on the landing side only when they got past the fence did they see that the screens were further down the track.Jockeys’ representatives insisted they still had great respect for Sandown officials and saw the BHA’s procedures as the problem, which they had complained about in 2017 after a similar incident at Perth.The BHA said it would wait to see the published reasons before offering a detailed response. It pointed out the stop-race procedures were agreed with representatives of the jockeys and racecourses in 2008."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ce8db064eabb9e22a69cc45a9b6d4e10d595f06/392_612_4171_2503/master/4171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0eb918e27ad755df7255039455fb100f","title":"best smartphone 2019 iphone oneplus samsung and huawei compared and ranked","story":"Our updated list of the top iOS and Android mobile phones – at the best prices right nowNeed a new smartphone but don’t know which one is the very best?

The selfie camera pops up from the top on command – a consistent crowd-pleaser.The 7T Pro is the fastest-feeling phone – everything zips along. It has Qualcomm’s top chip, the Snapdragon 855+, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS3.0 storage – plenty for practically everything. The optical in-display fingerprint scanner is even faster than before continuing to put the competition to shame.The latest OxygenOS 10, the firm’s super-slick version of Android 10, is arguably the best in the business too, and you’ll get prompt updates for three years.The triple camera system on the back is good too, combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. New for the 7T Pro is a super-macro mode, which is surprisingly good, producing crisp images up to just 2.5cm from the lens – great fun. The 7T Pro can’t quite beat the iPhone 11 Pro or Pixel 4XL, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.Dual-sim support is handy for work or travelling. It’s water resistant to some extent, but has no IP rating. There’s a McLaren limited edition and a 5G version in the US, but not UK where the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is still the current model.The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS 10 make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7T Pro is a stretch worth making.Buy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experienceDon’t buy if: you don’t want to stretch to such a big phoneGood things come in smaller packages. The iPhone 11 Pro isn’t the biggest or the most expensive of Apple’s 2019 smartphones, but it is the best and very nearly the best phone of the year.The iPhone 11 Pro combines a stunning, big-enough 5.8in screen, svelte, luxurious-feeling body, top-notch performance and battery life to keep up with most of the competition.Truth be told, the design is basically uncharged since the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017. The back is now frosted glass, which looks particularly good in silver, and has a triple camera lump in the top left. The rest stays pretty much unchanged.Apple’s Face ID is still the best, most widely-supported face recognition system in the business. The new A13 Bionic chip continues to lead the pack. The gesture navigation system continues to be one of the best, and you’re in line for around five years of iOS software updates from release - at least two more than any other manufacturer will provide.This year the iPhone 11 Pro introduces a significantly improved triple camera with ultra-wide, wide and telephoto lenses, which matches the best rivals in photography and beats them in video. It even has an effective night mode now.It’s not all gravy – starting with just 64GB of storage is poor. The old Lightning connector still persists, rather than the newer standard of USB-C. There’s no 5G option and it is exceedingly expensive – you don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro looking for value for money. Plus iOS 13 has been a mixed bag since its introduction, with a lot of bugs that needed fixing.But as a whole, no other phone can match the iPhone 11 Pro in power, capability and size. The iPhone 11 Pro is the smaller phone to buy and the best running iOS.You want the best smaller phone, or simply the best Apple phone, then the iPhone 11 Pro is fantastic, but comes at a considerable costBuy if: you want the best iPhoneDon’t buy if: you don’t want to spend £1,049 or want to use AndroidIf you want the Android sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that’s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that’s the Galaxy S10.The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great.Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared with rivals, and it’s light too. It’s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.The Galaxy S10 was recently updated with Samsung’s new One UI 2 software, based on the latest Android 10 including much-improved navigation gestures. You should get about three years of software support from release from Samsung, although the company is usually slower than Google and OnePlus to deliver big Android version updates.The rear triple camera is good allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won’t beat the Pixel 4 XL or iPhone 11 Pro, but gets the job done. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the better ones on the market.Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak, lasting a day of usage but not much more. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display has proved to be a bit slow and finickity over time, which can be annoying.A big screen Android experience in a relatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help too.Buy if: you want a good balance of screen and phone size without breaking the bankDon’t buy if: you want brilliant battery lifeThe best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. Even at the end of 2019, no other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei’s new Leica quad camera.The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 40MP camera is terrific and it’s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn’t enough, there’s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture. The P30 Pro might not have the best Night Sight rival, but most of the time it simply doesn’t need it.The rest of the phone is excellent, too, with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is great, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it’s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared with the OnePlus 7T Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max.The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7T Pro’s. Huawei’s Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that will last about two days. Plus the battery charges super fast and has wireless charging and power sharing.Huawei’s modified Android 10, EMUI 10, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone’s tastes. Huawei is still facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro’s recent Android 10 update showed that it should continue to receive updates as normal, however.The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellentBuy if: you want the best camera on a great phoneDon’t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of HuaweiPound for pound the OnePlus 7T offers the best performance, design and experience than any other smartphone.It’s got the big, good-looking 6.41in full HD OLED screen, with a small, widow’s-peak-like notch at the top for a selfie camera. New for the 7T is a 90Hz refresh rate, which like its bigger sibling the 7T Pro, makes even the mundane silky smooth.It’s got 2019’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of fast UFS3.0 storage. It also lasts a good 31 hours on a charge, and its OxygenOS 10 Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too.It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.The triple camera is good too, with ultra-wide, wide and 2x telephoto lenses, plus a dedicated macro mode, but it can’t beat the very best in the market. There’s no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging, but WarpCharge sees it hit full charge in 60 minutes flat.A great 90Hz screen, excellent software and the best performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than thisBuy if: you want a top-notch phone but don’t want to spend more than £549Don’t buy if: you want a really good cameraSmartphones are rated by screen size measured on the diagonal in inches. The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it\u0027s difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google\u0027s Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple\u0027s support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google\u0027s three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.Battery life varies drastically between devices, and all-day battery often doesn\u0027t mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you\u0027re out in the evening.Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn\u0027t necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.Wireless charging:\u0026nbspconvenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn\u0027t come in the boxDurability:\u0026nbspgenerally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragileResale value:\u0026nbspiPhones hold their value better than most othersOLED versus LCD: OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaperThese are good phones still worth buying if none of the top smartphones fit the bill.Apple’s cheaper iPhone 11 is the follow-up to last year’s iPhone XR and offers most of the features of the iPhone 11 Pro. It has slightly battery life too, but is missing the excellent ultra-wide angle camera, has a slightly larger, but worse screen. It is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it’s the best Apple can make.The iPhone 11 looks great in red or white, but it’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 11 certainly holds its own for the money, but the iPhone 11 Pro still the one to buy if you want the best iPhone. If you want a cheaper phone, switch to Android or buy last year’s iPhone XR.If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen or epic battery life then the iPhone 11 Pro Max is your only option. But it has really poor ergonomics, is big, expensive and heavy, making the smaller iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 are better options.The smallest, cheapest variant of Samsung’s current S10 line is still good, but falls slightly short of the high bar set by the regular Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e loses the optical zoom with only two cameras on the back, has a flat, slightly smaller screen and a lower capacity battery. It also ditches in the in-screen fingerprint scanner for one embedded in the power button – great for right-handed users but not so for the left handed.It doesn’t feel any smaller in the hand, but can be had for less if you must have a top-end Samsung for the lowest possible cost or dislike curved screens.The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use.The Galaxy Note 10+ is a Samsung super-fan’s dream. It has the biggest screen on a Samsung with a monstrous 6.8in on the diagonal, new faster UFS3.0 storage, reasonable battery life and plenty of party tricks. The stylus can now be used as a magic wand for gestures, there are three cameras on the back and is available in a 5G version too. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be a bit frustrating to use.The biggest, most powerful version of Samsung’s S-line is the S10 5G and it’s huge with a 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED screen, long oval-shaped hole-punch notch for the selfie cameras, and four cameras on the back. Performance, software and battery are good, but it’s not as slick or ergonomic as the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. The fingerprint scanner is a bit slow and can be frustrating to use.The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei’s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It recently received EMUI 10 (Android 10) and is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option.The Google Pixel 4 XL is a mixed bag. On the one hand you have a good-looking 6.3in QHD+ AMOLED display running at 90Hz, a stellar camera, new Soli radar gesture system, amazing new on-device AI and super-fast 3D Face Unlock. But on the other you have no fingerprint scanner, meaning until apps are updated to use the Face Unlock you’re forced back to using the old pin or password, the battery life is fairly short and there have been quite a few bugs that have needed fixing since launch. One day it might be great.Xiaomi’s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section.Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn’t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options.Google Pixel 4 - Great phone utterly ruined by terrible battery life - £669Razer Phone 2 - Gaming phone beast that falls down on camera performance – £500Sony Xperia XZ3 – Good, but not great phone that misses the mark – £699 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But now he’s about to go stratospheric – as a lusty, witty Dracula created by the team that revamped SherlockClaes Bang can still recall how he felt when he first delivered the deathless words: “I am Count Dracula.” The 52-year-old Danish actor gives a theatrical shudder and glances around the bright BBC meeting room. “You think, ‘Am I actually allowed to say that? Did it come out right?’ It’s like playing with something forbidden. You’re messing with the crown jewels.”Bang plays the debonair bloodsucker in the nasty, florid and viciously funny new version of Bram Stoker’s classic – a re-vamp, you might say – from Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, creators of the TV show Sherlock. In person, he is sleekly handsome, with traces of Jeremy Northam’s aristocratic froideur and Ian McShane’s velvety, carnal menace his hair and eyebrows are as black as biker leather, his face bristly today with a salt-and-pepper beard. What makes him such pleasant company, though, is his voluble, excitable quality, all sweeping hand gestures and childlike restlessness. When he inquires after my opinion of the show and receives a positive response in return, it is all he can do not to punch the air: “Fucking hell! I love it! Thank you!”He has been acting in Denmark and Germany for almost half his life but only became known internationally in 2017 when he played a put-upon museum curator in the award-winning art-world satire The Square. That film brought him to Hollywood’s attention, and landed him the role of the bleach-blond villain in The Girl in the Spider’s Web, although nothing he has done so far can compare to the level of exposure he will receive for Dracula. “Oh my lord, this is completely different!” he says, throwing his hands in the air. The show offers a lot of Bang for your buck: its three 90-minute episodes will be screened on BBC One on consecutive nights beginning on New Year’s Day before being made available internationally on Netflix. “It’s probably why I’m terrified. It feels like a big exam. The script is so strong it’s like a well-fitted glove. It’s only when you wake in the middle of the night that you go: ‘Fuuuuck. Is this really gonna fly?’”Far from blocking out the character’s long screen history, Bang embraced it by watching all the previous Draculas: “I wanted to see if there were any good ideas I could steal.” He makes special mention of Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog’s 1979 Nosferatu the Vampyre. “It was the loneliness of that character that got to me. Imagine what it’s like: it’s a Tuesday evening, 1718, mid-November, you haven’t had any company in your castle for 200 years. There’s a sadness that I really liked.” All this talk of Dracula’s interior life would count for nought if it couldn’t be felt in the fibre of Bang’s performance. He plays those poignant notes delicately in the first episode when he asks Jonathan Harker (John Heffernan) to describe the sunrise that would kill him were he to stand directly in its glow. “I had to think of him as real, not as an icon. I needed to find bits and bobs I could relate to. He might have really weird needs but they are needs all the same, just like the ones I have for sleep or food or sex.”Accompanying my sneak preview of the first two parts was a lengthy list stipulating the various twists and shocks that must not be ulged. Perhaps the biggest surprise, though, is Bang himself, even to those who saw him in The Square. That film subjected him to all manner of humiliations in one scene, he had a tug-of-war with Elisabeth Moss over a used condom that he refused to surrender to her after sex. “Nobody left that set with any kind of dignity,” he laughs. Dracula, on the other hand, finds him dripping in gravitas, sweeping through his scenes with carnivorous elegance.“He’s imposing but he also has this twinkle, and he can set pulses racing in both sexes,” says Gatiss. “It’s real charm: it feels dangerous and therefore terribly attractive, which is what you want from a sexy Dracula. We always knew we didn’t want him to be a monolithic presence. I like to say he had to be a fully rounded inhuman being. And we discovered when we were shooting that some of Claes’s most chilling bits are when he seems the most reasonable. He’s like a torturer who will very calmly say, ‘I’m going to have to take your legs off, but don’t worry, it’s honestly for the best.’”This is also, it should be said, a very witty performance. “Sometimes I was, like, ‘Are we sure we want five jokes in this scene?’” Bang says. “But the point is that Dracula has to amuse himself because no one else is going to do it. Without that pleasure, what’s the point of him getting out of bed – out of his coffin – every day? He’s insatiable, not only for blood, but for …” He grasps at the air with both hands to illustrate his point. “That kind of, ‘Grrr, I just want to get at everything! Woah! What’s this, a nunnery? Cool!’ He’s very easily engaged. And I find that quite sympathetic. I don’t think he feeds off people only to kill them.” The rapaciousness extends to gender. “Oh, he’s got broad tastes,” Bang smiles. “I like that about him. He’s not in any way prejudiced. Race, age, sexuality, anything goes.”The role represents quite a turnaround for an actor who, only a few years ago, was starting to suspect he’d been left behind by the entertainment industry. “I never heard from those people who were turning out all these amazing series that won awards across the world. I did a bit in Borgen. But they never seemed to ask for my services. I used to think there’d been a party and the whole business was there and maybe I got really drunk. I thought, ‘Perhaps I did something that no one has ever forgiven me for. Did I try to sleep with the wives of the big bosses in Danish film and television? Why am I not ever hearing anything? What’s going on?’” He shakes his head. “All those glorious years for Danish television and I spent them going, ‘Hello! I’m over here!’”Being relatively unknown can only help with a role like Dracula, which relies on an enigmatic eroticism. “We wanted to ‘do a Benedict’,” Gatiss tells me. “It’s a similar situation: Benedict Cumberbatch was known before Sherlock but he wasn’t a star. Claes is the same. He doesn’t bring any baggage but he has a sense of otherness.” Even with a few high-profile roles to his credit, there is still plenty about him that people don’t know. I was surprised, for instance, to stumble on his 2010 album Dislocated, an exercise in 1980s-influenced electronic pop that he recorded under the name This Is Not America (after the David Bowie track) to get around one Danish broadcaster’s policy of not giving airplay to songs by actors. There’s even a promo video showing Bang performing in a wig and makeup. “My wife and I filmed that one Saturday afternoon,” he says, coming over a touch bashful. The music itself is very Pet Shop Boys, Bang’s vocals a bit Psychedelic Furs. “I sit down and go, ‘Right, this one won’t sound like the 1980s’ and then 10 minutes later I’m back in the 80s again.”Bang was already on his way to becoming a sex symbol after The Square, and Dracula, which contains countless smouldering closeups as well as a nude scene in which he is clad in nothing but a thin film of goo, will do little to stem such attention. I raise the subject light-heartedly, but for the first time in our conversation he looks faintly downcast. “It’s not something you can really work with,” he says quietly. “I try not to think about it because then you become an idea of yourself. It’s important to stay fluid. Otherwise it might box you in.” Then he perks up, and his formerly enthusiastic self returns as suddenly as it had vanished. “On the other hand, that’s fine! It is. It’s all right!” Phew. For a moment there, it looked as if Bang was going out with a whimper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3266c7f421a7194963aa1cf6c7ee4e04a4383bc2/0_103_5840_3504/master/5840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=760fc9603ed9db51d316923c5ee460a7","title":"steve bannon working class republicans labour","story":"The former White House strategist and far-right agitator hails the British election as a ‘victory for populism’ with lessons for the USSteve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist associated with global far-right nationalist movements, has urged Republicans to “find our AOCs” – a reference to the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – to claim the mantle of the party of the working class.In an interview with the  at his Capitol Hill townhouse, Bannon, who helped shape the party in Donald Trump’s image, argued that Republicans have to fight back against the “perfect casting” of Democrats elected to Congress last year by boosting equivalents from their own ranks.The combative 66-year-old is the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, which he once described as “the platform of the ‘alt-right’”, a movement that has embraced racism and antisemitism, and an ex-chairman of Donald Trump’s isive 2016 election campaign.His transition to a senior role at the White House was hailed as “excellent” by the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and “amazing” by Peter Brimelow of the white nationalist site VDAR. Bannon left the administration in 2017 after playing a key role in the US president’s equivocation over a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was widely condemned, but remains influential.“We’ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party,” said Bannon, relaxing at a table with an autographed photo of Trump behind him. “Now, interestingly, we don’t have any elected representatives who believe that, but that’s a legacy issue. We’ll get over that. We’ve got to find our AOCs.”Ocasio-Cortez, a 30-year-old former bartender from New York, was elected to Congress last year and has built a huge social media following as a member of “the Squad”, a group of four progressive women of colour. Her eagerly sought presidential endorsement went to fellow progressive senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.The Democrats and their supporters have “better casting”, Bannon admitted. “They did an amazing job in 18. I keep saying I admire AOC. I think her ideology’s all fucked up, but I want her. I want to recruit bartenders. I don’t want to recruit any more lawyers. I want bartenders.”Congressional Republicans are dominated by ageing white men from comfortable backgrounds. Among Democrats, Bannon also pointed to military veterans such as Max Rose of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, both elected as the party swept the House of Representatives in 2018. “That’s perfect casting. That’s why we got smoked.”Democrats were boosted in the midterms by Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who spent $110m through his own political action committee. An impressive 21 of the 24 candidates he supported won their races. Bloomberg is now also running for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 US election.“People are missing the point about Bloomberg,” said Bannon, who co-hosts a radio programme about Trump’s impeachment called War Room. “Trump wouldn’t be impeached if it were not for Bloomberg. It’s Bloomberg’s hundred million dollars that won the seats … The Democrat party is just like Republicans: a pass through. There’s no actual people to do anything. They’re not out in any state ringing doorbells. Those activist groups are. That’s where Bloomberg put his hundred million dollars.”In a second interview by phone last week, Bannon drew parallels with the British general election, in which Conservative Boris Johnson trounced Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, accused of failing to stamp out antisemitism in the party. Johnson took a wrecking ball to a “red wall” in traditional working-class areas, just as Trump broke through the “blue wall” in midwestern states in the 2016 election.“I think it’s a victory for populism,” Bannon said, “Obviously radical economic ideas and socialism and more government involvement, coupled with virulent antisemitism, is not a winning ticket. I believe the Democratic party here, particularly on the far left – the Squad, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – should embrace the lessons because I don’t believe it was just Corbyn’s personality.”He added: “Obviously Corbyn had issues, a personality that seemed to rub people the wrong way, particularly some of his core voters, but this is much deeper than that and you just can’t just turn it off to ‘one guy was more popular than the other’. This was, I think, a very serious vote and people paid a lot of attention to this and wanted to get Brexit done.”Bannon said he was fascinated by focus groups he saw on British TV during the election campaign. “These were Labour voters and they were not going to vote for Labour and the reason was they kept asking, ‘How are these programmes going to be paid for?’ What I was most impressed with was the specificity and the granularity of the questions.“People don’t want to be spun any more. They don’t want to be BS’d any more. They want to know what you’re laying out and how you’re going to effectuate it and, most importantly, how you’re going to pay for it and ‘if paying for it means more increased taxes or less opportunities for me, you’re not going to get my vote no matter how good it sounds’.”He added: “I think the Democrats, on whether it’s Green New Deal or healthcare for illegal aliens or whatever, ought to take the lessons of the working class. These are lifetime Labour members that voted for a Tory.”Bannon regards Johnson as neither a nationalist nor a populist and likens the prime minister’s vision of Brexit to “Singapore-on-the-Thames” – very different from the version hoped for by those who voted for him. Even so, Bannon argues that both the Conservatives and Republicans should aim to seize their traditional rivals’ territory by appealing to the working class.Critics say Bannon is an ardent nationalist, nihilist and attention seeker hellbent on disrupting and destroying the political establishment. He suggests his desire to transform the Republican party as a working-class force stems from a worldview that pitches the elites against the so-called “deplorables”, a term based on a comment by Hillary Clinton that was widely seen as an insult to long-disparaged and forgotten people.“My whole theory on the right is that we if we want capitalism to survive, we need to make people capitalist. The problem is they’re not capitalists. We have oligarchs and serfs. That system is not going to survive. I tell the donors, you may hate me, but all your Paul Ryan bullshit at the Heritage Foundation can’t win national elections. He can’t win Wisconsin, OK? Donald Trump can.”The White House adviser Stephen Miller, a white nationalist, told Bannon in a 2016 radio interview that America could be “decimated” by immigration and lose its sovereignty. Bannon, who has worked with openly racist far-right leaders across Europe, denies that racial resentment is central to the resurgent populism – even though the FBI reported last month that personal attacks motivated by bias or prejudice have reached a 16-year high, with a sharp increase in violence against Latino people.The Trump administration has notoriously attacked workers’ rights, cutting the number of workplace safety inspectors, tightening qualifications for who must be paid the minimum wage or overtime and pushing trade unions to the margins.Bannon appears untroubled by having helped put a man endorsed by white nationalists in the Oval Office. “Look, this is what drives me nuts about the left. All immigration is to flood the zone with cheap labour, and the reason is because the elites don’t give a fuck about African Americans and the Hiic working class. They don’t care about the white working class either. You’re just a commodity.“So they have unlimited labour and they’re paying you nine bucks an hour. ‘Let more guys in and, by the way, it’s bigger markets.’ It destroys the working class. That’s what we’ve got to protect. Once we show working-class people of every ethnicity and race that you being a citizen you get a special deal, you get that realignment.”A former naval officer and Goldman Sachs investment banker, Bannon’s emphasis on citizenship would be unlikely to satisfy current US citizens who endure immense class, gender and race inequalities. The gap between the haves and have-nots grew last year to its highest level in more than half a century of tracking income inequality, according to US Census Bureau figures released in September. The independent not-for-profit CDC Foundation says black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware. Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful. They’re a young, independent company and they sell lots of other handmade things such as risograph prints by local artists.”407 Great Western Road, G4 9JAShow your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f2c9a26f832b9957df0f178b0e25d1a45f8cdd/418_2114_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09930e09e9b7d6674f8445610cfea1b4","title":"the more festive the better how the high street becomes a special place at christmas","story":"Shopping takes on a new life at Christmas as the high street is transformed – as shoppers profess to having a little more goodwill than on your average Saturday and independent stores become the top destinationsAt the risk of sounding incredibly basic, I’ll confess: after the Christmas music, the decor is my favourite part of the festive season. While I’m next to useless when it comes to putting up my own decorations, I’m drawn like a moth to the flame to any household, restaurant, market or shop that has put in the extra effort. The more fake snow, twinkling lights and jingling bells, the better.In the car-centric Toronto suburb where I grew up, most of my youthful Christmas shopping was confined to the local mega-malls, which were unfailingly packed with overheated shoppers from Black Friday through to Boxing Day, so moving to the UK has been something of a revelation. No mall Santa, however rosy-cheeked, can really compete with the quaint holiday market in my boyfriend’s Lancashire hometown, or Kew Gardens’ festive trail of lights.That’s why you’re likely to find me gawping at the garlands over Regent Street when they’re illuminated later this month. The first major high street in London to adopt the practice of street-long decoration, Regent Street has been doing its Christmas light display since 1954, after a reporter described London as “drab” during the holiday season. Oxford Street followed suit soon after, in 1959, and by the end of the 1960s, high streets across Britain were invested in the new tradition. In fact, many cities now make an event of the day the lights are switched on, complete with fair rides, pantos and celebrities of varying degrees of fame.These spectacles aren’t just about dazzling onlookers. In Christmas and the British: A Modern History, historian Martin Johnes explains that light displays “gave 20th-century Christmas shopping a sense of occasion that differentiated it from the wider shopping experience that had become so embedded in everyday life”. More than just setting a mood, high street Christmas decorations make shopping less of a chore. If we have to endure the hordes each season, why not do it somewhere we don’t only tolerate, but enjoy?It’s not only the busy high streets following this logic. The coloured lights strung by volunteers in the tiny Cornish fishing village of Mousehole, all funded by donations, attract some 30,000 tourists a year to the benefit of local businesses. And for the last three years, Broadway Road in the Cotswolds has hosted late-night shopping evenings in December, with local stores staying open until 8:30pm so shoppers can stock up on gifts and take in a mix of performances in a cheerful environment. A friend of mine who worked at a Broadway Road hair salon recalls the time her team dolled up Three Wise Women and had them ride down the street on camels.Partial to a late-night browse myself, I usually venture to Mount Street in Mayfair to watch the lights get switched on, and spend the rest of the night wandering through the boutiques, sipping complimentary champagne and stuffing my face with mince pies to a medley of choristers and fashionable DJs. You can get the same buzz on many high streets in December, when independent shops stay open late and a holly wreath (or cup of mulled wine) is always close by.For all my talk about the high street at Christmas, I’m not one of those people who sorts out their list early. I pick up inspiration over the course of the year, and then do most of my shopping in the two weeks before the big day. That period, when the excitement around Christmas is reaching its peak, is when I feel most energised and most excited to take part in any Christmas-related activity, whether it’s ice-skating, eating Serrano ham at a friend’s flat or having one final night out before everyone goes home for the holidays. And in those instances, as with the shops, the more festive the environment, the better.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

But they can’t make up s*** about me – and if they do, I have to take it to the courts.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesMs Flint said that Putney and Canterbury – two Labour seats in the south – were not a fair exchange for the dozens of northern seats that had been lost to Boris Johnson.The party had “gone too much towards the metropolitan cities and university towns and away from these core areas and it breaks my heart”, she warned.And she said: “I don’t believe anybody who has been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is credible to be leader.

After returning to her home having witnessed the destruction of her husband (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who was revealed to be the blue god Dr Manhattan in episode seven, Angela Abar\u0026nbsp(Regina King) begins to clean up a broken pack of eggs on her kitchen floor.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRemembering a line Dr Manhattan said to her in the previous episode – “Watch the eggs” – she opens the box to find one intact and remembers\u0026nbspthe very first conversation they had, 10 years previous.In that chat, Dr Manhattan matter-of-factly told an unconvinced Angela that he could transfer his powers to another via, for example, an egg. He says that if somebody swallowed that egg whole, they would theoretically be able to “walk on water”.Created with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

(FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Angela, grieving the loss of her love, heads to her back garden swimming pool, swallows the egg and, as she lowers her foot to the water, the show ends.When asked whether he intended the final moment to be an open-ended mystery about whether or not Angela had acquired Dr Manhattan\u0027s powers, Lindelof told The Hollywood Reporter: “There are certainly two possible outcomes. But if you watch the entire season again, or if you look at the poster for Watchmen that existed 15 weeks ago, our intention is clear. That’s what I’ll say.”Following these comments, many fans began posting the artwork for Watchmen, which shows King’s character Angela covered in a blue light.\u0026nbspIt seems the clues were there the entire time.Speaking about a potential second season, Lindelof told Vanity Fair: “These nine episodes were planned to stand alone and that doesn’t exclude the possibility that there will be more\u0026nbspWatchmen.”“Whether or not I’ll be involved will be driven almost entirely by whether or not I come up with an idea that I feel is worthy of telling another story.”Watchmen is available to watch on NOW TV.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania.

She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way. Now we are told that the scariest stepmother since Cinderella’s has decided to buy her long-suffering family, including her -year-old mum, Botox vouchers for Christmas.Obviously there’s a money-making opportunity here, as Kris has signed up to promote a Botox company offering  gt tokens as seasonal presents.And I suppose eventhey are insulted or unhappy about her gt, they won’t be able to show those emotions on their newly frozen faces.So Kris wins again.I’M deeply concerned and extremely angry about the current mumps epidemic among hundreds of university students.Since this summer, more than , cases of this dangerous and infectious disease have been reported. If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So instead he’s issued an inadequate non-apology, claiming responsibility for his “share” of the defeat.His share ! His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote. To make him vote blue again, the Tories need to deliver. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The speech will be widely seen as an opening bid in the race to replace Mr Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party. Hoyle, , who was first elected in November just before parliament was dissolved for the five-week general election campaign, was re-elected uncontested. He had been deputy speaker since .A speaker has to be trusted, Hoyle said, before two lawmakers carried out the parliamentary tradition of dragging him to the Speakeraposs chair.

Roger Tyers instead took a month to journey the , miles from Southampton to the Far East. The -year-oldaposs epic odyssey included  trains across nine countries and cost him more than £, - almost triple the cost of aflight. Mr Tyers was travelling to the Chinese port city Ningbo for academic research in May.And the climate-conscious scientist told CNN that he felt compelled to stop flying when UN climate experts warned last year the world had less than  years to avoid catastrophic levels of global warming.Tyers says his train journey to China produced almost % less emissions than aflight. Itaposs hard to understand how polluting air travel is and the amount of energy and kerosene it takes to put people in the air and get them across the planet, he said. Thousands of people worldwide have publicly pledged to stop flying, including teenage activist Greta Thunberg, who has inspired youth climate protests around the world. Activist Maja Rosen launched the Flight Free campaign in Sweden in  with the aim of encouraging , people not to fly for one year Although only around , people signed the online #flightfree pledge, Rosen told CNN that the campaign had made more people aware of the urgency of the climate crisis and motivated them to travel by train more often.  The campaign sparked a wave of social media posts showing people traveling by train, accompanied by the hashtags #flygskam and #tågskryt, which mean flight shame and train brag in Swedish. Ms Rosen told CNN: One of the problems is that people feel thereaposs no point in what you do as an inidual. The campaign is about making people aware thatwe do this together, we can actually make a huge dference.  A passengeraposs footprint from an inidual flight depends on a number of factors, including how far they fly and how full the plane is, but also on what class they travel in: First class passengers are given more space than economy passengers, meaning theyaposre responsible for a bigger proportion of the planeaposs emissions. Emissions from train travel also depend on many factors, including how the train is powered. An electric train powered by clean energy will have much lower emissions than a diesel-powered train, for example. Greta Thunberg was today named one of this yearaposs ten people who mattered in science by prestigious journal Nature.

The colourful transformation of little Michaelaposs bedroom was truly a labour of love for factory worker Adam Hood, who dreamed of being a carpenter as a teenager, but had no prior building experience. Using trial and error, Adam, a lelong Lego fan, built Michael a bunk bed which appears to be entirely made of the giant colourful bricks in the familyaposs three-bed terrace in Bromsgrove, Worcs. At the same time, the married dad-of-two was painstakingly amassing a huge new Lego collection after scouring car boots and charity shops - and supplementing it with the same pieces he had as a youngster. Former cobbler Adam, , said: I have always been a massive fan of Lego from when I was a kid. The thing I love so much about it is you can do anything you like - the only limit is your imagination. I have also always been keen on DIY, but before this Iaposd never taken on such a massive project. I wanted to be a carpenter when I was younger, but when I left school there were no apprenticeships so I became a cobbler instead. This was a chance to scratch that itch. When I put all the new Lego I collected in Michaelaposs room, I discovered I still had a box of my own Lego from when I was a kid so I added that too. Together, our collection has grown tremendously over the last few years - we must have , bricks now. When Michael saw the room for the first time, he was totally gobsmacked - more than anything because Iaposd been collecting Lego for six months that he knew nothing about. People that have seen it say aposyouaposre such a good dadapos but more than anything, I wanted to show the kidsthey try hard enough they can do anything they want to - nothing is impossible.  Adam started the project in May, when he changed jobs from his previous role as a cobbler and had weeks off at a time in between long factory shts. He created the Lego-shaped bunkbed frame from a single huge sheet of MDF before meticulously gluing on  wooden dots to give the bricks their familiar appearance. Adam then covered the whole structure in layers of perfectly-applied brightly coloured paint to give the illusion the bed is formed out of giant Lego bricks. He scoured car boot sales and charity shops for new Lego packs - buying tens of thousands of bricks - and estimates he spent £, on the transformation in total.  After keeping Michael out of the room for the last eight weeks before the big reveal earlier this month, Adam captured his sonaposs adorable reaction on video - as well as the hilariously jealous strop thrown by daughter Roseanne, eight, who is now demanding her own aposanimal discoapos-themed space. And while we Samantha, , a nurse, was exasperated at theof time the project took, Adam said she was proud of him for seeing it to completion. He estimateshe had been working on the project for eight hours every day, it would still have taken him three months to finish. Adam said: When we moved in  years ago we decorated to make it ours, but weaposd had kids since and it was time to make it a space for them too. Roseanne is extremely jealous and has already asked for her room to be decorated in an aposanimal discoapos theme. My dad Peter helped me with the build, but other than that it was just a case of trial and error.

Mariaaposs victim impact statement has been read to Newcastle Crown Court as Ewan Ireland was sentenced to  years for the senseless murder of the popular solicitor at Eldon Square shopping centre in August. Mr Duncan, , was heading for the bus home from work when he bumped into the angry teenager, who was armed with a stolen screwdriver, Chronicle Live reports.  Ireland plunged a screwdriver into Mr Duncanaposs chest, piercing his heart and fatally wounding him. Maria, who was joined by around  family members for the hearing, listened as her words were read to the court by the crown. Richard Wright QC said: “On August  my le was ruined and my sons’ lives were ruined by a senseless and unprovoked act of a stranger. She had gone to the bus stop to pick him up but he didn’t get off. “I called him and texted him but got no reply,” she said. Soon afterwards she got a phone call from the police asking her to go to the RVI because her husband had been assaulted.  “I thought he had been injured but when I got to the RVI the doctor said there was nothing they could do to save him. ”He had been stabbed straight through the heart and nothing could be done to save him. ”Those words haunt me every single day. I had to see him to believe what I was told was true. “I felt I had been stabbed through the heart too.”  She added: “The pain never goes away. I don’t sleep properly, I get flashbacks when I close my eyes. ”I have panic attacks in public places, especially busy shops and supermarkets. “I avoid the town centre because I feel sick and start shakingI go near where it happened.” “The boys want to try to get their lives back to normal but I know it will never be normal again. They have gone back to school but are struggling. “We are all scarred by this and will be for the rest of our lives.” “Peter was always here supporting and guiding his boys through le and this has been snatched away from us. ”Our lives will never be the same now and we miss him every day.”  She added: The future now is painful. Birthdays, Christmas and holidays without Peter are just unbearable. “Peter was the perfect husband and my best friend. ”He was such a loving and caring man. ”Everyone keeps telling me Peter was always smiling and they are right. He was always smiling, he was happy, we were happy. “That’s ended, my le has ended.” A statement was also read from Peter’s eldest son, who we have agreed not to name at the request of the family. He was in the city centre, with friends at the cinema, when his dad died.  It read: As I got off the bus at the Haymarket I noticed a lot of police in the area. “I assumed something must have happened but had no idea it had anything to do with my dad.” ”When I got home my mum and brother were waiting for me and they were very upset. ”They said there had been an incident in town and dad was not coming home.” He added: It’s been very upsetting, it was so dficult seeing my dad in the viewing room at hospital and going to his funeral. ”I’m concerned for my grandparents because they are in their s.  ”This has been dficult for me, I’ve had dficulty eating and sleeping and find it hard to concentrate on my studies. ”I’ve thought about how I will miss him during key stages in our lives such as marriage andwe have children. ”I’m concerned about my mum being alone without him.” Speaking about his dadaposs killer he added: “I’ve read articles in the press about Ewan Ireland and how he had been released under investigation in relation to another incident. “I’m angry he was out and free and can’t understand why he was not locked up.

The couple, both  and from Duffield, Derbyshire, are still on the ship and also allege they have been ignored by staff because of their sexuality during their £, honeymoon. NHS worker Dan has branded Tui a disgrace and said the pair, who tied the knot a year ago, want to come home because their getaway has been ruined. He wrote on social media from the ship: Heartbroken at this cruise. We have received so much homophobic abuse from Tui staff on board the Marella Discovery. We want to come home. TUI are a disgrace! Dan said today: Initially, it was that they refused to provide a double bed rather than the two singles we were given, even though the booking did state it was our honeymoon.  When we requested this to be completed at reception five times they simply pointed and laughed at us. I had to push them together myself for it to be done. He claims when they complained they were told by a member of staff: I find it hard to believe as Iaposm the minority on this ship as a heterosexual woman, not you. Dan and Chance, an interpreter for the deaf, claim bar staff were laughing and pointing at them as they danced.  Dan said: We are being treated dferently from the bar staff and in some cases not being served at all and feeling like we are invisible. We have danced with each other and noticed bar staff laughing and also pointing at us. Passengers have witnessed this happening and have all been really supportive. Dan also alleges that staff have refused to take pictures of them together despite being only too happy to photograph heterosexual couples.  We had to have a private photo shoot in their studio away from other guests which was brilliant but those pictures had to be paid for, he said. The two have also slammed the entertainment on stage, which they claim has been racist and transphobic. Dan said: A member of staff has just been sat behind us slagging us off after we raised concerns about racist and transphobic jokes which were not appropriate. Tui, having seen the coupleaposs posts on social media, have tried to make amends by giving them champagne, strawberries and a free meal in the a la carte restaurant, said Dan.

Jesse Gardner didnapost padlock her food while staying in Ronald McDonald House near Evelina Childrenaposs Hospital in London because she thought aposno one could be so lowapos. Daughter Luna Webster was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, leaving the six-week-old with just one half of her heart and forcing her to go under the kne twice within just three days of her birth. But Jesse, , was livid to discover their food repeatedly swiped during her stay to remain nearby seriously ill Luna. Jess claim she was aposheartbrokenapos when the cruel thief knocked bottles of her frozen breast milk onto the floor during the raid, where they defrosted and more than ml had to be binned last week. Taking matters into her own hands, the enraged mum-of-one left three angry notes telling the food thief to aposf*** offapos and aposhope you enjoyed MY sausagesapos. Jesse claims she first noticed her food being swiped when her milk from the communal fridge had been used, but decided to let it slide as aposeveryone has been caught short beforeapos. But the mum was horried when she realised someone had been helping themselves to a ready meal from her freezer on Sunday [December ] and sausages the following day. On both occasions, Jesseaposs breastmilk had been scattered across the freezer-cupboard with bottles carelessly tossed aside and strewn across the floor to defrost. Jesse, from Ashford in Kent, said: It was absolutely heartbreaking for me to throw away more than mls of my milk. More than anything I feel really disappointed that this would happen in a place like Ronald McDonald. I had noticed milk go missing from our fridge but weaposve all been caught short when you need a coffee in the morning so I decided to let it slide. On Sunday evening I came back to the house and went straight to the freezer to put some more bottles of expressed breast milk in. But I noticed that there were a couple of my bottles on the floor and they had defrosted. I opened my compartment to find what had been neatly stacked bottles were all over the place and one of my ready meals was missing.  I stacked the bottles back up neatly but sadly I had to throw the bottles of milk that had been left on the floor away. This is what upset me the most. Any mother who has expressed or even breastfed their baby knows how valuable this milk is, especially to a premature baby. The next night I ed again to the same disheartening sight. Again my milk was knocked over and this time a whole bag of sausages had also disappeared. Jesse claims she and her partner Adam Webster, , had been shown the communal kitchen when they arrived and allocated lockers in the fridge and freezer - but the couple had to provide their own padlocks. The mum claims she had decided against ordering padlocks after noticing that most of the other compartments hadnapost been locked shut and thinking that no one would be aposlow enoughapos to steal their food.  Jesse, who works as a debt management consultant, said: When we first arrived the staff showed us the communal kitchen and the allocated lockers in the fridge and freezer. They said that we can lock themwe wanted but would have to provide the locks ourselves. Looking at the other compartments I only saw one that had been locked and made the decision not to buy locks. I thought, every family staying there was in the same boat as us, nobody would be low enough to steal from other families in their situation. I decided to write the notes because I was really frustrated - this was the second time it had happened. I donapost knowthere has been a reaction to my notes or not, but I have reported these incidents to the staff and they said they were very sorry to hear that this was happening. But unfortunately because there is no CCTV in the kitchen area so it would be impossible to find out who it is doing this. I have now ordered some padlocks so I can be sure this will not happen again. Luna, who was born weighing just lb oz and had since lost weight due to infections after birth, relies on her mumaposs expressed breast milk to stay strong during her treatment.  The newborn is not eligible to have open heart surgery until she is at least lbs, putting the pressure on Jesse to help her gain weight to continue her treatment. Jesse said: Luna was born with a very serious heart defect which basically means she is missing the left side of her heart. She was born prematurely five weeks early too, due to me having severe pre-eclampsia. Luna weighed just lb oz when she was born and she had complications with infections in the following weeks meant she was finding it very dficult to gain weight. My breast milk is so important to give her the nutrition she needs. Gaining weight is vital to her development, and not only for the obvious reasons but because she needs to be at least lbs to be eligible for her first big open heart surgery. Normally this surgery would be done within four days of birth.  At the moment, Luna is being kept alive with medication to support her heart and smaller procedures until she is big enough. She has only just got back up to her birth weight after losing loads of weight from being so poorly. Luckily I have a good supply and lots in the freezer in the hospital as well. Weaposre expecting that she will be in hospital until she is around six to seven months at least.

The current Bishop of Chelmsford, Stephen Cottrell, will take up the post, Downing Street announced today. The job is the second most important in the Church of England. Bishop Stephen, who is married with three children, will take up the role when John Sentamu stands down in June next year. He said he was “humbled and excited” at becoming the th Archbishop of York. In , Bishop Stephen said: “Even today I meet people who think you have to be highly educated or suited and booted to be a person who goes to church. That’s so frustrating. “How did it come to this, that we have become known as just the Marks and Spencer option when in our heart of hearts we know that Jesus would just as likely be in the queue at Asda or Aldi ” Bishop Stephen, , admitted the church’s record on ethnic ersity “isn’t good” as he prepared to replace Archbishop John, the church’s most senior black bishop. Speaking to journalists in London, Bishop Stephen renewed his calls for greater equality for black and minority ethnic clergy in senior positions - and said bishops “must take responsibility” for a lack of ersity. He also pledged the church should welcome “absolutely everyone, regardless of their sexuality,” adding: “There is absolutely no place for homophobia in the Church.”  Bishop Stephen said it was important “survivors’ voices are heard” in the wake of claims being examined by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. He added: “When I look at the challenges that lie ahead, I think this is probably the most important. “We need to put our house in order, we need to ensure that the church is a safe place for everyone.

The heartbreaking story has been shared over Twitter by London Reconnections editor John Bull, My London reports .It all started just before Christmas seven years ago, when a very upset woman approached the staff at Embankment. She kept desperately asking why the voice had gone. It took them a while to realise what she meant by aposthe voiceapos - she meant the man who said aposMind the Gapapos in a booming, over-enunciating voice. The staff explained that the system had been updated and new voices had been used, to which the woman said: That voice was my husband. The woman, a GP called Dr Margaret McCollum, told the staff how her husband was an actor, Oswald Laurence, and while heaposd never been a huge success he had been the man who recorded all the announcements for the Northern Line in the s. Oswald had died in , leaving his widow heartbroken, but there was one thing that helped ease her pain - she could hear his voice every day on the way to work, and would sometimes sit on the  to listen for a bit longer. The staff felt awful for the woman, but they didnapost know what to do as the whole system had been redone. They promised to look into it and seethe old recordings still existed.  In the new year Margaret was on her way to work when over the speakers she heard a familiar voice - it was her husband. It turned out there were a lot of people at the station and across Transport for London who had lost loved ones and would give anything to hear their voice again, and they knew they had the power to give that to someone.

Elizabeth Watkins, , struggled to walk or stand when she weighed st lb at her heaviest and cut herself off from the outside world to avoid strangersapos stares and pity. The internal recruitment consultant, from Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, has since lost an incredible st.She had struggled with her weight since she was a child, growing up in a mixed Turkish and Armenian family which meant that many traditions and celebrations were marked with food.Elizabeth realised she couldnapost carry on as she was and knew she had to change her habits to lose weight to become healthier, so in May  she decided to have a gastric bypass. After surgery, with determination she ate just  calories every single day for an entire year to bring down her weight. This helped her to lose an impressive one stone a month and after a year she continued at just , calories to lose the rest of the weight. Within just  months she lost an incredible st and Elizabeth now weighs a much healthier st lb and wears a slim UK size . She also found the love of her le and the two love birds have just got engaged.  Elizabeth said: Iaposve been large all my le including throughout my childhood. A lot of factors for this were due to eating food for comfort during both bad times and in celebration at good times. Also, food was very important culturally. When my parents orced, I was indulged in even more foods. I used to hide away from others, and I built myself a safe world where I interacted only with people who knew me. I abstained from anything that would put me in new surroundings. As I grew, I found it hard to work, stand or sit unsupported for anything more than an hour.  I found it hard to get out of bed or off sofas without an effort on my part. As I grew, I just stayed in denial telling myself that I didnapost want to do any of those things anyway. I never really had a meaningful relationship. I didnapost have enough confidence in myself to find someone and I believed no one would find me attractive. Although I was lucky to not hear negative remarks from people, I did receive stares and it felt awful when strangers gave me looks of pity. She added: I was skipping breakfast and then eating two sandwiches, a big bag of crisps and chocolate bar for lunch. In the afternoon I ate cake and biscuits with a cup of tea with three sugars.  Then for dinner I had two large adult portions of home cooked food, ready meals or takeaway. I would fill in lots of gaps with more sweets, chocolates or ice cream. I knew I couldnapost keep going on as I had before. Iaposd seen a friend who successfully lost weight following a gastric bypass. I weighed st lb and I decided to have the same operation myself on th May . I didnapost rely on the surgery to be a magic cure. I overhauled my entire relationship with food. In my first year I religiously stuck to only  calories a day with g of protein. I managed to lose one stone every month with this approach. I relaxed a bit to , calories a day to lose the last three stone.  By January this year, she brought her weight to st lb. Elizabeth said: Iaposm a UK dress size   and Iaposm happy to also say that Iaposve since fallen in love and we just got engaged. Now I stick to eating at the same times each day. At .am Iaposll have coffee without sugar, Activia yoghurt, a plum, a clementine and handful of grapes. At  I have a bowl of MS Golden Syrup Porridge with semi-skimmed milk, a handful of blueberries and a cup of tea with sweetener.  At .pm Iaposll have a mixed salad with lemon dressing, a pack of quavers, a pear and a diet Coke. At . I have a cup of tea with sweetener with one light digestive biscuit. At . I have an apple. Then at pm I have a normal dinner with very little oil and a smaller bowl. At . I have a small bag of Haribo or one Lindt chocolate ball. She added: This might not seem the healthiest diet to have but denying myself of the things I craved meant I only lasted a week then binged. My way, I donapost deny myself anything but everything is in moderation.  Elizabeth said that since she lost the weight she is totally unrecognisable and she has also managed to reconnect with two lost friends. She adds that losing weight has completely transformed her le to being healthier and more mobile, to finally having the confidence to make new friends that will last a le time. She said: People just donapost recognise me anymore. Even my own mother doesnapost, she walked right past me. Also, itaposs been really great to reconnect with two old lost friends. It took me a long time to realise that the breakdown in our friendship was due to me.

The couple said they were left aposvery upsetapos and repulsed after tucking into their food from China Star, in Leyland, Lancashire, on Friday, which ended up in the bin. After experiencing communication issues with the takeaway, Phil reported the incident to the third party delivery service. But he was informed that because the order had not been marked as aposcompleteapos by the restaurant, no refund could be given. Phil, , said they only made his discovery after eating some of the food. They had opted for mock chicken in sweet and sour sauce, homemade veg spring rolls, tofu chow mein, seaweed and boiled rice. Phil said: It was the first time we had ordered from there. They had - or appeared to have - a good vegetarian range and we spotted some stuff we fancied on the menu. My we ordered it and it came as expected, on time. We dished it up and started eating it. We both looked at each other and said it didnapost taste right, it was clearly meat. We were really upset and we contacted the restaurant and expected an apology but we couldnapost understand the person we spoke to and we binned it. Phil and Elizabeth, who have two daughters, aged four and one, said the experience was quite repulsive. They have been vegetarians since the start of the year, and full vegans for three months. They made this decision due to dietary reasons, as Phil is intolerant of dairy, and after watching animal cruelty documentaries. Phil, a technical relationship manager at Ivanti, said: We have been moving towards being vegan since the start of the year. But we have been full vegan for three months. This is partially due to dietary reasons as Iaposm intolerant of diary. And after watching some documentaries about animal cruelty, we decided it wasnapost for us. We feel quite upset. Given we made the decision not to eat meat, it was quite repulsive. [When] eating meat, these images come into your mind. I didnapost think Iaposd ever look at meat and my stomach would be turned. A Just Eat spokesperson said: We want all of our customers to have a positive experience when ordering their food online and were sorry to hear that in this case, this customeraposs experience did not reflect the standard we would hope to deliver. We have spoken to the customer directly to issue a full refund and are looking into this with the restaurant partner involved. However, Phil insists that he is not bothered about the refund but fears the error has left him worried the takeaway is not being as responsible as he would expect. He added: Iaposm not really fussed about the refund, itaposs more to do with the handling and [the fact] it was two dishes in one order. One is a mistake, two is just concerning. My concern is that the person we spoke to may not understanda customer has allergies and wouldnapost communicate it to the chef. I just felt like theyaposre not being as responsible as Iaposd like. It might have just been a one off. In response to the incident, owner of China Star, Rui Lu, said: I will be more careful every time anyone requests anything. I will give more training to staff - even existing staff - to be more careful. This is the first time this has ever happened to give people meat who do not eat meat.

The small dogsapos bodies can be seen laying over grills as vendors prepare to carve them and serve them at Hanoiaposs aposThit Choapos market restaurants. The images, captured by Josh Edelson who was travelling through the country, show the animalsapos hardened and darkened skin splitting as they are piled on one another. Many of the dogs still have their teeth in place. Josh, from Calornia, said he tried for two day to find vendors who would allow him to film and photograph their dog kebab stalls.  He said: The first time I tried, they shooed me away. They donapost like having photos taken, prob because itaposs a pretty controversial part of their culture - eating dog.apos The locals contend that it is part of their culture and that it should remain. Josh said at one point during a visit to the market, he saw soldiers approach a stall and expected to see them shut it down. However, he was surprised when the soldiers went on to buy some of the dog kebabs. Josh added: I thought [the soldiers] were there to shut it down, but then was surprised to see them buy some. Eating dog is still legal in Southeast Asia, although it is frowned upon and the government has plans to ban its consumption by . However the dog meat industry was said to be booming just a few years ago, with reports of pets being stolen from homes to be turned into food. In , seven tonnes of live dogs were shipped to Hanoi every day, reports the Mail. Most of the shipped animals come from neighbouring Thailand, Cambodia and Laos."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d39d03f8d7785.08994873-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee answer some questions but raise more in win over pars","story":"Dundee really needed that win on Saturday but the last half-hour at home to Dunfermline shows there is a whole lot of work to be done at Dens Park.It looked like being a really good day for the Dark Blues as they romped into a - lead against a team that’s been in really good form.They were heading for a convincing win that would answer a few questions – the near-collapse, though, raises a few more.I was pleased to see them get four goals because that’s something that’s been a real struggle all season, not just finding the net but creating the chances to do that.Dundee boss McPake admits win is important but losing late goals not good enough\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dens-manager-will-address-late-lapse embed # secretxRzVVSWKtd\" data-secret\"xRzVVSWKtd\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"That was a real statement from the attacking players and the manager that they can really hurt teams.Especially against a Pars side that has been in fine form to move above the Dee and into the play-off spots.James McPake’s side are now four points off second thanks to Inverness losing out at Partick Thistle.Realistically, with Dundee United too far in front to catch, that’s only where they need to be going into the business end of the campaign.In touch before building up a head of steam heading into the play-offs and ideally finishing second.They can’t afford more runs like they’ve just been on, however.And that’s where the last half-hour against the Pars brings up some of the same old questions.To be cruising at -, see the opposition reduced to  men and then allow them back into the game is pretty poor.I’m sure the Dens gaffer will be addressing that first thing this week.Jordon Forster has been coming under pressure from home fans after his howler gave Queen of the South victory at Dens the other week.It’s understandable that he’d be a bit shaky in the next home match but he’s going to have deal with that.The doubts will still be there after Stephen Dobbie robbed him but I hope he gets back to the form he showed earlier in the campaign.Sometimesthe same mistakes keep happening, you need taken out of the team but Dundee seem a bit short at centre-back right now.I remember being pulled into the office by Jim Duffy at Dundee and told he wouldn’t play methe same errors kept happening.I was getting sent off a lot and I just needed told by the manager.I’ve no doubt James McPake will be having a similar sort of chat.Overall, though, he’ll be delighted to get back to winning ways and heading in the right direction."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d0c99bf4ca598.39140858-472x564.jpg ","title":"dundee havent shaken off utd loss yet admits midfielder byrne","story":"Shaun Byrne admits Dundee are still to shake off last month’s home derby defeat to rivals Dundee United as they look to end their four-game winless streak tomorrow.Since the - loss to the league leaders, the Dark Blues have managed just one point from the next nine available, losing to Inverness and QOS and drawing at Arbroath last weekend.Next up is a home clash with in-form Dunfermline tomorrow but Byrne is confident the Dens Park side can turn things around and rebuild the belief they had before the loss on November .He told the Tele: “The confidence has dropped massively.“You could see in the three games prior to the United game we were in a really good place and were confident.“I think that defeat hit us hard and we’ve not fully recovered as a team.“In the games after, we lost to Inverness and Queen of the South and you could see the confidence has been hit in the team after those results.“We need to dig in and work hard for each other – we are the only ones able to put it right.“Confidence is probably the biggest thing for a footballer. When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that.

We were over three hours on the bus so it’s a heck of a journey for them.“To come out on a Tuesday night when they’ve probably got work in the morning, it’s a great effort.“If they can stick by us and we continue to churn out results it can only be a good thing.”Smith hailed former Ayr Untied team-mate Shankland for his scoringat Cappielow but reserved special praise for young hitman Appere.“The big man’s done brilliant,” he said of the -year-old.“I wasn’t here when he was out on loan , I’ve only seen him from the start of the season and I’ve been really impressed with him.“His whole game is improving all the time. He’s maybe been stuck out wide a bit just assisting but now he’s getting the goals as well. It’s brilliant for him.“If we can have our three strikers scoring goals it can only be a good thing.“If we can keep producing for them by keeping the goals out at the other end then we’re only going to be going one way.”As they head for Gayfield at the weekend, Smith is keen to make it a perfect three wins from three this week.“It’s another tricky one. Going up there is never easy either and they’re doing really well.“We’re under no illusions how dficult a game that will be.“We’ve been treating every game with the utmost respect to who we’re playing against and,we can keep the run going, then it will stand us in good stead.“Confidence is high, that’s seven wins on the bounce now and  points clear.“If we take it a game at a time now and keep on winning then no one is going to catch us.“That’s what we aim to do – win every game.”Smith is enjoying le on and off the pitch at Tannadice and admits the proximity to home in Fe is a big bonus.“My girlfriend and I moved through so we’re settled and enjoying it.“I’m from Fe so it’s not that far from home either.

north east nurseries","story":"Councillors approved a £, investment to upgrade nurseries in the north-east.The improvements will be made to nurseries at Auchenblae, Drumoak, Hillside and Lairhillock schools, after receiving the backing of Aberdeenshire Council’s Kincardine and Mearns committee.The projects seek to improve the facilities available for children, including upgrades to outdoor spaces.New legislation coming into force in August legally requires nurseries to increase the number of hours offered from  to ,, meaning some early learning centres have to expand their facilities.Supporting the roll-out and development of early years provision in Aberdeenshire ahead of the move, all works are expected to be completed by the end of the Easter holidays.Meanwhile, the committee agreed to appoint Morrison Construction as main contractor to build a nursery at Fishermoss Primary School.This will become the first of the new-build nurseries to be delivered via the , Early Years Programme framework.Work will include construction of a new -place standalone nursery with landscaped outdoor play area, alterations to the existing primary school to upgrade the shared activity spaces and the creation of a new multi-sensory space.Existing temporary accommodations and associated ramps will be demolished.The works are due to start on site next month and are scheduled for completion by August.Committee chairwoman Councillor Wendy Agnew has welcomed the investment in the nursery estate.She said: “These projects represent a tremendous investment in our nursery provision which will benefit future generations of children.”Fellow committee member George Carr, who represents Mearns, said: “It is very much welcomed by the teachers and the community as well.“We opened a new nursery in Inverbervie recently and it’s been a fantastic asset to the school,” he added.A number of nursery expansion projects are under way or have come to fruition across the north-east to cope with the increased demand on facilities.The Scottish Government has provided local authorities across Scotland with an additional £ million per year by -, the first full year of the expansion.Councils will also receive total capital funding of £m over four years to support building projects to expand facilities.In October, Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson opened a £.m extension to Bervie Nursery.The renovation saw a new classroom built and a bigger dining hall, which will now see more children able to enjoy their meals.Other new-build early learning and childcare facilities will be created in Peterhead, Portlethen and Insch.A new school staff room, learning plaza and staff toilets will be created at Westhill Primary, along with a kitchen, extension to the existing toilets and a new large open play room.At Elrick, vinyl flooring will be laid in the playroom to improve flexibility with the floor space available, nappy changing facilities will be built and toilets will be upgraded.Holyrood hopes that by offering more free childcare through the ambitious proposals, parents will find it easier to work or study."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/EE-PG-091219-03-007.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet whiskey jingle and charlie are looking for a new home can you

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

Halftime - for Star.The second half was again dominated by the Lochgilphead boys. The fourth goal was an excellent solo effort from Caskie and effectively killed the game as a contest.Aitken added goal number five when his fierce strike from wide zipped into the net. The sixth and final goal came in the final minutes when the Cathcart keeper parried a long range effort which was pounced on by West who placed the rebound beyond the unlucky goalie.A great result against second placed Cathcart which hopefully sets Star up nicely for the rest of the season."},{"url":null,"title":"salmon company support school beach clean","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowStaff from a nearby salmon company pulled on their yellow gloves to lend a helping hand to Achahoish Primary School pupils as they carried out their annual beach clean.Hendrix Genetics Salmon UK has supported the project for a few years now, as it is very important to it, not only as a company but personally to the staff who live in this part of the world.The beach clean was lead by GRAB Trust’s Kerry MacKay, the beaches and marine litter project worker for Mid Argyll and Kintyre.The main aim of GRAB Trust#s beaches and marine litter project is to raise awareness and educate on the impacts of beach and marine litter, by engaging schools in carrying out regular clean ups and providing fun educational workshops to help understand the problem and mitigate the issues surrounding litter.Together the group surveyed an area of  metres of the beach, sweeping up and down, picking up and recording the litter findings.

He added: #But you can be sure of our desire to stay.#An outstanding relationship has been built up with the local people, and it is a perfect location, with great training facilities.#It is understood that no alternative location for the unit has been identied yet.And RAF spokesman said there had been talks with the US military about the withdrawal.#The future of the base is under continuing review and the departure of the US Navy is not the only factor which has to be taken into account.#In June RAF Machrihanish was reduced to #care and maintenance# status.FIFTY YEARS AGOShellfish plant operationalCampbeltown at last has a stake in the new, growing shellfish processing industry.Two local men, Mr George McMillan and Mr Duncan L. McMillan, have set up a processing plant in the former slaughterhouse buildings, and are employing, at present, three people.Operating under the name Davaar Seafoods, they are consigning to Aberdeen an average of  stones of processed scallops per day. This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F. Machrihanish.The #bus loads of senior citizens were welcomed at the airport by Squadron Leader A. N. McGlashan, on behalf of the station Commanding Officer.Founder member of the club, Mrs M. McKinlay of Stewarton, pressed the button which set off the magnicent fireworks display and bonfire.The station youth group served hot soup and sausage rolls to the visitors and attended to the comfort of the old people.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOth Argylls cadre homeThe cadre of the  th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, consisting of  men and  officers, under command of Major A. Lockie, which left France on Sunday, arrived at the headquarters of the battalion at Dunoon about mid-day on Monday.They were given a hearty welcome when they landed at Dunoon, the Provost, Magistrates and Town Council receiving them officially.Maclachlan of Maclachlan, convener of the county, Colonel H. Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

I think the going rate was £ per day, quite a sum in , and I believe there was quite a queue, unfortunately I couldn#t sign up as I was working at Jaeger.It was quite an event and some friends who were taking part told me later about their experiences with fake blood and bandages etc and others getting kitted out with Russian army unorms and weapons. Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers. Great memories.I also remember the scrapped jet engines from the wrecked airliner lying in McFadyen#s yard in Glebe street for a long time. It was a great movie anyway and anyone who hadn#t heard about it should seek it out to watch.Ron Gay,Dunoon.Broken promiseSir,The Scottish Accident and Emergencywaiting time target has been missed by a long way for yet another month, with only . per cent of patients treated within  hours in September compared to the  per cent target.Doctors and nurses work incredibly hard, but they’re hindered by the SNP government’s poor workforce planning. Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality.

Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It was a massive punch in the gut for Labourrsquos youthful idealists in their Twitter bubble, who canrsquot understand why working-class people would vote for anEton-educated Tory.In Scotland, they didnrsquot. The SNP surprised itself by almost repeating the tsunami SNP surge of . An astonishing achievement for Nicola Sturgeon and confirmation that Scotland and England are growing further apart faster.When Boris Johnson hailed a victory for ldquoone nation Conservatism, he inadvertently spoke the truth. It did apply in only one nation: England. Scotland is now, in a very real sense, another country. There may not be a referendum next year ndash Boris Johnsonrsquos crushing majority in Westminster will see to that. But something will have to give.Resurgent Scottish nationalism, and the most unionist Prime Minister in Westminster since Margaret Thatcher, is an unstable and potentially explosive combination. Everything and anything is now possible, including a court battle over a Scottish referendum. Nicola Sturgeon is demanding that Holyrood gets the power to call referendums. That wonrsquot happen.But donrsquot be surprisedBoris Johnson makes a blue-sky offer of federalism hersquos supported it in the past. As the UK leaves the European Union ndash the one certainty after Thursday ndash Johnson will try to do a side deal with Scotland, as he did with the DUP. Just donrsquot expect it to be all that it seems.Hopes that a hung parliament would deliver a Scottish independence referendum, with the SNP striking a deal with Labour, died on Thursday night. It was curtains too for the Corbyn project. Though there will likely be a continuing civil war in the Labour Party over the succession. Shades again of the s.The first General Election I covered was , so there was a distinct sense of having been through this movie before. Indeed, I wrote in this paper only three weeks ago that Labourrsquos manesto might end up as another ldquolongest suicide note in history. That was how Labourrsquos  effort was famously described by the Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Some left-wing folk said it was somehow morally wrong to criticise that document, with its intergalactic spending plans improbably financed by a % tax hike on people earning over pound,. Imperviousness to constructive criticism has been one of the hallmarks of Corbynism. Labour chose to listen to the hyperventilating keyboard warriors on Twitter who attack anyone deviating from the line as a ldquoTory shill.Yet, it should have been clear to everyone that there was something deeply suspect about Labourrsquos multiple manesto giveaways. The % pay hike for public-sector workers, free broadband, cheap rail fares, the four-day week, the belated bung of pound billion to the Waspi women. This wasnrsquot social democracy, it was retail politics gone mad. It culminated in Labourrsquos promise that every family would be pound, better off. People just arenrsquot that stupid.If Labour had confined itself to a few well-defined and credible offers on health spending, tuition fees and rail nationalisation, it might have worked. Thatrsquos what the Tories did, with their simple message of new hospitals and more nurses. However, the manesto was only part of Labourrsquos problem. Corbyn was also sunk by his policy, or lack of it, on Brexit.How Labour thought that they could win with their leader pretending to have no view on the biggest issue facing the country in half a century defies belief. Again, s of the galaxy on social media insisted that ldquohersquos just being an honest broker ... keeping options open ... uniting the country. Nonsense. It was an irresponsible abdication of leadership. Labourrsquos policy on Brexit was as dishonest as it was cynical. Dishonest: because everyone knew that Jeremy Corbyn was a lelong opponent of the European Union. Cynical: because Labourrsquos metropolitan Remainers hoped ldquoconstructive ambiguity would fool provincial Brexit voters into believing that Corbyn really would renegotiate a better Brexit deal in three months.No-one bought it. The Labour leaderrsquos inability to say who would actually lead his Brexit negotiation, still less campaign for it, was one of the many face-palm moments in a campaign that left my face and palm red raw. Blaming BBC bias only made it worse.Of course, Corbynrsquos personality and style of politics was also aturn-off, and the press made a lot of his past associations with IRA supporters and Hamas. But theyrsquod tried that unsuccessfully in . This time, the Labour leader somehow managed to be even more unpopular in Scotland than his bumptious Etonian Tory rival. How could that possibly be  Hadnrsquot John McDonnell all but promised a second independence referendum  Arenrsquot Scottish voters supposed to be more left-wing The aversion to Corbyn was mostly down to the national question. But I suspect many Scots shared with Labour voters in England an aversion to Corbynrsquos particular brand of London Labour politics. His sympathy, however justied, with the Palestinian cause, obscure LGBTQIA+ demands and, of course, his views on immigration and defence. It left many patriotic provincial voters uncomfortable.This doesnrsquot mean that socially conservative Labour voters are all homophobes and racists. Polls repeatedly confirm that the vast majority of English, and Scots, voters harbour no ill will towards gay people or racial minorities. But they arenrsquot exactly passionate about transgender toilet arrangements or uncontrolled immigration. And millions voted for BrexitThinly-disguised contempt for working-class Brexit voters was evident throughout the campaign. Labour-friendly comedians like Steve Coogan and Nish Kumar condemned them as ldquoignorant and racist. Did they think they werenrsquot listening Labour activists on Twitter talked about the ldquowhite working class astheyrsquore a lumpen mass of unaddressed bigotry. The Corbynite intellectual, Paul Mason, called the election ldquoa victory of the old over the young, racists over people of colour, selfishness over the planet. Not perhaps the best way to attract back core Labour voters in Blyth, Bolsover, Sedgefield.What middle-class intellectuals failed to understand is that, in post-crash Britain, the politics of nation has largely eclipsed the politics of class. The election results north and south of the Border may appear wildly dferent, but they are both expressions of populist nationalism.Brexit is essentially English nationalism. It is a revolt by people the writer David Goodhart calls the ldquosomewheres, in the provinces, against the remain-voting elites, or ldquoanywheres, in urban centres. ldquoSomewheres feel left out by globalisation, as their jobs have gone abroad and mass immigration has altered their communities.Tories since Disraeli have understood the potency of national identity as a unying force. People who lack the mobility conferred by a university education tend to love their country. They have little  to hold on to in an age of insecurity and rapid change. Get Brexit Done was an English version of Make America Great Again.And though the politics are dferent, Brexit is not so far removed from what happened in Scotland during and after the financial crash. In , the Scottish working classes in the housing estates and inner cities entered politics in unprecedented numbers to vote for independence. The Yes campaign was inspired by feelings of national identity, community and Scotsrsquo love of their country. Plus the hope that an independent Scottish Government would look after them better than remote Westminster.It may be naiumlve, it may be nationalistic, it certainly is populist. But identity is a powerful political mobiliser in an age of insecurity and mistrust. People want to belong, to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. National identity gives them that.But the problem with nationalism is that tends to be exclusive. Scotland and England are expressing identity in dferent and contradictory ways ndash the former in a spirit of pro-European internationalism the latter in a more inward-looking, nativist anti-Europeanism. These are irreconcilable opposites.Nicola Sturgeon has often said that she would like to drop the word ldquonational from the SNPrsquos name. She clearly feels uncomfortable with the politics of nationalism, despite having been an SNP supporter all her le. And she has good reason to be wary, given the behaviour of some European nationalist parties.Her task now will be to contain the fervour of her triumphant party and constructively channel their hatred of English conservatism. It wonrsquot be easy. Boris Johnson has provoked the Scots by ruling out any referendum for at least five years. Scotland is about to be dragged kicking and screaming out of Europe.Sturgeon is a cautious politician, unlike her predecessor Alex Salmond, and will not tolerate civil disobedience or unconstitutional behaviour.But like it or not, she has a fight on her hands. A national reckoning is coming."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Seven things we learned from the 2019 election","story":"What we do know for sure, however, is that many folk down south were persuaded that they really, really want Brexit. A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10803331.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-mussel-beds-linked-from-orkney-west-coast","story":"Now scientists are shedding fresh light on the le cycles of the shoe-sized horse mussel, and have uncovered connections between habitats which have never been observed before.A new report published by Scottish Natural Heritageuses state-of-the-art modelling to examine how horse mussel beds around the coasts are linked, as well as examining similar connections between flame shell mussel beds in dferent locations.Researchers found that west coast mussel beds could be connected to other beds as far as Orkney and Noss Head, as larvae ride the prevailing ocean currents and create intermediate beds as ldquostepping-stones along the way.:Scallop dredging devastates rare flame shell reef in the HighlandsMeanwhile flame shell beds - found mostly on the west-coast of Scotland and in Orkneyrsquos Scapa Flow - were found to be generally weakly connected, making them more vulnerable to any local damage.A flame shell mussel.

Seabed surveys in these areas may confirm the model predictions.Horse Mussels are similar to the blue mussels found on seashores but grow much larger, and can reach more than cm inand live for over  years.They live inidually or in clumps, or may form raised beds with several hundreds of mussels per square metre.Horse mussels live below the low water mark, with beds found at depths from  to  metres, although most known beds are between - metres.:Revealing the secrets of mussels as big as size nine shoes#The beds provide a foundation for soft corals, tubeworms, barnacles, sea firs, sea mats and seaweeds, as well as shelter for brittlestars, crustaceans, worms, molluscs and many other small animals.Flame shells, bivalve molluscs with a fringe of orange tentacles, live hidden on the seabed in nests which they build from shells, stones and other materials. Hundreds of nests can combine to form a dense bed, which stabilises the seabed and provides substrate for sea firs, sea mats, sea squirts and seaweed, as well as shelter for many other creatures, such as crabs, scallops and brittle stars.The habitat is found mainly on the west coast of Scotland, often in tidal narrows and the entrances to sea lochs, with the largest known flame shell bed in Loch Carron. There is also a flame shell bed in Scapa Flow on Orkney.In recent years both have come under threat due to dredging that scours the seabed in the search for fresh mussels.In July Marine Scotland said it was looking into claims an industrial vessel was last week scraping the bottom of Loch Broom near the Summer Isles.A er inspects damage to the mussel beds in Loch Carron.

For some, Brexit represents a lsquomaterial change in circumstancersquo. For others, lsquoonce in generationrsquo still holds.ldquoMany of the economic debates will be similar to those in . But there are likely to be important dferences.ldquoFirstly, back in  there was a clear choice between a relatively stable lsquostatus quorsquo ndash albeit with the promise of more devolved powers ndash and independence.ldquoBut with Brexit, the debate will be set against the backdrop of economic change and uncertainty whatever the people of Scotland decide.ldquoVoters will also want to be much more mindful about what both sides can credibly say about their so-called Plan B than was the case in either  or the EU Referendum in .ldquoThe wider economic context has undoubtedly changed. Some aspects ndash such as the sharp fall in oil prices and weakening of Scotlandrsquos relative fiscal position ndash pose a challenge to those arguing in favour of independence.ldquoAgainst that, Brexit throws up economic challenges for those in favour of the Union.ldquoScotland may face a stark choice between aligning to the EU trading bloc or the UK bloc, with implications for trade and migration.ldquoPerhaps most signicantly, many of those on the Yes side in  argued that there would be a degree of continuity between the then status quo and independence. The plan was to retain sterling, share financial regulation and keep an open border.ldquoButthe case for a second referendum is now framed around Scotland pro-actively taking a dferent path to the UK, then it necessarily follows that the economic proposition for independence will need to be more radical on issues such as currency, customs and fiscal policy than in .In October, Ms Sturgeon refused to rule out infrastructure and customs checksBrexit was combined with Scottish independence in Europe.Her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell also admitted the EU could impose a hard border, saying it would be ldquogoverned by our membership of the EU, not settled domestically.:Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal to be brought before Commons this weekThe Institutersquos commentary also warned of continued weak Scottish economic growth, with forecasts of . per cent for  and .% for  and , although these assumed Ms Johnson could deliver on his promise of a trade deal with the EU by the endof .Speaking ahead of her parliamentary statement, the First Minister said: ldquoThis election result is a watershed moment for Scotland. People were faced with a clear and distinct choice, and they made their verdict clear - they have rejected a Tory government, said no to Brexit and endorsed the proposition that they should be given a say on their own future.ldquoThat position is increasingly winning support from across the political spectrum, including from senior and prominent members of the Scottish Labour Party, who may not yet back independence but who recognise the fundamental democratic principle which is now at stake.ldquoIn  when we were also facing the prospect of a fourth Tory government with no mandate in Scotland there was a coming together of parties, communities and civic Scotland.ldquoThat resulted in the establishment of this Parliament, which has achieved much. But this new wave of Brexiteer Tories with a mission to reshape Scotland and the UK in their right-wing image presents a new danger ndash one that very few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution.

The debate is over but the ide remains.We know too in Scotland that young people are both the most pro-EU and the most pro-independence. And polls, in the last year, have found majorities for independenceBrexit happens. New polls in the coming weeks will be closely watched to seethat sht on the independence question now does show up. If it does, that will add fuel to the Scottish Governmentrsquos current demand for a second independence referendum.But in the weeks, months and years ahead, Britainnow faces a Tory hard Brexit, driven by the combined forces of a populist Tory majority in England, by an English and Welsh Leave vote in , and by an English identity crisis. Yet England, like the UK, will remain bitterly ided too, with fragmentation likely only to increase in the years ahead.A Tory Brexit led by Boris Johnson has no chance of healing such a UK. Divisions over the EU, deep dferences between young and old, profound changes in the Britain-Northern Ireland relationship, and more deep isions between England and Wales, and between England and Scotland, are a recipe for an unsettled, unstable politics ahead.

Brexit is coming, and Boris Johnson is in Number . The triumph of English nationalism at the General Election is a great threat to Scotland, and will cost us dearwe do not resist it with every democratic means at our disposal.Not only does Scotland have to face being ripped from the European Union against the will of the nation, but we also have the injustice of Westminster silencing the democratic voice of the Scottish people.The SNP won an astonishing majority of seats at the election. It fought a campaign which hammered home that the nation was lied to at the last independence referendum ndash that we were misled when we were told a No vote was the only way to preserve EU membership. After the EU referendum, circumstances obviously changed and a second independence vote was morally justied. The SNP won on this premise ndash yet wersquore told by Johnson therersquoll be no second independence referendum.Brexit alone is grounds enough for a second independence referendum. The SNPrsquos electoral mandate makes the argument unassailable.An election which confirms the democratic will of the English people is being used to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people. Would the English tolerate such abuse  Itrsquos not hyperbole to say the treatment of Scotland in the first few days of the new Johnson administration smells of tyranny and bodes ill for the future. Itrsquos a clear-cut case of political injustice.This treatment is designed to provoke anger. The Yes movement needs to resist being needled into intemperate behaviour. Already, some voices on the fringes of the Yes movement, or within the SNPrsquos more hysterical base, have began talking of action like a unilateral declaration of independence.Such language is not welcome. The reason the SNP did so well in this election is that the broader Yes movement followed a policy of moderation over the last four years. The leadership wisely avoided the flag-waving, old-school nationalist marches of outfits like All Under One Banner, which seems to attract more than its fair share of cranks and zealots.:Yes vote would be more disruptive after Brexit than in \"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"description\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ncqRYhbm poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ncqRYhbm.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Leaders of the SNP and the Yes movement chose to focus on a policy of wooing undecided Scottish voters and soft No voters. It was emollient, open, nuanced, intelligent and unaggressive.The tactic seemed to represent the split in the SNP and the Yes movement mirrored by the personalities of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. Those of a populist persuasion still pine for the bluster of a man like Salmond. This is the brittle SNP base, represented by the online, angry fringe. They achieved nothing in this election. They won over not a single voter. Itrsquos likely thatthey didnrsquot exist at all, the SNPrsquos majority would be even higher than it is today.What secured the SNP electoral victory was the careful, modulated, well-mannered message put out by the leadership. Nicola Sturgeon may have briefly lost her usual dignied composure when she jumped for joy at the sight of Jo Swinsonrsquos defeat on election night politics is played to be won after all but the consistent message throughout the campaign was measured, unthreatening and reassuring.As a result, soft unionists and undecided voters have leant their support to the SNP in order to register opposition to Brexit and Johnsonrsquos hard-right politics. Thatrsquos an act of great trust and they should be applauded for their political bravery. They mustnrsquot be betrayed. Theyrsquove taken the first step on a new journey and must be encouraged towards full support of independence.The policy of moderation has also left the Scottish Labour Party seemingly on the verge of rethinking its entire position on the constitution. Along with continually pressing for moderation among the Yes movement, Irsquove also spoken in this column of the need for Labour to moderate its position on Scottish independence. Today, senior Labour figures are now in favour of a second referendum.The SNP and the Yes movement now sit securely atop the moral high ground. The battle was fought with decency and it paid off. Meanwhile, Johnson and his government treat Scotland with contempt yet we cannot allow understandable anger to undermine that moral high ground.My first emotional reaction to Johnsonrsquos denial of a second referendum was anger. Not only did I feel Scotland was now a hostage to his government ndash hijacked and taken in the boot of his car to Brexitland ndash but the hypocrisy was astonishing. England can get its way, but not Scotland ndash that was the message. Democracy for England do as yoursquore told for Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon at the Glasgow count during the General Election  :Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for For a few hours I felt the only answer was to call another referendum whether Westminster liked it or not. But some calm reflection proved just what folly that would be. All the hard work of moderation and measure would be for nothingwe allow ourselves to be riled and act emotionally. Letrsquos avoid the road to Catalonia.The Yes movement must continue the policy of moderation here at home ndash in order to maintain momentum and trust ndash but when Scotland directs its face to Johnson in London there must be only implacable resistance and demand. If Johnson intends to harm Scotland by preventing our voice being heard, then harm him back. Obstruct his government in any way possible. Take his government to courtneeds be to secure a second referendum.Conservative hostility, however, means itrsquos highly unlikely that wersquoll see another referendum until after the next Holyrood election ndash theyrsquoll ly deny any mandate exists until success in  makes such fiction no longer sustainable.What matters most is sustaining that intelligent and dignied composure at home, while never relenting when it comes to fighting the hypocrisy and abuse of democracy emanating from London.

It has achieved much.\"But a new, Brexit-focused Tory Government presents risks that few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution.\"So I hope in the coming days and weeks we will see a similar coming together around the idea of Scotlands right to choose a better future.\"She said there was also a need to overcome the immediate challenges of Brexit.She said: ldquoTo that end, just as we did in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in , the Scottish government will in January convene a number of round table meetings, bringing together key groups that represent dferent aspects of Scottish le.ldquoThis will include civic society, trade unions and the business community, religious and minority groups and our partners in local government.The Scottish Government said in October that it could not recommend Holyrood consents to the Withdrawal Bill as it would result in a Brexit that did ldquosignicant damage to Scotland.Although Westminster could pass and impose the legislation without Holyroodrsquos consent, it would cause a political storm as it would be a breach of the Sewel Convention that Westminster does not ldquonormally legislate in devolved areas without Holyroodrsquos approval.Westminster has only imposed legislation in this way once before since  - when it passed the first EU Withdrawal Bill despite opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoNow it seems the Prime Minister is determined to quickly push through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.ldquoThis Parliament will have to consider whether or not it will give consent to this Bill.ldquoIf the UK Government was to press ahead without that consent it would be further proof of Westminsterrsquos contempt for devolution and its willingness to tear up established constitutional rules in its pursuit of Brexit.Ms Sturgeon also repeatedly criticised the Scottish Tories for continuing to oppose Indyref despite it being the focus of an election campaign which cost them most of their  MPs.:Boris Johnson voices fresh opposition to indyref in phone call with Nicola SturgeonShe said: ldquoThe election was comprehensively won in Scotland by the SNP. Indeed, you have to go as far back as the election of Ted Heath in  - the year I was born - to find a party that got a higher share of the vote across the UK than the SNP did in Scotland last week.ldquoThat is, by any measure, a signicant vote of confidence. It was also an endorsement of our election message - that Scotland does not want a Boris Johnson government and we donrsquot want to leave the EU and that, while opinions may dfer on the substantive question of independence, we do want Scotlandrsquos future to be in Scotlandrsquos hands.ldquoBy contrast, while the Conservative Party won a majority UK wide, they were once again heavily defeated here in Scotland, having fought the election on the single issue of opposition to an independence referendum.ldquoIn fact, the Conservatives have now lost  consecutive Westminster elections in Scotland ndash stretching back to . But in spite of that, we face a majority Tory government implementing a manesto that Scotland rejected.ldquoThis election demonstrated a fundamental point. The kind of future desired by most people in Scotland is very clearly dferent to that favored by much of the rest of the UK.ldquoIt is essential therefore that a future outside of Europe and governed by an increasingly right wing Conservative government is not foisted upon Scotland.ldquoInstead, we must have the right to consider the alternative of independence.Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said: ldquoWhat this election has confirmed beyond doubt or debate is that the whole of the United Kingdom together will be leaving the European Union at the end of next month. The campaign to stop it happening has failed, our departure is going ahead and the result of the  UK referendum will be respected.\"He added: \"Brexit is no longer a what-, it is a political reality for us all. The whole of the UK together will now enter the period of transition and leave on the basis of the future trading arrangements with our EU partners negotiated next year.\"Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoI say to Jackson Carlaw, for him to stand up in this chamber and gloat about the fact that every part of the UK will be leaving the EU together is a disgrace.ldquo It is a democratic disgrace that Scotland faces being dragged out of the European Union against our will.ldquoThat is why we should have a choice over a better future, andthe Scottish Conservatives had any respect whatsoever for democracy, thatrsquos exactly what we would have.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said his party was happy to support the Scottish Governmentrsquos demand for a seat at the table during Brexit trade negotiations.He said: ldquoWe are happy to work on a cross-party basis as we did [in the early s]. We will work on a cross-party basis to resist the attacks that Boris Johnson will wage on the people.ldquoBut there is a fundamental dference compared to . We now have this parliament.ldquoWill the First Minister use all the powers of this parliament as part of that campaign of resistance She replied: ldquoYes, I will. I welcome any attempt to work on a cross-party basis to that effect, and I will reach out to anybody in this chamber who wants to do that.ldquoWhen push comes to shove, Richard Leonard is happier with a Conservative government at Westminster than self-government for Scotland.ldquoBut for all of that, the point which we should be able to unite around is this - itrsquos not for me to decide that, itrsquos not for Richard Leonard, Jackson Carlaw, or Boris Johnson to decide whether or not Scotland should become independent.ldquoIt is for the Scottish people to decide. My party has a mandate to offer that choice and I know there are many voices, which I welcome, in Scottish Labour saying that that mandate should be respected, and I think Richard Leonard should reflect very, very carefully on that point.However it also emerged Labour MSPs have been ordered to vote against the legislation paving the way for Indyref when it comes to its final stage at Holyrood on Thursday.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie was jeered by SNP MSPs for pointing out many SNP candidates tried to downplay the prospect of Indyref in the election.He said: ldquoI congratulate the First Minister on achieving % of those who voted but can I question whether all those who voted for her party voted for another independence referendum  John Nicholson failed to mention independence on his campaign leaflet setting out ldquoSNP priorities.\"Richard Thomson said lsquoA vote for me.. is not is a vote for Scottish independence and I will never, ever, try and claim it as such.rsquo\"Surely the First Minister must see that the country has had enough of the ision, that we need to learn the lessons of Brexit not repeat them with independence and she failed to persuade even half of those who voted that there should be another referendum \"Ms Sturgeon replied: \"The Conservatives and the Liberals lost the election in terms of the share of the vote and of the percentage of seats that were won by the SNP. Both are higher than what Boris Johnson got, which he is claiming is a mandate to Get Brexit done.\"Their contempt for democracy is not making those parties seem tough - it is making them seem ridiculous. The more contempt they show for Scottish democracy, the more support for Scottish independence will rise.\"Scottish SecretaryAlister Jack said:ldquoPeople in Scotland are fed up with constant ision and uncertainty. That is why we will not support the First Ministerrsquos plans for another unwanted referendum on separation.ldquoWe want  to be a year of growth and opportunity for Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom - not more political wrangling and wasteful debate.We will unleash the potential of every part of the UK and focus on the issues that matter - boosting jobs and helping with the cost of living.ldquoRemaining part of a strong United Kingdom is worth more than poundbn in public spending in Scotland each year, and through the latest spending round Scotland will receive a further pound.bn cash boost.Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie said his party was ldquomore than ready to campaign again for Scotlandrsquos future to be decided by the people who live here, and for independence to be the path that we choose. We are ready for that campaign to begin, and wersquore ready to win that campaign.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon is trying to sound reasonable, but what she is saying is anything but. ldquoThe General Election result did not provide her with a mandate for a isive and unwanted second independence referendum.ldquoMs Sturgeon has made clear that votes for the SNP in last weekrsquos election were not a vote for Scotland leaving the UK.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stood as an independent candidate in the  General Election, receiving  votes — despite making previous comments to The Orcadian that the election was #illegal#.But SIC has said that placards erected in Shetland by Mr Hill were #unauthorised#, in that he had not sought prior approval before erecting them.In a press release issued on behalf of the #Sovereign Nation of Shetland#, Mr Hill claimed that the SIC roads department had carried out its #threat# to remove his election signs — which he believes it had no authority to do.He said: “Apparently the left hand doesn#t know what the right hand is doing and neither has the authority to do anything. This is just a strong arm tactic from those who want our message suppressed.#It has long been customary to put up signs on lamp posts at election time and when I was a candidate, no permission was asked and no objections were made. As for not being a candidate – that is nonsense.#I have a message just as valid as any candidate for those wanting to make a legitimate protest vote about the £ million Shetland and Orkney pay to the UK every year for nothing in . Rather than vote in an MP, who can do nothing about it, people should write NO THANX across the ballot paper to keep the power here. All spoiled papers are counted.#The SIC did not have the authority to take down my signs. I will be charging them for doing so. Supporters have rallied round and new ones will be printed and re-erected today. We will not be bullied by those who do not like our message.”Responding to Mr Hill#s comments, a spokeswoman from SIC said:#The road service of the council is in communication with Mr Hill over the matter of unauthorised placards, but we will not publicly comment at this point.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ministry said the discovery was particularly important as it shed light on the early phases of Greecersquos Mycenaean civilisation.The Mycenaean era, between roughly - BC provided the material for many of the myths and legends of ancient Greece including that of the Trojan War.The larger of the two tombs had a diameter of  metres at floor level and its stone walls survived to a height of . metres mdash less than half its original height. The other was about two-thirds of that size and its walls now stand two meters high. Both belong to the tholos type of tomb, massive domed underground constructions reserved for Mycenaean royalty that could reach roughly  metres in height.They were excavated over the past two years by University of Cincinnati archaeologists, who also discovered the nearby rich burial that is known as the Grfin Warrior grave, after some of the ornaments found in it.All three graves, together with another tholos tomb found nearby decades ago, were built earlier than the sprawling palace whose ruins lie close by, and which features in Homerrsquos Odyssey as the seat of the wise King Nestor.copy -.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

The SNP had originally been involved in the Convention, but pulled out when it did not discuss independence as a constitutional option.Richard Leonard said he would be happy to work on a cross-party basis to \"resist the attacks that Boris Johnson will wage on the people\", but urged Ms Sturgeon to use the powers of the Scottish parliament to do so.He said: \"The Scottish Labour Party is happy to to support the Scottish Government demands to have a seat at the table in the Brexit negotiations, after last Thursday thats more important than ever.

We will unleash the potential of every part of the UK and focus on the issues that matter - boosting jobs and helping with the cost of living.“Remaining part of a strong United Kingdom is worth more than £ billion in public spending in Scotland each year, and through the latest spending round Scotland will receive a further £. billion cash boost.”The First Minister also revealed that she would invite representatives from across Scottish society to identy responses to the UK election result, and to the prospect of Scotland leaving the European Union. Discussions with groups from across civic society will begin in January and will include trades unions, the business community, local government, and religious and minority groups.The meetings will echo those held after the Brexit referendum in , and will identy how, within the Scottish Parliament’s current powers, Scotland responds to the impact of UK Government actions including the imminent prospect of Brexit. She also said the Scottish Government would engage with the Standing Council on Europe, so that Scotland retains its relationships and voice in Europe.“It is clear that Scotland must engage with the range of challenges facing us now - as well as discuss what kind of future we wish to create as a nation together,\" she said.“The General Election result has made it clear that the future desired by most people in Scotland is dferent to the type of future chosen by the rest of the UK. That is why it is so important that the breadth and depth of civic Scotland urgently face up to, and respond to, these challenges.“Just as we did in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in , the Scottish Government will in January convene a number of round table meetings, bringing together key groups that represent dferent areas of Scottish le.“I hope in the days and weeks ahead, we will see a coming together around the idea that Scotland has a right to choose a better future.”But Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “Nicola Sturgeon is trying to sound reasonable, but what she is saying is anything but.The General Election result did not provide her with a mandate for a isive and unwanted second independence referendum.“Ms Sturgeon has made clear that votes for the SNP in last week’s election were not a vote for Scotland leaving the UK.“Yet she is proposing to keep the focus of government, Parliament and the civil service on trying to get another unwanted, isive referendum when our public services are crumbling and in dire need of attention.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2485-Kylerhea-landslip.jpg","title":"skye visitors cooking class on the back burner following kylerhea","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineDaniela Celant left her holiday home in Kylerhea to drive to Kinloch Lodge earlier this afternoon to take part in a cooking class with top chef Marcello Tully.

However, a majority of those over believe their cultural identity is respected.Dficult subject: Gladys Ganiel discusses faith in her new book“I’m surprised young people are less likely to think their identity is being respected because they started from a dferent place,” said Dr Ganiel.“The older generation remembers more of the bad old days and recognise that things have got better whereas younger people have an expectation that they should be more respected and are disappointed that they are not.”The latest report shows % of men and % of women feel their cultural identity is not given the respect it deserves.“There are people who would say religion is very important to them and with increased secularisation and reduced influence of the church, people coming from a Christian perspective think their religion isn’t as respected as it used to be,” Dr Ganiel continued.She said she knew of people from a non-Christian faith background that felt their religion was not respected or acknowledged in the public sphere.“They have a feeling of being overlooked as well as overt discrimination. Invisibility can be painful and disempowering,” she said.She said there’s a dference between those who see their religion as cultural and those who see it as a matter of faith.“I think we need to be cognisant thatpeople have a perspective and it’s just as valid for them to participate in the public sphere, with voices of faith and voices of non-faith,” Dr Ganiel said.As part of the same survey, it was revealed that almost three in  adults said they didn’t believe facilities where they live — such as leisure centres, parks, libraries and shopping centres — are “shared and open”."},{"url":null,"title":"refusal of fai to attend oireachtas committee an insult","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I want us to have the smoothest possible transition for the sake of the party as a whole and for those Labour mayors and councillors who are up for re-election in May.”Mr Corbyn maintained his defence that Brexit was a major reason voters lost their trust in Labour and repeated his criticism of the media.“The Tory campaign amplied by most of the media managed to persuade many that only Boris Johnson could ‘get Brexit done’.

It was a generalised apology for the situation that he appears to have found himself in.”Former shadow work and pensions shadow Rachel Reeves said she told the meeting Labour needs “radical change” and get a leader “that actually wants to win”.“If we want to change the lives of the people we came into politics to serve then we’ve got to win power and that’s not been possible two times under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership,” Ms Reeves told reporters.Earlier in the day Mr Corbyn was confronted by former Labour shadow cabinet member Mary Creagh, who lost her Wakefield seat, after she cleared out her parliamentary office.She told Channel  News she criticised the leader for having “enabled a hard Brexit” and “five years of austerity”."},{"url":null,"title":"animals enjoy christmas treats at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Particularly in the dark winter mornings and evenings where visibility from oncoming traffic makes it crucial that school children have adequate, safe areas for boarding and enlightening from their school buses”“DfI and Translink have agreed to provide additional ‘Bus Stop’ safety signs and to create a hard standing area on a verge embankment at the junction of Rocktown and Hillhead Road for children to use when embarking off buses. Additional safety signage warning motorists off the bus stop and children on the carriageway will also be installed at the Carnaman Mayogall Road junction. In addition to these measures I also wish to thank Mid-Ulster District Council for agreeing to my request to have a school bus shelter installed at Ballymcpeake Mayogall Road junction. All of these measures will enhance the conditions our schoolchildren endure when going to and from their schools” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is open to the public. The full motion successfully moved at the October full Council meeting by People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin appears below. Cllr Harkin proposed a representative of the Fire Brigades Union also be invited to the December full Council meeting. The meeting will hear from health, nurses, civil servant, teacher, lecturer, postal and fire service union representatives. People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin said: In October the full Derry and Strabane Council agreed to a People Before Profit motion to give its full backing to workers taking strike action and to invite trade union representatives to a special meeting of the Council. googletag.cmd.push Workers representatives will now have the opportunity to speak directly to the full Council. Nurses, health service workers and manyothers have been forced to take action for pay justice and to stand up for public services. Its right that our Council support their action and stand in solidarity with them. People deserve respect, justice and dignity for the essential work they do. Our Council should be loudly amplying demands for workers rights and in defence of our public services. Strike action is most often a last resort but its one of the most powerful weapons ordinary people have to press their demands. Picket lines across the North are sending a clear message to Westminster and Stormont that years of cuts must end. Strike action has become necessary because standing up for ordinary people hasnt been a priority. googletag.cmd.push The Tories will now believe they have a greenlight to continue their assault on ordinary people and public services. People power, like we are seeing now from nurses, civil servants and others, will be necessary to stop them. Ordinary people are going to need to stick together to resist what Boris Johnson and the political establishment has in store. Well need to fight very hard to end the decade of cuts that have left many with poverty pay and our public services under severe strain. Motion to Derry and Strabane Council in October from Cllr Shaun Harkin: Councilsupports our Postal Workers who overwhelmingly voted to take strike action in defence of their jobs, conditions and public service ethos. Councilstands in solidarity with our Nurses and all Health Service workers in their vote to take strike action for pay equality. Our postal workers, nurses, health service workers, civil servants and teachers provide essential services, care and amenities that every community depends on.Councilopposes attacks on workers rights and our public services. Councilwill invite representatives from the postal workers, civil servants, health care and education unions to make presentations to a Special meeting ofCouncil.

The neighbourly gathering bringing together the Cromore Beatles, Gerry Cassidy, Barry Donaghy and Didi Semple- who both played their own set and backed golden-voiced Anne Tracey all to warm applause.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The gig will take place on Saturday December .  ‘Christmas with The Swingtime Starlets’ in the hotel’s Corinthian Ballroom invites the public to enjoy a four course meal and boogie the night away as OrlaMullan, Rosie Barry and Colette Lennon Dougal add a festive twist to their popular vintage repertoire.  Inspired mainly by s swing and boogie woogie specialists The Andrews Sisters, the girls also move up the eras and pay homage to the girl groups and as who followed such as Ella Fitzgerald, the McGuire Sisters, The Ronettes, The Chfons and Etta James. googletag.cmd.push  “It’s our first time bringing our Christmas show to Derry and we really just want people to come and enjoy a delicious meal and great music with family and friends,” explained founder member Orla.  “Our primary aim with each performance is to put a smile on people’s faces and provide an evening of entertainment that brings pure joy to our audience.  “The main piece of feedback we get most often, outside of our music, is how much fun we are having on stage and that it’s infectious  “We literally have people aged between  to  at our gigs and always,we are having fun, that transports through to the audience and onto the dance floor.” googletag.cmd.push  Formed in , the Starlets were already friends through their professional careers as actors and singers.  Highlights to date include selling out the Empire Music Hall and Black Box stages in Belfast and performing with a live brass band at the Walled City Tattoo in the Millennium Forum.  “We wanted to create something that was firstly, a lot of fun to be part of and secondly, something that was a little bit dferent, both musically and aesthetically,” Orla continued.  “I had always been a huge fan of the wartime, swing and big band eras and having performed a similar set of music a few years ago, it inspired me and the group developed from there.  “For me, trying to recreate that vintage sound and bring it back to le is the biggest joy - to get to do it with your friends as The Swingtime Starlets, is the added bonus.  “We are all currently involved in acting projects - Rosie is currently playing Pablo’s Mum on the CBeebies series ‘Pablo’, Colette is performing at the Lyric in ‘Peter Pan’ and I have just completed filming for the third season of ‘Marcella’ starring Anna Friel for ITV Netflix.   “So for us, it is the perfect outlet to utilise our vocal skills and love of music alongside our other acting work - and we absolutely love it!”  Christmas with the Swingtime Starlets takes place in the City Hotel on Saturday December  at .pm.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes across the Province, with the remainder of the cash expected to come from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.At this weekrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements.

Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
