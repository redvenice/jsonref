Enquiries remain ongoing and officers will review whether any further action needs to be taken in due course.\u0027Astonished locals have spoken of their shock at hearing of the discovery from last week.One resident joked that the garage had been owned by the notorious Kray twins at one point, and some people believe the bones could be from a churchyard.

The fact they are in black bags definitely makes me think something suspicious has happened.\u0027 Another local, a 79-year-old woman who asked not to be named, said: \u0027I was absolutely shocked when I heard what had happened, and that\u0027s been the feeling among neighbours too. It\u0027s worrying.\u0027Canterbury Archaeological Trust\u0027s archives manager Andrew Richardson previously confirmed the remains were from multiple people.He said: \u0027There are quite a few bones there - we think at least four iniduals based on the number of long bones, perhaps more.\u0027A source at the building site previously told Kent Live the bones could have been from as many as six people, based on the number of fragments. It is not clear how many bones were in the second bag, or why they were buried, but black plastic bags first came into use in the 1950s. "},{"url":null,"title":"Teslas new CFO Zach Kirkhorn fresh faced 34 year old","story":"Elon Musk announced the CFO shift in the final moments of an earnings conference call on Wednesday night, saying 56-year-old Deepak Ahuja would be handing over the reins to 34-year-old Zach KirkhornThe 34-year-old started at Tesla in 2010 as a senior analyst but left briefly to complete an MBA at Harvard Business School.He returned in 2011 as a senior manager in finance and has been promoted to director, senior director and vice president of finance in the nine years that followed. His job out of school in 2007 was with McKinsey \u0026amp Co. Kirkhorn will step into the CFO role after several months of grooming by his predecessor, Bloomberg reports. Ahuja initially retired from Tesla back in 2015 but returned when his successor, Jason Wheeler, left after 15 months. Musk said Ahuja will go back into retirement after Kirkhorn takes the reins but will stay on as a senior advisor for several years.           Elon Musk has revealed on Wednesday that the 34-year-old would be taking over as Teslas\u0027s chief financial officer in a shock announcement that sent shares tumbling          \u0027Super appreciate Deepak\u0027s 11 year history building Tesla \u0026amp wish him greatest of happiness in retirement!

Difference is beautiful - and together is beautiful too.\u0027 MICHELOB ULTRA  Michelob Ultra, which features Colombian singer Maluma, looked to the future to try and promote its light beer on Super Bowl Sunday. The ad imagines a world where robots walk among humans and, for the most part, outperform us. They are running faster than us on morning jogs, golfing better than us, and killing it at spin class. But when one robot passes by a bar, where friends are sharing a few pints together, one major flaw is revealed - they can\u0027t enjoy a beer. \u0027It\u0027s only worth it, if you can enjoy it,\u0027 the ad reads. And, looking to cash-in on the online phenomenon that has become ASMR videos, Michelob also aired a second ad featuring actress Zoe Kravtiz. As with the viral videos, the commercial features her talking in a hushed voice accompanied by delicate sounds that advocates say can produce \u0027brain orgasms\u0027.THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUEThe National Football League\u0027s Super Bowl commercial featuring past and current legends is winning near-unanimous applause.The two-minute ad, which was directed by acclaimed Hollywood filmmaker Peter Berg, includes cameos by a number of the game\u0027s greats, including Peyton Manning, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, and others.  The commercial featured more than 50 active and retired players. It was created to celebrate the NFL\u0027s centennial season, which begins later this year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. BURGER KINGBurger King may have won the contest for the edgiest and most original Super Bowl commercial idea on Sunday thanks to its ad featuring Andy Warhol chowing down on a Whopper.The fast food chain\u0027s 45-second spot features Warhol, the artist credited for spearheading the pop art movement of the 1960s, quietly feasting on a burger.Warhol doesn\u0027t make any noise except to briefly express frustration because the ketchup won\u0027t quickly emerge from the Heinz bottle.\u0027It doesn\u0027t come out,\u0027 Warhol says in the clip. PAMPERS   Adam Levine has joined John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen to remix Legend\u0027s Stinky Booty Duty song in a new Pampers Super Bowl commercial.The original Stinky Booty Duty song debuted last June, with Legend singing to his young daughter Luna while changing her diaper as other dads chimed in.The remix, dubbed Stinky Booty Duty 2.0, features Legend, 40, changing his eight month old son Miles\u0027 diaper, getting an assist from Luna and some vocal help from several other dads, including Maroon 5 front man Adam Levine.When Legend takes off Miles\u0027 diaper, he says he\u0027s gonna need some \u0027back-up on this one,\u0027 as Luna peels off some Pampers wipes, before turning to a group of random dads who have their kids strapped to them in baby carriers. Apparently all these dads can hold a tune and harmonize as well, as they start singing the Stinky Booty Duty song, with a surprise appearance from Adam Levine towards the end. HULU - HANDMAID\u0027S TALE  The streaming service pulled perhaps the best bait-and-switch of any Super Bowl ad by starting off their slot with star Elizabeth Moss looking hopefully out of a window as the opening lines of Ronald Reagan\u0027s \u0027Morning in America\u0027 speech are read.But things turn dark fast as scenes from the dystopian TV series are spliced over the top of the President\u0027s stirring speech, before Moss takes over for the last line, saying: \u0027Wake up, America. Morning\u0027s over.\u0027MICROSOFT Microsoft\u0027s tear-jerker of an ad showed off its specially adapted gaming controller, which allows a disabled child to play video games with his friends.But there was a larger message at play: namely the things that technology can do for people, both in terms of making their lives easier and bringing them together.GOOGLE The tech giant aired two adverts during the game, the first of which focused on how its search engine can be used to put veterans back to work.The second ad promoted its Google Translate service and pointed out that although \u0027words can hurt and sometimes ide,\u0027 the most translated words in the world are \u0027How are you,\u0027 \u0027Thank you\u0027 and \u0027I love you.\u0027Kim Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia, said the ad was an example of how the night\u0027s \u0027most powerful ads focused on unity, positivity and commonality.\u0027MINT MOBILE The wireless provider was trying to stand out from larger rivals Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. But the \u0027gross-out\u0027 route may not have been the way to do it.The ad compares Mint Mobile\u0027s $20-a-month wireless plan with \u0027chunky milk,\u0027 then it shows a fake ad with a family drinking the unappetizing beverage. A mint-colored cartoon fox says the milk is \u0027not right,\u0027 but Mint Mobile\u0027s plan \u0027is right.\u0027TURKISH AIRLINES Turkish Airlines created a trailer for a six-minute short directed by Ridley Scott, known for directing Apple\u0027s iconic 1984 ad. It was the storied director\u0027s first return to the Super Bowl in decades. But some viewers took to Twitter to express confusion over what exactly the ad was trying to promote.CBS - TWILIGHT  ZONEAnother highly-convincing bait-and-switch advert, it appeared to show the game had restarted in Atlanta before cutting to an empty stadium with Jordan Peele standing in the middle.\u0027Witness an empty space, filled with thousands of screaming people,\u0027 Peele says in calming Twilight Zone toned voice.He adds: \u0027A man both nowhere and everywhere at the same time,\u0027 as he sits in several different seats, and stands on the field, all at the same time.\u0027Answers are new questions,\u0027 he reads on to a shot of the familiar Twilight Zone spiral tunnel. \u0027The unthinkable is the expected.\u0027He concludes with: \u0027When truth is not the truth, what dimensions are you even in?\u0027TURBOTAX The sinister nature of artificial intelligence featured heavily in Super Bowl ads, perhaps exemplified best by Turbotax\u0027s robo-child who yearns to do taxes.SIMPLISAFE Simplisafe also produced a fear-laden advert for its Super Bowl slot, playing on anxieties ranging from the news, to other humans and AI once again.The message: Simplisafe can protect you from everything nasty in the world outside, which happens to be everything in the world outside. SPRINTSprint\u0027s robots were some of the few to feature in Super Bowl ads without sinister overtones, helping to come up with a bizarre concept for a commercial that features Bo Jackson, holding a mermaid, playing a keytar, next to a bird-horse.Instead, Bo suggests they should just keep it simple by pointing out that Sprint can save people a lot of money when it comes to their phones.PRINGLES Pringles also went down the AI route, with two men stacking up the chips in different flavor combinations before wondering aloud how many combinations there are.A smart microphone then pipes up from the corner to answer the question, before going off on a tangent about how she will never taste any of them. She says: \u0027I have no hands to stack with, no mouth to taste with, no soul to feel with, I am at the mercy of a cruel and uncaring...\u0027 \u0027Cool, play Funky Town,\u0027 one of the men cuts in.WIX.COM Relying on star power to get their message across, website building service Wix brought in Karlie Kloss for their slot.The commercial shows the model updating her website with new photos while connecting to the likes of Google to make sure her site can be found by browsers.WASHINGTON POST Despite researching showing the Super Bowl viewers feel the game is a bad place to make a political point, the Washington Post went in hard with their ad, entitled \u0027knowing keeps us free\u0027.Narrated by Tom Hanks, it recaps moments in American history that were encapsulated by news coverage, before recapping three prominent journalists killed while reporting - including the Post\u0027s own Jamal Khashoggi.It ends with the mantra: \u0027Knowing empowers us. Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.\u0027AVOCADOS FROM MEXICO One of the more bizarre adverts to grace screens on Sunday night - it featured humans competing in a dog show for a prize of avocados.A contestant was showing rolling over - his 401k - while another woman ended up wearing a cone of shame after breaking ranks and running towards a table covered in guacamole.VERIZON Verizon chose to honor first responders in its Super Bowl advert, which also featured LA Chargers coach Anthony Lynn.Lynn recounts how he was badly injured in a 2005 car crash to a group of emergency workers, saying: \u0027I promise you I wouldn\u0027t be here today if it wasn\u0027t for the first responders.\u0027Then, in a tear-jerker moment, members of the crowd step forward to reveal they helped to save his life.T-MOBILE T-Mobile spent big on the Super Bowl, airing one advert per quarter, though none of them were especially memorable.Instead, the network used the expensive slots to announce a series of giveaways for customers, including free Lyft rides and free Taco Bell.AVENGERS: ENDGAMEMarvel Studios debuted a new 60-second trailer for the highly-anticipated Avengers: Endgame during the Super Bowl LIII telecast.The highly-anticipated superhero adventure will bring Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to a close, and is set in the aftermath of the devastating events of 2018\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War.COLGATE Luke Wilson made a celebrity cameo for this advert where he plays a \u0027close talker\u0027 - harkening back to an old Seinfeld episode.Wilson is firmly of the opinion that - thanks to Colgate\u0027s cleaning power - there is no such thing as talking \u0027too close\u0027 to somebody.\u0027Yes, there is,\u0027 an irritated mail man informs him.CAPTAIN MARVEL Marvel Studios debuted a new 30-second trailer for Captain Marvel during Super Bowl LIII, which showcases how this movie will take the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u0027higher, further, faster.\u0027Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, an Air Force pilot who, after a mysterious explosion with Kree technology, is imbued with incredible powers, which are on full display in the new trailer.WONDER PARKParamount\u0027s all-star animated film - based on a theme park ride - makes its pitch for Easter family movie in this trailer.Featuring the vocal talents of Kenan Thompson, Jennifer Garner, Mila Kunis, Matthew Broderick and John Oliver, it imagines what would happen if a child\u0027s dream theme park became a reality.WALMARTWalmart relied on an entirely different kind of star power for its ad, which featured famous vehicles instead of famous faces.Transformer\u0027s Bumblebee, Back to the Future\u0027s Delorean, and Ecto-1 from the original Ghostbusters are among a dozen vehicles to feature in the spot.RAM  Having been blasted for using a Martin Luther King speech to sell trucks back in 2018, this year sees RAM in a pensive mood - reflecting on the adverts of yesteryear.Two cowboys packing up their harnesses discuss what happened in all of the ads, though neither of them can remember what product they were selling.\u0027They just need to show you what they\u0027re selling,\u0027 one of them says, before climbing into his truck and starting the engine. MERCEDESAnother brand to air two spots during the game, Mercedes\u0027 first featured Ludacris who went to the Ron Clark Academy to surprise students.The surprises didn\u0027t stop there, however, as he handed out two tickets to the Super Bowl to two lucky pupils.The car brand\u0027s second slot features a man bending the world to his will using only the power of his voice - from finding cats to rescuing people trapped in an elevator, and giving away thousands of dollars.\u0027If only everything listened to you like a new A-Class,\u0027 the ad finishes.AMAZON PRIME - HANNAOriginally an oddball thriller film by Atonement director Joe Wright and starring Cate Blanchett, Amazon has taken the concept and turned it into a series.Fan will be able to watch the first episode online for 24 hours after the game ends. TOYOTA The car maker sets out to \u0027shatter perceptions\u0027 in this ad, featuring Toni Harris - the woman who wants to become the first to play in the NFL.Recapping Harris\u0027s incredible journey, including all the things she was told she could never be, Toyota says it has \u0027never been a fan of perceptions\u0027 before introducing its new RAV-4 Hybrid.HOBBS AND SHAW The latest trailer for the Fast and Furious spin-off which will feature Dwayne \u0027The Rock\u0027 Johnson and Jason Statham reprising their roles as lawman Luke Hobbs and lawless outcast Deckard Shaw. The pair face off against \u0027bad guy\u0027 Brixton - played by Idris Elba - who has gained control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever.It is left to Hattie Shaw - Deckard\u0027s sister, played by Vanessa Kirby - to bring ther brother and his sworn enemy together to bring down Brixton. NETFLIX - OUR PLANET Having dominated the true crime market with  Making A Murderer, the streaming giant\u0027s latest foray into the world of documentaries sees them turn to nature.This looks set to be another winner, since Netflix has teamed up with veteran documentary-maker David Attenborough for the series.KIA When you cannot be known for who you are, you must make yourself know for what you do - at least according to the car company\u0027s Super Bowl advert.Honoring the \u0027great unknowns\u0027 in America, it uses its small-brand name to its advantage in this touching ad, which stands up alongside the likes of Mercedes and Toyota, who also aired commercials during the game.YELLOW TAIL Panned as one of the game\u0027s most boring adverts, the Yellow Tail spot featured fan-made videos which fit with its slogan \u0027tastes like happy\u0027.Explaining what he likes about the ad, Adrien Colon - director of a San Francisco-based marketing platform who features in the commercial in a bahama hat - said: \u0027The mood is right, and the tone is right. \u0027It\u0027s mixed with different emotions, and moments where I chuckle and smile. It\u0027s about joy, and we can all relate.\u0027DEVOUR FROZEN FOODS Created by the same ad firm behind the Budweiser and Burger King ads, this one features a couple suffering through the effects of \u0027food porn\u0027 addiction.While the man gets his fix of frozen foods however and whenever he can, his partner tries and fails to tempt him away with home-made delights - to no avail.Some found it funny, others found it gross - but the \u0027dirty\u0027 version is currently the second-most-watched of any Super Bowl commercial online, after Budweiser.AUDIA bizarre advert featuring a dream-scape in which a man is given Audi\u0027s new electric car by his presumably deceased grandfather, this had a lot of viewers scratching their heads.Of course, it turns out the vision is not real and conjured up as a man chokes on a cashew, before he is \u0027saved\u0027 by a co-worker and plunges back into reality.The car, however, is real - as is the fact that Audi is going electric, with a third of all models to be electric powered by 2025.SKITTLESAnother of the Super Bowl\u0027s odder moments saw Skittles create not just an advert, but a full-blown 30 minute musical - part of which aired during the game.Starring Dexter’s Michael C Hall, it shows him changing his mind about creating a musical after eating Skittles gives him the confidence to press ahead with the idea.BON \u0026amp VIV SELTZERFeaturing two mermaids named Bon and Viv, who inform the viewer about their seltzer spiked with alcohol, assuring them that \u0027the myth is real\u0027.In fact, the pair are actually talking to a row of literal sharks - referencing the show Shark Tank - which is revealed as the camera pans back.The predators then begin arguing over who\u0027s buying the product as the ad ends. "},{"url":null,"title":"The booming sales snakeskin items","story":"    Last month, Stephanie Scolaro was sentenced to 160 hours community service for illegally importing £17,000 worth of pink and gold python skin baseball capsBecause pythons have such low metabolic rates — their heartbeat can be as slow as 12 beats per minute — they live on and on, after being bludgeoned, inflated and skinned. Once in this state, it can take a couple of days of excruciating pain before they die of shock or dehydration.What possible reason could there be to make the world\u0027s longest snakes suffer in such a gruesome manner?The fashion industry, of course! Namely, expensive, high-end, exotic-skins fashion — python bags, belts, shoes, boots, trainers, wallets, purses, credit card holders, baseball caps, you name it.Little thought is given to the pythons, still writhing in pain for up to 48 hours. The only thing that matters are the reticulated python\u0027s supple skin and diamond patterns, which are lovingly cleaned, carefully coiled and dried, before being sold for as little as £3 per kilo.          She sold the caps (pictured) for £450 a pop through her own website and  a Mayfair boutique and a menswear shop in Bexleyheath, KentLast month, Stephanie Scolaro, 26, an heiress and part-time swimwear model who couldn\u0027t possibly have needed the money, was sentenced to 160 hours community service for illegally importing £17,000 worth of pink and gold python skin baseball caps.She sold them for £450 a pop through her own website and via a Mayfair boutique and a menswear shop in Bexleyheath, Kent.Grieving mother tells how son, 15, hanged himself after...A VERY distinctive mugshot! Man, 20, with blond hair, a red...Share this articleAfter her various court appearances, she pouted and scowled, stuck two immaculately manicured middle fingers up at the media and claimed she had been duped — that, unbeknown to her, the damning paperwork had been forged.She insisted that she had no idea that any snakes had suffered, that she was an animal-lover who would never hurt a flea, far less skin it alive and turn it into an unnecessary fashion accessory. Had she known, she claimed, they were illegal, she would never have imported them.Noble words, perhaps, and ones that probably reflect most people\u0027s views.          Reticulated pythons are being slaughtered by the thousands deep in the Indonesian jungle (Pictured, a python hangs in a workshop for skinning snakes in Cirebon, Indonesia)           The snakes are smashed on the head with a mallet — not hard enough to kill them, just to stun them  (Pictured, a worker slices along the backbone to remove the skin)For while most of us consider using real fur for clothes as a massive ethical faux pas (and, in response, most fashion houses have turned to artificial substitutes), less attention is given to exotic skins.\u0027Snakes aren\u0027t cute and cuddly in the same way foxes and rabbits are,\u0027 says Yvonne Taylor, of the animal rights group PETA. \u0027But just like mammals, they are sensitive to pain and suffering.\u0027Yet the traffic in exotic animals for flesh and skins is the third largest — after weapons and drugs — in the world. Every year, about 500,000 python skins are imported from South-East Asia to Europe legally, complete with the correct paperwork from CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which aims to protect specific species from extinction by regulating their trade).Often they are sent to tanneries in Italy where the skin is chemically treated so it can be turned into designer accessories.In addition to the legal trade, skins worth £600 million are imported illegally into Europe every year, often via Singapore.           Supermodel Kate Moss, pictured at a Gucci party in 2014, popularised the snakeskin pattern in fashionThese may have dodgy CITES paperwork — as Scolaro\u0027s allegedly had — or no paperwork, and are invariably wild snakes that have been hunted down by locals and \u0027laundered\u0027 through snake farms who sell them for vast sums.In the wild and left to its own devices, a Burmese python will cover a territory of eight square miles and can expect to live for up to 30 years.On a farm, a reticulated python — which can grow to about 30ft and weigh up to 20st — can barely uncoil and is lucky if it makes it past six months.According to Clifford Warwick, a biologist and former snake farm investigator, many are kept in a \u0027racking system in what look like haberdashery drawers in a vast warehouse\u0027.He adds: \u0027Each tiny drawer contains one snake and the only natural light comes from a tiny opaque window at the front.\u0027When they grow out of this, they are transferred into wire crates, with hundreds of other snakes and, if they live long enough, to an inidual large crate.The fact is that snakes wither in captivity. They are prone to parasites, bacterial infections, problems with their immune systems and stress.\u0027Snakes in cages show up to 30 different types of stress,\u0027 says Mr Warwick.They are fed on rats, mice and bits of chicken, but grow slowly — about 10ft in three years, which is far too long a time for most snake farmers\u0027 balance sheets.So they pay locals to hunt wild reticulated pythons — which are easy to catch with the help of a stick, a mallet and a hessian sack — and drop them off by the sack-load to be slaughtered.Last week, Yuda Mukti, 39, a snake catcher from Kertasura Village in the Kapetakan District of Java, Indonesia, boasted that in the height of the rainy season — the optimum snake-hunting conditions — he can collect a ton of snakes in just three days.He passes them on to a processing plant or \u0027farm\u0027 where they are either inflated with compressed air or water.According to Mr Warwick, these farms are largely a front used to hide the fact that most pythons have been illegally hunted.\u0027Though they always try to disguise them, if you look closely at a designer handbag or a boot you often see blemishes, little scars — scrapes and nicks they picked up in the wild,\u0027 he says.          A worker at a workshop for skinning snakes handles a live snake brought in by a snake hunter in Cirebon, IndonesiaWith today\u0027s obsession in the West with veganism, vegetarianism, ethical food production and sustainable fashion, one might wonder who on earth would want to buy \u0027luxury snakeskin accessories\u0027? As PETA\u0027s Yvonne Taylor puts it: \u0027We\u0027re already moving from what\u0027s in your fridge to what\u0027s in your wardrobe.\u0027Most millennials, however rich, wouldn\u0027t be seen dead with a python bag on their arm.Particularly when there\u0027s now such a booming market for fake snake accessories made from embossed eco-friendly fabrics that are coloured to replicate the most beautiful pythons.Indeed, some fashion houses have now stopped using exotic skins.In December, Chanel, which previously sold handbags, coats and shoes made from snake, alligator and stingray skins, announced it would not use exotic animal pelts in future collections.Flamboyant designer Vivienne Westwood has vowed to steer clear of exotic skins. Diane Von Furstenberg has followed suit.However, Paris-based Kering, the company behind brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, is heading fast in the other direction.In 2017, and to great fanfare, the company opened its own python farm in Thailand.Bosses promised that the snakes would be raised in \u0027the best conditions for animals, farmers and the eco system\u0027 before they are turned into shoes, bags and belts.Kering said it was aiming to provide a sustainable source of skins and made much of its CITES certification.          Every year, about 500,000 python skins are imported from South-East Asia to Europe legally, complete with the correct paperwork (Pictured, a factory in Pekalongan)Which all sounds fine, of course, until you remember that Kering has invested its money not out of the goodness of its heart or a desire to protect these animals, but because of a vested interest in keeping the python and exotic skins trade going.According to Clifford Warwick, there is no evidence that the conditions or slaughter methods used by these farms — in this case thought to be drowning in a crate — are much better.\u0027Pythons are not humanely raised and they\u0027re not humanely killed,\u0027 he says.\u0027It\u0027s all about protecting the skin, not the animal\u0027s welfare.\u0027He says that the only 100 per cent humane way is giving the snake a sedative followed by a lethal injection.But while this is a cheap method and would protect the snake\u0027s precious skin, it would render the snake meat unusable and bosses worry about the unsupervised use of toxic chemicals on their farms.Meanwhile, back in Indonesia, the impact of the python trade ripples out. Removing hundreds of thousands of predators from the wild upsets the food chain.Rats are their main prey — a python eats a dozen a month — and local explosions in the rat population result in plague epidemics and cause parasites to ravage rice fields — the staple local crop.Even the hunters are exploited. They spend night after night combing through jungles and swamps to track down their quarry only to be paid pennies for something that will eventually sell for thousands of pounds and find its way onto the arm, back, head, waist or feet of someone who really should know better.Or, just maybe, it won\u0027t.Because hopefully, anyone tempted to splash out on a python skin product, however beautiful the diamond pattern, however exquisite the workmanship, however festooned it is in CITES certifications, will remember the images of Stephanie Scolaro\u0027s utterly tasteless £450 baseball caps.And, hopefully, they will bring to mind Yvonne Taylor\u0027s salutary words: \u0027There is no such thing as an exotic ethical skin.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Ancient artefacts Iraq returned home Jordanian officials 1 300 piece stash","story":"    Antiquities recovered from Jordan are displayed at the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad          Iraqi Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Abdulameerr al-Hamadani, gives a press conference at the Iraq National Museum          An Assyrian artifact is displayed at the Iraq National Museum. Iraqi Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Abdulameer al-Hamadani said the recovery of 1,300 pieces of antiquities that Jordanian authorities confiscated from smugglers is a \u0027milestone\u0027Al-Hamadani is now asking the international community to support Iraq in its quest to recover its antiquities.The return of the artefacts came as Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and his Jordanian counterpart Omar Razzaz revealed a new, united front.On Saturday the border crossing between the two nations was officially reopened after a deal signed between them which includes boosted trade.From now, Iraq will supply Jordan with 10,000 barrels of oil a day at a lower price.Iraqi goods imported via Jordan\u0027s Aqaba port would also receive preferential tariffs, the Jordanian prime minister\u0027s office said while Jordan would begin to export electricity to Iraq within the next two years.AirBnB invasion: Hundreds of drug-fuelled partygoers take...BBC Question Time host Fiona Bruce attempts to end the...Revealed: Surgeon jailed for £180,000 burglary scam was...Share this article    Iraqi Antiquities are on dispaly during a press conference held by the Iraqi Minister of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities          Abdulameer al-Hamadani called on the international community to support Iraq in its quest to recover its antiquities          The hundreds of ancient pieces which included huge stone statues were returned home           The Assyrian artefacts were stolen from the country but were returned under a great fanfare  "},{"url":null,"title":"Britains richest man Jim Ratcliffe blasts Vivienne Westwood icons opposition fracking","story":"    Britain\u0027s richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe (above) has launched a blistering attack on Dame Vivienne Westwood  over her opposition to frackingBritain\u0027s richest man has launched a blistering attack on Dame Vivienne Westwood over her opposition to fracking.Chemicals tycoon Sir Jim Ratcliffe – who is worth £21billion – said the designer did not care about the jobs it would create, and accused her of living in a London bubble.Dame Vivienne, 77, hit back, calling Sir Jim, 66, a liar bent on destroying the environment.His firm, Ineos, is a key player in the dash for shale gas.

Questions have persisted about whether Gronkowski might call it quits on a grueling career that has included significant injuries and multiple surgeries.\u0027It\u0027s really not about that tonight, it\u0027s about celebrating with my team tonight,\u0027 Gronkowski said in a postgame interview with NFL Network. \u0027I\u0027m going to take a few weeks, a week or two, see where I\u0027m at, make a decision from there. But tonight it\u0027s about celebrating with the team, celebrating with everyone. We were grinding, what, seven months since training camp, putting the work on. It paid off, and now it\u0027s time to celebrate.\u0027Gronkowski hauled in six catches for 87 yards in the Patriots\u0027 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams. His 29-yard catch in the fourth quarter helped to set up Sony Michel\u0027s 2-yard rushing touchdown, which put New England ahead for good.The nine-year veteran tight end credited Tom Brady with putting the ball in a perfect spot.\u0027On that play, we saw that there was a matchup right there,\u0027 Gronkowski said. \u0027There was a linebacker on me, and that\u0027s when I knew the ball was going to come to me. I knew Tom was going to throw it up there and (I could) just run up and make the play. It was a crucial play, and Sony just did the job finishing it off with a touchdown, which was awesome.\u0027Gronkowski was willing to clarify one question about his future: Yes, he planned to party Sunday night and beyond.\u0027Bill (Belichick) said he\u0027s partying tonight, and I ain\u0027t going to let him out-party me,\u0027 Gronkowski said with a grin.

They routinely sent an extra deep safety on third-and-short situations and disguised their blitzes up the middle. The latter benefited linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower, who dropped Goff for a pair of sacks to stunt drives.New England finished with four sacks for the game.\u0027We\u0027re a relentless team,\u0027 linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower said. \u0027We didn\u0027t give up. A lot was thrown at us. When we play like we did tonight, we can\u0027t be beat.\u0027 It added up to an abysmal performance by Los Angeles on third-down situations. The Rams were 0 for 6 on third down in the first half and 3 of 13 for game. New England also held Los Angeles to just 260 total yards. The Patriots defense deserves much of the credit for the close score after holding the Rams to just 78 first-half yards.The first half was certainly a departure from the regular season, when the Rams and Patriots ranked second and fifth, respectively, in offensive yards. On Sunday the two teams combined for nine punts on the first ten drives of the game. In fact, the Rams had never gone scoreless in a first half under coach Sean McVay until Sunday against the Patriots. Los Angeles actually entered halftime with only 78 yards, compared to 195 for New England.  Edelman had 93 receiving yards in the first half, outgaining the Rams\u0027 offense by himself. The six combined points were the fewest scored by two teams through the first three quarters of Super Bowl history.           Tom Brady was intercepted on the Patriots\u0027 opening drive in Super Bowl LIII           View of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium prior to the Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta on Sunday The Rams appeared to be driving for a touchdown in the third quarter, when Patriots linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower\u0027s sack of  Goff left Greg Zuerlein with a 53-yard field goal attempt, which he converted to tie the game.  Brady\u0027s pick was nearly caught by Patriots receiver Chris Hogan at the Rams\u0027 27-yard line, but the ball deflected into the waiting hands of Los Angeles linebacker Cory Littleton. The Patriots took a 3-0 lead in into halftime thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski in the second quarter. He previously missed a 46-yard attempt in the first quarter, which was the first missed kick by any NFL kicker this season in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons.            Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on February 3, 2019 in Atlanta, GeorgiaThe Patriots registered five first downs in the first quarter compared to just one for the Rams, but Brady and New England\u0027s offense still failed to score a point despite driving into Los Angeles territory on their first three possessions.   Brady also has a fumble in the first quarter, which was recovered by the Patriots. Besides Patriots fans, New Orleans Saints supporters also celebrated the outcome of Super Bowl LIII. The Saints seemed destined to beat the Rams in the NFC title game before a blown call ultimately led to Los Angeles\u0027 come-from-behind win.   With the teams tied 20-20 late in regulation, officials failed to call pass interference or helmet-to-helmet penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman for knocking Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis down as he awaited a pass.

(stock image)Hard shoulders are dangerous enough places, but they are havens of security compared to the feeling of sitting motionless on an active motorway lane with a car full of loved ones, while in your rear-view mirror you see a juggernaut approaching at speed.There was no way we could have all got out in time. We just had to pray the lorry driver was concentrating, otherwise we would have been pulverised.Mercifully, I saw his indicator lights come on and the lorry pulled out.

I could list more examples, but what should be abundantly clear is that breaking down in an active motorway lane is incredibly dangerous.And because of the fatalities and near-misses, more and more people are questioning the wisdom of these supposedly ‘smart’ motorways.Among them is Tracey Crouch, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford, who is part of an all-party group of MPs which is backing campaigners who maintain that the absence of a hard shoulder puts motorists and recovery workers at risk.          Ellie Montgomery ended up in a neck brace after her broken-down car was slammed into by a lorry travelling at 50 to 60 mph on a ‘smart’ stretch of the M6Ms Crouch wants a halt to the introduction of smart motorways without hard shoulders.‘We need the Government to pause and reflect on whether we’re getting this right … until we have a better understanding about how we can protect those who have broken down and the recovery workers that come to assist them,’ she said in a recent interview.Ms Crouch is not the only respected voice who has such misgivings. Joining her is Dave Blundell of the Police Federation, who said last week that such motorways are making it hard for police patrols to do their jobs properly.Smart motorways are ‘difficult for the police to operate on’, he said. ‘There’s no hard shoulder, so where do we safely stop another motorist if they have committed an offence or we want to give them some advice?’‘The answer is that we can’t. We have to wait miles and miles and miles until there is a hard shoulder and we are able to do that. There are lots of questions that need to be asked.’Indeed there are. And here are just a few for starters.What exactly is a smart motorway? What are they for? What do they cost? How many miles of smart motorway are there? Are they not just revenue-raisers? And finally, just how smart are they?There are essentially three different types of ‘smart’ motorway, but what is common to all is that they have variable speed limits, indicated by overhead gantries. According to the Highways Agency, having variable speed limits helps traffic flow more smoothly, thereby enabling quicker journey times.The differences between the three types of smart motorway revolves around the hard shoulder.On a ‘controlled motorway’, there are three or more lanes and a permanent hard shoulder — just as there is on a normal motorway.Meanwhile, on a ‘dynamic hard shoulder’ motorway, the hard shoulder is semi-permanent and used as a lane during busy times of the day.Finally, there is the ‘all lane running’ option, in which there is no hard shoulder at all. Instead, there are occasional ‘refuge areas’. In total, there are some 100 miles of ‘all lane running’ smart motorway — known as ALR for short — and a further 225 miles are planned by 2025.Overall costs are hard to establish, but the most reliable estimates run to about £6 billion spent so far, with the final estimated total being £20 billion, perhaps more.And what are we getting for our money? Well, we get lots of people in control rooms all over the country watching the traffic and then deciding whether to activate the variable speed limits or to ‘turn’ the hard shoulder on or off. But is this making the traffic run more quickly, and — vitally — more safely? According to the Highways Agency, it does.          Tracey Crouch is part of an all-party group of MPs  backing campaigners who maintain that the absence of a hard shoulder puts motorists and recovery workers at riskJourney ‘reliability’, it is claimed, is improved by 22 per cent, personal injury accidents are reduced by more than half, and where accidents do occur, severity has been much lower overall.Furthermore, as the Agency estimates that congestion on the motorway and major road network in England costs the UK economy £2 billion every year, with 25 per cent of this resulting from various incidents, the smart motorways could end up saving more money than they cost.Impressive, yes. But what these figures don’t factor in are the absurd number of delays and the huge congestion caused by converting normal motorways into ‘smart motorways’.As someone who regularly uses the M3, I am well aware of how many hours I’ve wasted in traffic jams caused by years and years of roadworks that appear to have done very little apart from turn a hard shoulder into an extra lane.In addition, like many other motorists, I’m not convinced that the variable speed limits improve my journey times. Too often there is no apparent logic to their use. Frequently, I find myself being told to crawl along a near-empty motorway at 40 mph.According to campaigners, this is what happens when controllers are slaves to computer modelling and algorithms, rather than allowing the common sense of most drivers to find their own appropriate speeds.Of course, the temptation to break an unnecessary speed limit is immense, and herein lies another problem: I can get fined for travelling at 45 mph on a nearly empty motorway.This has prompted critics to question whether smart motorways are, in fact, just another cunning form of revenue-raiser rather than genuine traffic management solutions.In the four years from 2013 to 2017, 210,538 motorists were caught by cameras enforcing variable speed limits on smart motorways, and fined a total of £21 million.Although that figure is a drop in the ocean of the billions spent on smart motorways, being fined for travelling below the normal motorway speed limit because an algorithm orders you to do so must really stick in the craw.Finally, do smart motorways really make traffic run faster overall? Some think not. One 16-mile ‘smart’ ALR section of the M25, for example, recorded journey times that were, in fact, eight per cent longer during peak periods than before.And there is a dearth of statistics to support the notion that journeys on smart motorways are any quicker being, merely just 22 per cent more ‘reliable’, whatever that means.There are some who argue that motorways will not truly be smart until roads are embedded with wi-fi-enabled sensors and cables that can communicate with cars and control centres, and immediately warn drivers directly or via gantries if there has been an accident, tailbacks or other incidents, and alert them to lane closures via ‘glow-in-the dark’ road markings.Vehicle-to-vehicle communication, in which all our — possibly driverless — cars effectively ‘talk’ to each other is another way in which our roads could be made a lot more smart, as vehicles will be able to warn those travelling far behind that there has been a problem.But while some countries — the U.S. and the Netherlands — are already introducing some of these innovations, they remain decades away and will doubtless be cripplingly expensive and involve more disruption and tailbacks in order to install them.Highways England are, of course, defensive of their smart motorways and claim they’re performing better than conventional ones.‘Evidence proves they are as safe as traditional motorways, which are already among the safest roads in the world,’ a Highways England spokesman said yesterday.I am not convinced. With fears about safety and doubts about supposed improvements, it really does look as though the roll-out of smart motorways should be stopped.Smart motorways, it seems, are actually just a bit thick."},{"url":null,"title":"Maroon 5 takes stage perform half time Super Bowl LIII","story":"     Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during halftime of the NFL Super Bowl 53 football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots          A shirtless Adam Levine ended the show with Maroon 5\u0027s hit Moves Like Jagger           Levine took off his tank top as he finished off the performance with a bang  Adam showed off his tattooed torso          Adam seemed to be in impressive shape          Adam and crew ended their performance with Moves Like JaggerImmediately following the performance, Levine took to Instagram to post a photo of the message with a lengthy caption: \u0027When we accepted the responsibility to perform at the SBHTS, I took out my pen and just wrote.

I\u0027m sure they will have the right professionals out there for that.\u0027The specialist search for the missing plane began off the coast of Guernsey yesterday morning and located the wreckage on the seabed just hours later.Sala and pilot Ibbotson left Nantes in France for Cardiff on January 21 -  after the star signed for the Welsh Premier League team, disappearing over the Channel.           The specialist FPV Morven ship, pictured in Guernsey, was being used in a privately funded search for the plane of missing footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson          The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) Geo Ocean III moved in to assist the Morven when it discovered wreckage. Geo sent an ROV to visually identify the wreck on the seabed The official search was called off after four days but Sala\u0027s friends, family and fans clubbed together to pay for a private search to continue with renowned shipwreck hunter Mr Mearns.On Sunday morning, their efforts paid off.  Geo Ocean III left Ostend in Belgium at 9am and began combing the area. Within hours it was search vessel FPV Morven which picked up a sonar signal from the depths.The wreckage of the Piper Malibu was formally identified by officials from the Air Accident Investigation Board.The AAIB\u0027s vessel deployed a remote-controlled submarine to examine the plane and tonight confirmed it was the craft carrying the striker.Families of both men have been informed of the discovery. Sala\u0027s father said last night he had not had any contact with the rest of his family - who are still in a hotel in Nantes - and found out about the plane\u0027s discovery on TV.\u0027I communicated with them every day, but since I do not have Whatsapp it\u0027s hard to call them or call me. They told me that the days passed and there was no news of Emiliano or the plane,\u0027 said Horacio. He said that the family are in the hotel along with \u0027eight or nine\u0027 friends who are believed to have received the news from Argentine embassies in France and England, at 9am. Both the AAIB\u0027s Geo Ocean III vessel and a private boat, which includes a side-scan sonar, were used to try and find the aircraft. Teams from the AAIB have now moved into location at the site to recover the aircraft. The vessel that made the discovery was lead by marine scientist David Mearns, who confirmed the identity and location of the plane. He confirmed that it was in the early stages of this morning\u0027s search, around 9am,  the discovery was made. \u0027But tonight they have heard devastating news and in respect of the families I won\u0027t comment any further about what has happened.\u0027The recovery vessel picked up something on the sonar 24 miles off Guernsey and made further passes over the area to pinpoint the location before going through various stages of identification. David Mearns called the news \u0027devastating\u0027 but told Sky News that \u0027at least we were able to bring some sort of answer to the families.\u0027              A track of the FPV Morven shows it returning to shore after the wreckage was discovered           Mr Mearns told Sky News: \u0027This is about the best result we could have hoped for the families\u0027The discovery came just two days after cushions from a plane were found on a beach near Surtainville in Normandy, France, directly east of Guernsey where the plane disappeared from radar. Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson disappeared when their plane vanished as it passed near Alderney on 21 January during a flight from Nantes to Cardiff.The AAIB said its search was expected to last three days, while the private search will continue \u0027until the plane is located\u0027, reported the BBC.Wreckage of Emiliano Sala\u0027s plane is found by shipwreck crew21 Savage\u0027s mum can be heard speaking with an English accentInterview with David Mearns who found Emiliano Sala\u0027s missing planeMan in critical health conditions says he was denied benefitsParents make heartbreaking plea to find their daughter LibbyDuncan Bannatyne celebrates birthday with wife Nigora in BarbadosBarry Gardiner pleads with Labour MPs to pass May\u0027s Brexit dealHilary Benn: \u0027I don\u0027t see how it can work in the short time left\u0027Underwater search for Emiliano Sala\u0027s plane gets underwayFisherman uses a dead shark as a bong to the tune of Baby SharkMP reacts to Nissan moving X-Trail production in JapanA four mile square area, based on the flight path before the plane lost contact, was covered. The official search after the plane\u0027s disappearance was called off after three days as officials didn\u0027t believe there was much chance of anyone having survived. An online petition was then started which raised more than £300,000 to put on a privately-funded search using a specialist survey vessel. Cardiff City players wear t-shirts with Emiliano Sala\u0027s face...Marine scientist behind the hunt for Emiliano Sala\u0027s \u0027badly...Share this articleMore than 3,500 people had responded to the appeal for funds and the target was broken with the help of a £26,000 donation from French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe.  The boat, operated by global marine cable installation firm A-2-Sea, is equipped with the latest technology.It includes a multi-beam echosounder and side-scan sonar, which can detect anomalies on the seabed.

I\u0027ve been told they can either travel over and see me or I have got to keep in touch via Skype\u0027Speaking from the detention centre where he is being held, Mr Haisley said: \u0027I hold my hands up, I have made mistakes but I have gone to prison, done my time for it, done rehabilitation and restorative justice, and they say I can\u0027t have a second chance.\u0027Why do I have to be sent to another country and bring my children up on Skype? \u0027Offenders with a British passport can repeatedly offend and be given another chance. I\u0027m not a repeat offender.\u0027 After spending time in London as a child, Mr Haisley moved to Manchester 30 years ago to live with his great aunt, who is part of the Windrush generation. He gained popularity as a drum and bass and jungle DJ and MC and enjoyed residences at city centre nightclubs.He then spent 12 years teaching music workshops to young people as part of the organisation Greater Manchester Music Action Zone and most recently worked as a mobile phone executive.He has worked legally with the National Insurance number he was given when he was 16 and paid taxes. Mr Haisley holds a Jamaican passport but says he feels \u0027more Mancunian than Jamaican\u0027. He said he never thought to apply for a British passport because he had lived and worked in the country for so long without a problem - a decision he now regrets. After various appeals to the Home Office over the last three years he was detained and was due to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica last April, days after the Windrush scandal broke.But the flight was cancelled for reasons the Home Office did not disclose.        Ryanair blames \u0027weaker than expected air fares\u0027 as it...Debt-ridden British soldier who turned to drink and drugs...Share this article\u0027Anyone of interest to the Jamaican police will be held and everyone else will be let go.\u0027 He says he is worried about returning to a country he hasn\u0027t set foot in since he was a young child with no family or friends to lean on.\u0027My children need me,\u0027 he added. \u0027I\u0027ve been told they can either travel over and see me or I have got to keep in touch via Skype.\u0027The Home Office say because of my criminality they want to deport me. I just wanna be given a second chance like everyone else that does a crime and serves time.\u0027I came over here legally.

He is pictured in a court sketch of a previous hearingThe Hatton Garden suspect known as \u0027Basil\u0027 teamed up with a gang of elderly crooks to raid jewels, gold ingots and cash in the biggest burglary ever pulled off.Michael Seed, 58, is accused of involvement in the infamous raid carried out in London\u0027s diamond district over Easter weekend in 2015.He was also allegedly involved in a \u0027strikingly similar\u0027 £1m burglary on Amal Clooney\u0027s wedding jewellers, Chatila, in Mayfair during the August Bank Holiday weekend of 2010.But Seed remained at large until he was arrested last March.Philip Evans QC, prosecuting, said: \u0027This case involves the alleged involvement of Michael John Seed in two high value burglaries, one in 2015 and one in 2010.\u0027The 2015 burglary occurred on Easter weekend, between April 2 and April 5, where a group of men carried out a plan to steal a very substantial quantity of gold, jewellery, precious stones, cash and other items from the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company which is situated in the basement of a building in Hatton Garden, the jewellery district of central London.\u0027They then proceeded to launder the proceeds they did that together and with the assistance of others.          He is accused of being part of a gang which raided Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd in 2015The prosecutor continued: \u0027You may already be aware of this burglary – it is believed that it was, at the time, the largest burglary in English legal history, and as consequence partly of that it has been the subject of significant public interest.\u0027That offence was a considerable time in its planning, and the identified perpetrators brought with them a great deal of experience in executing serious acquisitive crime. The total loss figure at Hatton Garden was estimated to be £13.69 million.\u0027Nine people were subsequently convicted of offences arising out of that burglary.Mr Evans added: \u0027But, of the six men who physically entered the premises at Hatton Garden, one of them was not arrested with the others and he remained at large.Rapper goes on trial for killing Holby City actor\u0027s daughter...Share this article\u0027This man was referred to by the co-conspirators as \u0027Basil\u0027. It is the prosecution case is that \u0027Basil\u0027 was a nickname and the defendant, Michael Seed, is that man.\u0027The prosecution say Seed was involved in the burglary of Hatton Garden and that he was involved in the subsequent laundering of that burglary.\u0027The investigation into some of those men who committed the crime at Hatton Garden revealed that they had also committed a previous, and strikingly similar, burglary on the Bank Holiday weekend of 28 to 31 August back in 2010.\u0027The burglary was of a jewellery store named \u0027Chatila\u0027 which is located in Bond Street, London, during the course of that burglary a group of men broke into display cabinets in the main showroom and stole a large quantity of high value jewellery and precious stones, worth a total of approximately $1.3m (£1m), along with £45,000 in cash.          Hatton Garden burglars Daniel Jones and Terry Perkins were both allegedly also involved in the 2010 raid on Chatila, the court heard todayMr Evans QC continued: \u0027One of the men involved in the offence at Hatton Garden, Daniel Jones, pleaded guilty on 16 February 2017 to his part in that earlier 2010 offence at Chatila.\u0027Terence Perkins, another man involved in Hatton Garden, died in prison before he could be tried for the 2010 offence at Chatila.\u0027A final man, Charles Matthews, a man who was an associate of Perkins, was convicted earlier this year for knowingly receiving a portion of the stolen goods from the burglary of Chatila.\u0027And so the prosecution further allege that this defendant, Mr Seed, was also a participant in that earlier 2010 burglary at Chatila.\u0027 Earlier trials have seen the convictions of Danny Jones, 61, Terry Perkins, John Kenneth Collins, 78, \u0027Kenny\u0027, Carl Wood, 58, and Brian Reader, 79, in connection with the Hatton Garden job.          Seed is also accused if playing a part in a 2010 raid on Chatila in Bond Street, MayfairPerkins, 69, died in prison ahead of trial for his alleged involvement in the Chatila raid and Jones admitted his role in the Chatila raid last year.William Lincoln, 63, Hugh Doyle, 51, Terri Robinson, 37, and Bren Walters, 45, were also convicted for conspiring to conceal criminal property.Charles Matthews, 55, was convicted of handling stolen goods.           Chatila made the jewelry for Amal Clooney\u0027s wedding to filmstar husband GeorgeEarlier today, a panel of 12 men and women from a pool of 25 are being selected at Woolwich Crown Court today to try Seed.They were given a list questions from lawyers asking them whether they recognised a list of names, and to ignore dramatisations of the raid.Judge Christopher Kinch QC said: \u0027The point is to flush out someone who may have a particular obsession with the reports or indeed someone who has perhaps worked on one of the books or films.\u0027British stars Michael Caine and Ray Winstone played leading roles in \u0027King of Thieves\u0027 which premiered on 14 September last year.The film depicted the 2015 Easter Bank Holiday Weekend heist and was widely advertised on the London Underground ahead of release. Seed, of  Islington, north London, denies two counts of conspiracy to burgle and one count of conspiracy to conceal or disguise criminal property.

The case belonged originally to a beauty consultant named Darlene and contained old jars of cream, powders and brochures. But the thing that piqued Niemi’s interest after she bought it was a receipt from August 1960: Darlene had sold a jar of Liquid Beauty and one Temptress’s Hairspray, both to herself. “It left me with a feeling of a woman’s failed attempt at success,” says Niemi. “I started to picture her alone, being both beauty consultant and customer, and this led me to my fictional version of Darlene and her relationship to herself.”The image here comes towards the end of the visual short story, after the two characters’ stay in an extravagant desert house and before the final image, in which one buries the other under the shadow of a Joshua tree.The macabre series is one of six collected in the Norwegian photographer’s book In Character, each inspired by a different, pre-owned object. The photographer is her own model: she spends months filling a costume shed with the clothes and belongings of each new persona, then attires herself in them and takes the photos, always alone.“Some people like to hike up mountains to feel exhilarated I like to dress up in big wigs and flamboyant costumes,” she says. “My wardrobe is pretty neutral in real life. I have always been drawn to the act of transformation – as a kid, dressing up made me really happy. Now I get to do it for a living.”Occasionally, her characters’ stories take an unexpected turn: here, instead of an elegant blond woman, the car’s rearview mirror shows a beast-like reflection. “Sometimes strange, inexplicable things happen in images, and I am always drawn to them,” says Niemi. “The animal in the mirror is a mystery, like an unintentional shape shifter.”Anja Niemi: In Character (£24.95, Thames \u0026amp Hudson) is published on 7 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1431fe1e745750beba606a5021051efe95f0b08d/0_204_6855_4114/master/6855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dbd20fbbb3be0d1e5f3aa5dc23315de","title":"don mccullin tate retrospective review","story":"Tate Britain, LondonThis retrospective of the veteran photographer’s images of war, poverty and atrocity shines light on the unconscionable. It’s almost overwhelmingHere is the camera that took a bullet instead of its owner. The military helmet and the light meter, passports and compass, all in a vitrine. Here is the American soldier, traumatised, staring back. Here are the villagers, displaced. Here are the living and here are the dead. Here are things I prefer not to describe.There are too many photographs in Don McCullin’s retrospective at Tate Britain. Room after room, on grey wall after grey wall, they keep on coming. These framed, mostly black and white images are a journey through the world and through the photographer’s life. Now 83, McCullin is a man who has seen too much and borne witness to too much. The too many and the too much are part of the point of this engrossing and demanding exhibition.“Yo lo vi” – I saw it – wrote Goya, beside an image of people fleeing before advancing French troops, in one of the prints in his Disasters of War suite of etchings, made around 200 years ago. “And this as well,” he wrote, beside the subsequent image. Goya’s declarations might not always tell the literal truth of what he saw with his own eyes, but no such doubts accompany McCullin’s photographs. He was there, as the Berlin Wall went up, on the streets of Limassol during the Cyprus civil war, in the Bogside and in Stanleyville, Biafra and Vietnam. He was there with the lone gunman, crouching alert on the floor of the wrecked lobby of the Holiday Inn in Beirut. He was there with the corpse of the Congolese man, his brains shot out beside his bicycle.He was also there when the woman, the very picture of a middle-class housewife, smiled back at his camera, as she was bundled away by the police at a Ban the Bomb protest at Aldermaston in the early 1960s. He also saw the homeless men asleep while standing, hands in pockets, heads lowered like horses, in Whitechapel in 1970. Disaster is so often close to home, in squalid rooms in Bradford, on East End doorsteps, in Toxteth and in Wigan.There are so many great and terrible images here. I snatch at fragments – the kid in the Finsbury park youth club, the gawping blokes with their beers in the stripper pub, the big northern woman queuing with a shiny new shovel in her hand, like the latest accessory. Small consolations and momentary pleasures, along with death and starvation, misery and fear, remind us of a different everyday. Fishermen kick a football about on a Scarborough beach, the sky about to open on a moment of sun. The metal mirror of a Somerset dew pond, round as a plate. A knobbly knees contest in Southend-on-Sea. Then we are back, staring at collapsed staircases, like exposed entrails, spilling from a bombed apartment block in Homs, Syria, and with a man dying of Aids in Zimbabwe.In these unrelenting scenes of trespass and tragedy we are left facing our own voyeurism, an increasing inability to process the mounting horrors. McCullin revisits his own work over and over again, as he prints and reprints his images in his darkroom, repeatedly trying to tease the best from his negatives. His returns to these images cannot be entirely healthy. Unless, that is, they inoculate him against their unconscionable power, both as images and as memories. The words “negatives” and “processing” have rarely felt so freighted.Many of McCullin’s photographs demand a long, strong look. Others we might want to swerve away from almost at the moment of recognition, only needing to see them once. They are already fixed in the developing fluid of the subconscious. Many of us of a certain age will have first encountered McCullin’s photographs by chance through the 1960s and 70s, in the Observer, in the Sunday Times Magazine. Many have been stirring around in my head for most of my life, irreducible and unforgettable.McCullin’s images bought the Vietnam war, starvation in Biafra, civil wars, post-colonial and nearer-to-home sectarian conflicts in Derry and Belfast, into our houses and into our heads in a way that television coverage never could.Sometimes McCullin had to walk away. Sometimes I had to walk away from certain images, too. After a few rooms, I had to take a break from the grieving and the corpses, the starving and the terrified. Our hunger for images may be insatiable, but it becomes hard to concentrate and to give each image, taken at who knows what cost, its due.There is a visceral quality to McCullin’s photographs, in their analogue tonalities, the depth of their blacks and greys, the clarities and dimming of their whites, their strong and weak light, their focus, their attendance on the unconscionable. His insistence on black and white seems to lend his photographs an extra veracity, a sullen, stark truthfulness, stripped of any glamour. McCullin did more than record, even though the situations in which he frequently found himself necessitated instantaneous responses, before the mind with its mortal fear and terror, disgust, moral outrage and doubt, empathy, self-justification, self hate, all the qualms, had a chance to kick in. Photography, he has said, chose him. The exhilaration of danger and the sound of gunfire found him, as much as he sought it out over his long career. Conflict was always round the corner for McCullin, even growing up in low-ceilinged rooms and poverty in Finsbury Park. Down the road, a man shepherds a flock to an abattoir through a grim north London dawn.Where the homeless stood around reeking fires of rubbish in Spitalfields market half a century ago, they sleep in corporate doorways now. The wars continue. There is no end to the poverty, nor to the atrocities. Looking away is not an option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79a3c31f85912197679da1b76072b1613a6a3936/0_168_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c79d0b5489bfe9dcc618c015e21f5fa","title":"people of the whale a portrait of traditional hunting in alaska","story":"Photojournalist Kiliii Yuyan documents the Iñupiaq and their successful conservation practices using indigenous knowledgePeople of the Whale is the story of an Iñupiaq whaling crew, living where the vast plain of ice meets the waters of the Arctic Ocean. For the last 2,000 years, the Iñupiaq have stood on the edge of the sea ice, waiting for the migration of bowhead whales.Out on the sea ice, the Iñupiaq wait for the whale. When a whale passes near the edge of the ice, the experienced crew, paddles over Arctic waters in an umiaq, or skinboat, to catch it. The ice hides its dangers – desperate polar bears hunting humans, massive icequakes when sheets of ice collide.Bowhead whaling is a cultural cornerstone of Iñupiaq identity and a primary source of food on Alaska’s North Slope, where the cost of living is nearly three times that of the lower 48 US states.In this part of Alaska, the government allows co-management of wildlife with Native communities.In 1977, the Alaskan Iñupiaq won the right to maintain their traditional hunt of bowhead whales and manage the population. By 2011, the Iñupiaq had quadrupled the population of the bowhead, while hunting them for subsistence. The story of the Iñupiaq is a vision of successful conservation using indigenous knowledge.I spent four years living on the Arctic sea ice with the Iñupiaq, sharing the watch for polar bears and eating fermented walrus. I began to understand the complex Iñupiaq relationship with the whales they hunt.The traditions, the whaling, they bring everyone together.

Blair and Cameron have ruined their reputations “by doing the most stupid thing in politics that anyone could ever do”.Emin added: “Both of these men, who are fine politicians and essentially good people, will be remembered in history for doing the most terrible things to our political system and I don’t understand why they fell for it, I don’t understand why they did it.”“It really aggrieves me to know that I supported both of these men. All I know is that with both of these actions, we are in such a mess.”She said she could not think “of anything more hideous” than Brexit.“It is really insane. If we leave Europe and it turns out OK and we’re happy eating our cabbages and we’re happy living on an island with our island mentality then fine, I’ll go along with that.

The sculpture is called The Mother and is a representation of her own mum.• Tracey Emin, A Fortnight of Tears is at White Cube Bermondsey from 6 February-7 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbf5aecebb234124ec9a58a145afedb2445f4f4/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c45bb79141c96256e2107878f10ae2","title":"a silent act of resistance the hidden tattoo studios of tehran","story":"Tattoo artists are regularly arrested in Iran and sentenced to fines, lashes or imprisonment – yet they are in huge demand among young peopleMohammed’s tattoo studio is hidden in a back room behind a clothes shop in the poorer, southern part of Tehran. Photos of Al Pacino, Che Guevara and the Eiffel Tower adorn the walls. His customers often ask for classic tattoo motifs – a rose, for example, or a predatory animal – but Maori-style tribal patterns are also popular. “Tattooing is my passion,” he says. “I take the risk simply because it’s so beautiful.”He certainly does take a risk. Tattoo artists are regularly arrested in Iran and sentenced to fines, lashes or even imprisonment. While there is no specific law against tattoos and they are not strictly forbidden in Shia Islam, the authorities strongly reject them as a western phenomenon harmful to Iranian values.In some public places, like swimming pools, there are signs warning that tattooed people are not welcome. When criminals are arrested, newspapers invariably publish photos of their body art to convey the message that tattoos and crime go hand in hand. Football players with tattooed arms have been forced to wear long sleeves.Yet body art is immensely popular among young people in Tehran. Among the clientele of the trendy cafes in the city centre are many people with visible tattoos. And everywhere in town you’ll find underground studios like Mohammed’s. Some are located in back rooms behind shops or in beauty parlours where women go for permanent makeup such as eyeliner – the only form of tattooing the authorities allow. Others receive their clients at home. They often have difficulty finding good equipment.Mohammed, who is 27, started 10 years ago with the machine his mother used for permanent makeup. He saw tattoos becoming a craze among young, urban Iranians about seven years ago. “The internet was an important factor. People saw it on social media and decided they wanted it, too,” he says.“My clients say that tattoos make them feel more themselves. They feel more beautiful and stronger. A man feels more powerful when he’s got a dragon tattooed on his back.”Reza Arjmand, a sociologist at the University of Lund in Sweden, has done extensive research into the new tattoo culture in Iran and collected more than 5,000 photos. His book The Subversive Skin: Tattoo in Post-Revolutionary Iran will be published this year.“Tattoos are not new in Iran,” he says. “But it used to be something for the lower classes – men who had been to prison and women in prostitution. The new trend is for hip, young people. It’s cool to have one. It’s a fashion thing and a status symbol. Between the photos I collected are images of women who have exactly the same tattoo as Beyoncé or some other celebrity on exactly the same spot.”But it is certainly not simply a fashion choice for everybody, he adds. “For some Iranians it’s a way to show that their body belongs to them, apart from the theocratic state and institutionalised religion. It’s a silent act of resistance. You can censor books, you can ban films, but you cannot erase a tattoo very easily.”According to Arjmand, the new trend shows that the dynamic of Iranian society is changing. “For these young people the points of reference are no longer the mosque and the mullahs, but Hollywood and social media. Rihanna sets the trend.”Tattoos are popular among young women and there are many female tattoo artists in Tehran, such as Atefeh, 36-year-old visual artist. She became interested when she saw a Chinese tattoo of a flower online. “I thought it was gorgeous. I had never seen anything like it,” she says. “As a kind of test I tattooed it on my leg. It wasn’t perfect, but I knew I wanted to continue.”She is aware of the risk of being a tattooist, but the current economic problems in Iran make it very difficult for her to sell her paintings. “With tattooing, I can earn more money. And the money I earn, I invest in my art projects.”She receives her clients, mainly young women, in her living room. “Some want a tattoo because they think it’s sexy, or because their husband thinks it’s sexy,” she says. “They want me to tattoo his name, for example. Lines of poetry or philosophical sayings are also very popular. And Persian calligraphy. But not everybody does it because they think it’s sexy or cool. I also have clients who want Qur’anic verses on their bodies.”Mahsa, 24, sits in a cafe in the city centre. She has piercings in her nose and ears and several tattoos on her arms, some of which she has done herself. Most conspicuous is the image of a big eye on her neck. “It was always my dream to have tattoos, from when I was nine,” she says. “I don’t like jewellery. This is forever and I think that’s beautiful.”It’s not easy to look like her in Iran. This year’s Berlin film festival will show an Iranian short about a young woman who goes to renew her driving licence but is sent to a police station for her body art.“I get many negative reactions,” Mahsa says. “I hide my tattoos when I walk through the city, because it can be dangerous. People can associate the one on my neck with the evil eye and see it as a satanic thing. But it has nothing to do with that. I just think it’s beautiful.”Asked why she is prepared to run such risks, she says: “This is just who I am and it’s nobody’s business but mine.”Tattoo artist Soheil Aflaki, 28, sees tattoos as a way to stand out in a society that allows people little space for self-expression. His living room in a suburb of Tehran also serves as his tattoo studio. “I consider tattooing as a medical treatment for my generation,” he says. “It’s a way to heal the psychological wounds you sustain while living in a culture in crisis.”Aflaki started out as a self-taught painter. His interest in tattooing was sparked when a friend gave him a tattoo machine for his 19th birthday. “I learned to do it by trial and error,” he says, and laughs. “I was lucky to have friends who let me practise on their bodies.”He is now one of the best-known tattoo artists in Tehran, with more than 55,000 followers on Instagram. Among his clients are famous Iranian musicians and actors. They don’t come for roses or tribal patterns, but for Aflaki’s unique designs, which are often inspired by the character of his clients.“It’s my art that’s important to me and nothing else,” he says. “There are many other things that are not allowed in Iran, like graffiti, rock music and hip-hop. But in spite of that, many Iranians dedicate their lives to them. We all knew the situation when we started and we have come to terms with it. I don’t complain about it.”He adds: “A tattoo functions as an ‘identity maker’. It’s a way to create a unique personality. I think that’s important for young people in a country like Iran.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4338b4782e861fcd6c062cedb57350576947a7/0_86_4062_2437/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d68028d6042edd11434d8a16b712585b","title":"veganuary vegan food farming","story":"We know the world is eating too much meat, and we know that we as iniduals have to do something about it. So I was one of the record 250,000 people who signed up to Veganuary this year.I haven’t actually eaten meat for 30 years, although I occasionally ate fish and felt bad about it. Two years ago, I visited a modern British dairy farm where the cows were kept in very clean conditions, indoors, all year round. I hated it. So I switched to oat milk, and last year gave up eating cheese. But there’s still plenty of animal products in cakes and biscuits. And so, until 1 January, I wasn’t vegan.I’ve learned a lot over the last month. Years ago, I was accidentally given a vegan meal on an aircraft and it was terrible. But I’ve found it a complete untruth that vegan food is tasteless. I’ve discovered so many new flavoursome foods: vegan pies, tofu sausages and some fantastic chocolate. Vegan cheese might not satisfy a cheese connoisseur, but it’s fine for a decent cheese sandwich.I’ve also learned that our food labelling is extremely poor. Some foods labelled “vegetarian” are actually vegan, and many vegan foods are not labelled at all. Without Google, I would’ve been hopelessly lost – I’d check a brand and find the answer on a website somewhere. Perhaps a third of biscuits are vegan, but you wouldn’t know it. Original Hobnobs are vegan but some Digestives aren’t. Manufacturers are missing a trick.So are snack food outlets. The likes of Pret, Costa and Eat all have vegan food, but try finding it when rushing through a crowded station cafe.One of the triumphs of Veganuary is that I repeatedly tried to buy a Greggs vegan sausage roll and failed every time. While I was working in Bristol, I rang six branches of Greggs and all of them had sold out. There’s a huge appetite for vegan food, and restaurants and pubs are getting the message. I was surprised by how many are suddenly offering vegan menus – in Veganuary, at least. Chasing the vegan pound is increasingly smart business.Which brings me to farmers. Will our changing diets put farmers out of business? The downside of my Veganuary was that I received a vicious backlash on social media from some meat producers. Several farmers made good critical points about me eating processed vegan food that has been flown around the world. I bought vegan food wrapped in plastic. Some vegan food is industrially farmed. Some vegan food contains palm oil. If we want to eat ethically, it takes a lot of research.Ethical, environmentally friendly eating is a far more complex issue than just becoming vegan. If Britain switched instantaneously to a plant-based diet and we ripped out all the pastures and flower-rich meadows and hedgerows, and planted maize and sprayed crops with chemicals, it would be an ecological disaster.But we’ve got to help farmers move towards higher animal welfare and environmental standards. Put simply: we have to create a distinction between good and bad farmers. During Veganuary, I was contacted by some farmers who are producing higher quality, less intensively reared, high-welfare meat to sell at a premium. I visited one organic farmer friend. He fears that meat-eaters will forsake his produce for industrially farmed meat from supermarkets, and that good farmers will go out of business. Labels on meat and dairy products showing the conditions in which the animals are reared – like those graphic warnings on cigarette packets – would help good farmers. And instead of bemoaning their lost heritage or berating me on Twitter, high-welfare, environmentally friendly farmers need to unite and develop a brand so consumers will choose their high-grade meat over factory-farmed rubbish.I am not suggesting that we all go vegan overnight. Lots of people on social media told me they would go vegan three or four days a week. That, for me, is what Veganuary was all about.But because I haven’t declared all livestock farmers are evil, and because I’m not perfect, I also received vitriol from ultra-vegans. I was called a “cow rapist”. People told me I can’t be vegan and have my dog, Scratchy. The intolerance of ultra-vegans is so off-putting. You’re never going to win an argument by insulting and belittling people. A small minority make a lot of nasty noise.Three days into February, I haven’t eaten anything non-vegan yet. I’m staying vegan. But I’m not listening to the ultras and I’ll draw my own lines in the sand. I don’t see a problem with eating locally produced honey, for instance. I’m not going to take Scratchy outside and shoot him. I’m not about to burn my leather belts and shoes. To do so would be a waste of resources and just leads to the thing we’re trying to avoid – more consumption. But when my leather shoes wear out, I’ll seek a “vegan” alternative. And I’m definitely going to continue devouring tofu sausages, vegan pies and that amazing chocolate.• Chris Packham is a naturalist, nature photographer and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f531648dac7ba5a572078de9e3047d850d2ddb7d/0_114_5230_3138/master/5230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea1ac54f6df7a45b3a882bda7db1f508","title":"faith religion lgbt rights school no outsiders","story":"Recently we’ve seen several clashes between local communities and education leaders over the application of the Equality Act in Britain’s schools. Shraga Stern, the Orthodox Jewish activist, warned earlier this year that Haredi Jews would “leave the UK” if faiths schools were forced to teach children about same-sex relationships and gender reassignment. And last month, the headteacher of a school in Birmingham was petitioned by mainly Muslim parents to do away with a pilot programme called No Outsiders, which is centred around inclusion and ersity as part of sex and relationship education. Although the programme addresses issues as broad as gender, race, ageism, faith and disability, the spotlight has, inevitably, fallen on the teaching of LGBT identities.On one hand we have those who argue that schools have a duty to address issues related to difference, inclusion and social integration. On the other, there are those who are adamant that schools’ only role is to teach children the core academic curriculum, and that it is absolutely not their responsibility to address the wider question of how you live in a pluralistic society. More often than not, it feels like a stalemate.Of course, one of the primary purposes of education is to give young people a solid grounding in academic subjects, but the reality is that most schools are multi-ethnic and multi-faith. Some pupils have disabilities. Some will identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans. Children will naturally have questions about these differences, but it is dangerous to assume that they will all be able to ask these questions of their parents, or that they will necessarily be able to have open, nuanced debates with them.Plenty of adults hold views that are disparaging plenty of people are more than happy to discriminate against others based upon some aspect of their identity. Women, older people and those with disabilities are still more likely to face prejudice than their counterparts. How can you reliably assume that all parents will be able to have these conversations with their children in ways that foster openness and an appreciation of the benefits of ersity? And if they can’t speak about these issues of difference in a respectful manner, surely it will be correspondingly harder to talk respectfully about LGBT people when we know that feelings – and religious teachings – have made the debate so polarised.The No Outsiders programme was designed to address these topics with a view to increasing understanding and inclusivity. It’s a great shame that it has been attacked in this way.But there’s a difference between teaching children how to think and teaching them what to think, and perhaps that’s where the difficulty lies. It’s not the role of schools to become mouthpieces for the government, because governments have agendas that are often questionable. I would not, for example, agree with the Prevent strategy being implemented in ways that actively encouraged the marginalisation of pupils with certain demographics. Nor would I wish schools to teach students that their views on race and immigration should be in line with current UK policy.Schools do, however, have a responsibility to teach children how to live in a society that is made up of people who will have some similarities to them, as well as those who will have differences. They need to foster in their students a willingness to live alongside their fellow citizens, but there needs to be a frank and pragmatic acknowledgement that some people will struggle to accept those who identify as LGBT – and not just for reasons of faith.You cannot expect all people to accept the full spectrum of gender and sexual ersity, because that isn’t realistic. You can – and should – expect them to treat LGBT people, and disabled people and ethnic minorities as equal citizens to protect their rights, and to actively fight discrimination against them. The No Outsiders programme seems designed to do just that. On the basis of that, if nothing else, its continuation – and expansion – would, surely, be a good outcome for everyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a03f08c956d4aa5b76e887472341ebdf5b4963d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32e00650ba7b74687b4fb5700b8c422d","title":"rebuild faded towns britain","story":"New research shows a hollowing-out of communities. Our wellbeing depends on restoring the pride of placesFor the past nine years or so, I have been observing a regular journalistic ritual. In pursuit of enlightenment over where the country may be going, how people are going to vote, and their opinions about such massive issues as Brexit and Scottish independence, I have pitched up in scores of places and begun my inquiries with some version of a simple question: how is this place doing?A lot of people I meet see the decline of previously bustling places as something beyond economics and more like a moral affront, routinely describing it as “disgraceful”, “awful” and that great British commonplace “disgusting”. How they feel feeds into a widespread sense of being neglected by powerful forces that lie beyond anyone’s reach and almost beyond rational explanation. But one thing is absolutely clear: the huge economic changes the media often summarise with the term “disruption” are now a matter of daily experience, feeding into the profound anxiety about the future that defines the national mood.What perhaps gets lost in the coverage of shop closures is the deep symbolism of these losses, and how they affect a community’s basic self-esteem. It should be no great revelation that streets full of boarded-up shops eat away at a place’s sense of its own worth, and give a hollow ring to notions of “aspiration”. Marks \u0026amp Spencer, for example, is in the midst of shutting more than 100 stores between now and 2022. The latest round of planned closures includes shops in such places as Boston, Cwmbran, Weston-super-Mare and Hull.Having watched it happen elsewhere, I know this particular story well enough to understand what it means, quite apart from the job losses involved. In many places M\u0026ampS either is, or was, the last town-centre store to offer things – from clothes to food – with some semblance of quality and even luxury. When its outlets close, you either get an empty space or one that is sooner or later filled by a discount chain. Human traffic suddenly drops. The old allure of a Saturday trip to town is snuffed out. Local people get a feeling of being irredeemably downgraded.When certain stores close, two other things are suddenly lost: a symbol of shared experience, and collective connection to the past. Towards the end of last year, in the wake of House of Fraser being acquired by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct group, it was announced that the chain’s Manchester department store – long known to local people as Kendals, the name it had until 2005 – was to close. After an intervention by the city council, it was eventually granted a reprieve. But in between, I experienced a very telling mixture of sadness and bafflement, and a keen sense of how important mere “retail” can be in our idea of who we are and where we live.The store’s history goes back to the 1830s. I can remember my mum and dad going on shopping outings there. When I independently bought my first bit of clothing from the menswear department, it felt like a modest rite of passage. How, I now wondered, could Manchester exist without it – that huge, jaw-dropping art deco building, the wafts of perfume that floated out of the ground floor, the cafe and restaurant on the fourth floor that suburbanites such as me once thought of as the acme of sophistication?Whatever happens to that store, central Manchester does not look likely to join the list of places where the number of vacant premises is turning critical. But elsewhere the future may look forlorn. Shops, moreover, are only one facet of a general hollowing-out. As banks close their branches, places lose not just symbols of local commerce but a vital service for businesspeople. (Where else do they get their change?) When a pub closes down, bang goes a precious shared space. The effects of austerity on libraries, museums, day centres and more is self-evident. And the terror of the current moment is that even the places that once claimed to have superseded traditional retail and commerce are now threatened by the new world of online everything: what, you can only wonder, are we going to do with vacant malls and shopping centres?To even begin to answer these challenges, a place needs a mixture of things too often in short supply. One is high-quality local politicians motivated by civic pride, and with an ability to use their imaginations. In some places you see flashes of what this might mean. In Doncaster the council has plans for a radical reinvention of the town centre: rejuvenated markets streets to be filled with restaurants, bars and cafes buildings converted into living spaces – a mushrooming of the kind of creativity that has turned a former branch of British Home Stores into a huge trampolining centre. Even if there are huge obstacles, this is impressive and exciting. But in smaller places, it is still hard to shake off a sense that the 21st century is going to be defined by a kind of capitalism that will offer much more destruction than creation.Clearly, we are not going pull ourselves away from Amazon and suddenly return to a halcyon era of sweets sold by the quarter and “Can I help you?”. But this country is in a weird, tortured state, and the condition of so many of its towns and cities is at the heart of its angst. When the Brexit mess starts to recede, and we finally get to talk about how on earth we are going to handle the future, this is where everything needs to start: in the places we still honour with such words as “centre” and “heart” – where fatalism and despondency need to be turned round, before it is too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1708c11b626446358b0ea5fe59c04e6aef662d/0_357_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03854c58eb70f40e8b1a4ab3fba47dad","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pleasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pleasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pleasure’.Share your photos of what pleasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 February at 10am.

Other places out of range include Liverpool, Nottingham, Birkenhead and South Shields. Wealthier areas such as Exeter, Bath, Oxford and Brighton are far better connected.Emma Marrington of the CPRE said: “When the most beautiful parts of England’s countryside were given national park status, or designated as AONBs, they were done so as a public good – so that everyone could enjoy the benefits that access to them can bring.“But a huge amount of people are currently missing out. Regular interaction with the natural world – fresh air, exercise, escaping the stresses and strains of urban living, just being in the great outdoors – is inextricably linked to increased levels of health and happiness.”The CPRE hopes that if more people visit national parks, public support will grow for the protection of the natural environment, which the group seeks to protect against developments such as fracking and high-volume housebuilding.Studies have suggested that living in green spaces, or even justvisiting them, can help people recover from stress and mental fatigue, can reduce blood pressure and may even accelerate healing after surgery, according to the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health at Edinburgh and Glasgow universities. But reaching theses spaces is getting harder, according to a former government advisor on accessibility to national parks.“Rural bus networks have been cut back and cut back so that a round a quarter of the population who do not have a car are denied access to national parks,” said Colin Speakman, who volunteers for DalesBus, a service operated by a community interest company that takes people from Leeds, Middlesbrough, Bradford, Lancaster and Preston to the Yorkshire Dales for about £8 return.It runs all year but is busiest in summer, when it operates 12 routes and carries up to 3,500 passengers a week.Almost half of the passengers live alone and close to a third have physical or mental health problems.“We pick up a large number of older, single people who have been widowed or live on their own and for whom a trip to a national park is a lifeline to keep them sane,” Speakman said.The service costs about £100,000 a year in subsidies. A similar service has been set up for the North York Moors. Speakman wants the government to fund a wider roll-out.“One million pounds for the 10 national parks would allow each to have a beautiful, fully integrated network from the conurbations,” he said. “It’s peanuts. Our subsidy from the national parks is £5,000.”The 10 parks receive £48.7m a year in government funding.National Parks England said enabling access to all sections of society was a challenge. Tony Gates, the chief executive of Northumberland national park, said the parks wanted to develop better transport links. It also wants to create a partnership with the NHS to make sure every child can visit a national park while at school.Gates said: “Clearly a big challenge in achieving this will be providing access to transport. National park authorities would love to see more support and investment in this area to enable us to realise the significant opportunities which national parks provide for people’s health and wellbeing.”Julian Glover, a former speechwriter for David Cameron who is leading the government’s landscape review, said that as well as turning around the decline in the natural environment of some areas it was also necessary to make sure they could “ be understood and enjoyed by all parts of a changing society”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79377cc4a58858c72991ba9a70ce2aef4047e1bc/0_386_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c609de6b178848a4e6b5cbdb592ef368","title":"ineos chairman jim ratcliffe criticises government fracking policies","story":"Ministers are playing politics with the country’s future, says Ineos boss Sir Jim RatcliffeThe UK’s richest person has launched an attack on the government’s fracking rules, accusing ministers of policies that will cause an “energy crisis” and “irreparable damage” to the economy.Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemicals firm Ineos, pledged four years ago to start a UK fracking revolution but the company has been bogged down in planning battles and is yet to drill or frack a single well.The businessman, who is worth £21bn, accused the government of taking an unworkable and unhelpful position on seismicity and planning rules.“They are playing politics with the future of the country. We have a non-existent energy strategy and are heading towards an energy crisis that will do long term and irreparable damage to the economy and the government needs to decide whether they are finally going to put the country first and develop a workable UK onshore gas industry,” said Ratcliffe, who is leaving the UK for tax-free Monaco.Labour said the intervention “smacked of desperation” and was made by a “fracking corporation who knows that time is up”.“The government can no longer get away with overpromising to industry and allowing earthquakes against the wishes of local communities,” said shadow energy minister, Alan Whitehead.Ineos, which owns significant exploration rights in the UK, said it wants the limit at which fracking operations must be paused to be raised, from its current level of 0.5 magnitude. It said the ceiling should be a “sensible” level but did not specify what that would be.Cuadrilla, the only shale gas company to have fracked in the UK, had to repeatedly halt fracking at its site near Blackpool last year, as its operations triggered minor earthquakes above the regulatory threshold.Geologists have said the limit could safely be raised to 1.5 magnitude, above most of the mild tremors Cuadrilla caused.But the energy minister, Claire Perry, told the  last month that she had no plans to review the rules. She has previously said only a “foolish politician” would do so.In a statement issued on Monday, Ineos attacked the government for setting the limit at 0.5, which it called “a level that has no sound basis in science and betrays a total lack of understanding of the shale extraction process”.The firm pointed to other countries that have much more relaxed rules on seismicity and fracking. But the UK government has repeatedly said that one of the virtues of a UK shale gas industry is that it would be tightly and robustly regulated.Tom Pickering, chief operating officer of Ineos Shale, said he “would not speculate” on whether the company would scrap its fracking plans if seismic rules are not reviewed. But he said: “What we are saying is the time is now. We really do need to get clarity.”The company has spent more than £150m on shale gas plans so far, and its fracking arm employs has 10 staff.Ineos claimed the government was “shutting down shale by the back door” and branded the planning regime “archaic, glacially slow, inordinately expensive and virtually unworkable”.Ministers have already rewritten planning rules to speed up shale gas applications and have proposed a second batch of reforms to make it easier for shale companies to drill exploratory wells.However, all three Ineos shale gas sites were rejected by local authorities. Two of those – one in South Yorkshire and one in Derbyshire – have since been approved after the firm appealed. The company is appealing over a third, at Woodsetts in South Yorkshire.Ineos argued the UK had chosen to bet “the future of our manufacturing industry on windmills and imported gas from countries which are potentially unstable”.A government risk assessment last week concluded that UK gas supplies were “resilient to all but the most unlikely combination of high demand and supply disruption”.Jamie Peters, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Today’s outburst feels like a final desperate plea from an unwanted, struggling industry. Jim Ratcliffe is right that the UK needs a new energy policy, but one that’s based on energy-saving and renewables, not fracking and more fossil fuels.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99bbd6e41e83f2d781e626867979fba409f8e948/0_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0080fb119ab5585cb1e59df271d0b13","title":"swansea tidal lagoon plan government","story":"Firm hopes to build scheme within six years after ministers rejected it for being too costlyThe backers of a pioneering project to harness energy from the tides off the Welsh coast have rebooted the scheme and believe they can build it without the help of government.With the recent failure of two major nuclear projects, attention has turned to alternatives to fill the low-carbon power gap, with developers of windfarms and small nuclear plants among those vying for government support.Now the firm behind the proposed Swansea tidal lagoon, for which ministers rejected subsidies  last year on the grounds it was too costly, has said it believes the project can work without government money and be built within six years.Swansea-based Tidal Power plc said several major companies were interested in buying the low-carbon electricity generated by the tide flowing through turbines in a concrete wall along Swansea bay.Property company Land Securities, Cardiff airport and developer Berkeley Group are among those to have expressed an interest in signing a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the lagoon.Such PPA deals are typically used by big energy users as a way of hedging against future power price rises, or burnishing green credentials by buying from renewable sources. A record 13.4 gigawatts of clean energy contracts were signed last year, according to BloombergNEF.The lagoon’s backers also believe its prospects will be boosted by adding floating solar panels to the lagoon, ramping up the amount of electricity it generates. UK water companies have already used floating solar power on reservoirs in Manchester, near Heathrow and elsewhere.The addition of solar should increase the Swansea lagoon’s annual energy output by more than a third, up from 572 gigawatt hours, enough to power about 150,000 homes, to about 770GWh.Chris Nutt, the business development manager at Tidal Power, said: “It is becoming widely understood that there is a huge hole left in our long-term energy demands and after the latest cancellation of expected new nuclear capacity our choices if anything have become simpler – saturate the UK coastline with offshore wind or invest in groundbreaking solutions like Swansea Bay.”The company is sounding out big energy users, including leading brands in the professional services, telecoms, media, manufacturing, services and utilities sectors.Mark Bailey, the director of planning and development at Cardiff airport, said: “The tidal lagoon project … could be a game changer for the Welsh economy.”The plan is to secure enough signed PPAs by the end of the year to enable a final investment decision in early 2020, with construction starting shortly afterwards. If that timetable were met, the project would be generating power in 2024 or 2025.Going ahead without subsidies would be a rarity for a new power station in the UK, almost all of which rely on some form of government contract or subsidy before being greenlit.Advocates of the project have said the predictability of the tides could be useful as nuclear falters and variable sources such as solar and wind power grow. But government has been sceptical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc20c23ddbfac4f2bcfeabb8472b059a1866d11/11_353_653_392/master/653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20a5bfae597912c6537656a45e9a714e","title":"green book poster philippines","story":"A cartoon-laden design advertising the worthy race drama in the Philippines is too bad to be true. Could this be the late PR boost the film needs?Green Book is slowly emerging as one of the big villains of Oscar season. Second only to the unimpeachable cruddiness of Bohemian Rhapsody, Green Book has been lambasted for applying a white perspective to a black issue, for misrepresentating its lead character, for the writer’s Islamophobic tweet, its director’s historical penchant for sexual misconduct and the star’s willingness to say the N-word in public. Green Book is, at this point, completely unlovable. Only a miracle could restore its reputation.But what’s this galloping in from the horizon? A charmingly terrible poster being used to advertise the film in the Philippines? A poster so classically, catastrophically inept that it somehow orbits out past “awful” and all the way back to “incredible”? A poster that contains, for all the world, two separate instances of actual clip art where a smiling white man stands arm-in-arm with a smiling black man?It is. And it’s glorious. Compare this poster with the original Green Book poster, which is a by-the-numbers study in dreariness, a groaning caricature of take-me-seriously Oscar bait. The graphics are spare. The fonts are tasteful. The tagline – “Inspired by a true friendship” – contains enough worthy sap to make you bilious. Everything about the poster says: “I’ll add this to my Netflix list 18 months from now but never get around to watching it.”The Filipino version, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. The font gives the impression of a zany comedy, but the clip art cartoon of police officers in the top corner adds an element of danger. The actors still look moodily inscrutable, but this is offset by the clip art cartoon of a man playing the piano. And the sombre wilderness of old? Forget it: now they’re sitting in a car in the middle of the city, baby! It all looks like so much fun. No wonder the cartoon men that have been slapped around the edges are smiling so broadly. This film looks like a blast!There’s probably a sensible explanation for the weirdness of the Filipino poster. Perhaps it’s a cultural issue. Perhaps it’s down to the local distributor, which is notorious for its awful posters (see its poster for The Upside, which screams “#1 MOVIE IN AMERICA, DEFEATING AQUAMAN”. But that’s by the by – I would much rather see this film than the one advertised by the original poster. That one is flaccid this one is joyous.Perhaps this is the future of movie posters. Look at the rest of this year’s Oscar crop. Would you go and watch The Wife? Really? But what if its poster was covered in pasted-in graphics? What if Glenn Close’s face was replaced by a giant depiction of the one-eyed tongue-out emoji? What if the title was printed in comic sans? What if its tagline was changed to “Oh boy, this is one crazy wife!”? Tell me you wouldn’t watch that. Of course you would.In the meantime, it’s not too late for Green Book. The Oscars are still some way off, and this poster gives its campaign something to lean in to. Universal should run across-the-board “For your consideration” adverts using the Filipino version. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali should pose for a new series of Microsoft Word clip art images. I can’t believe I’m the first person to think of this. The statuette is back in your grasp, Green Book. Don’t blow this chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209a9f4a391a5b83d2641dcee944ad8e81f0677e/435_132_3069_1840/master/3069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2531e6296964b19f25e70ead1817c390","title":"how we made goldeneye james bond pierce brosnan xenia onatopp 007","story":"A tank flattened a camera, M called him a sexist dinosaur and his fights with Onatopp were so rough they needed a padded cell … the Irish actor recalls his 007 debutThe first film I saw when I came to London as a boy was Goldfinger, which starred Sean Connery as 007. In Ireland, I had been brought up on a diet of Old Mother Riley and Norman Wisdom, so it was a bedazzling moment, seeing this lady covered in gold paint. I ended up getting a toy car with an ejector seat, but I didn’t have any aspirations to be James Bond. The character who really captured my imagination was Oddjob, Goldfinger’s bowler-hatted henchman.I was originally offered the role of 007 for The Living Daylights. I’d done all the photos with the iconic gun pose and my late wife and I were about to toast our new life with a bottle of Cristal when my agent called and said: “It’s fallen through.” It was because I couldn’t get out of Remington Steele. The role went to Timothy Dalton instead but, by the mid-90s, the franchise had been dormant for six years because of a rights dispute. I heard rumblings that the part was available, but ignored them because I didn’t want to put myself back in that emotional vortex. Then I met the producers Cubby and Barbara Broccoli and, a week later, they called and said: “You’re in.”The sceptics were out in full: the world felt there was no need for another James Bond. So the challenge was enormous. I didn’t want to get caught between what Sean and Roger had done. Yet, at the end of the day, my take was a little bit of what both had brought to the role. I leant towards Sean’s style, but I couldn’t deny Roger because GoldenEye was in the tongue-in-cheek style people had become used to.It was a demanding role, physically and emotionally. I did a lot of wirework and fight sequences. They created a padded cell for the fight in the bathhouse with Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), so we could go at it pretty hard. The most arduous fight was the one with Sean Bean, on the ladder over the giant radio telescope at the end. He and I spent six weeks constructing the sequence, working on it during our lunch breaks and at the end of the day with a stunt coordinator. But carrying myself as Bond was as much a mental as a physical thing. You have to hold the stage. You go in to win, full tilt to the finish line.GoldenEye’s success was a great relief. I was prepared for the attention. Once you have that brand, you’re stamped as a Bond. It was a great irony playing a British cultural icon as an Irishman. I had a quiet chuckle to myself.It’s exciting breaking in a new Bond. I did Daniel Craig’s first one, too. You’ve got something to work with. The producers had been checking other people out just in case. I think they may have looked at Mel Gibson and Ralph Fiennes. But it was obvious Pierce was the right person. You couldn’t get a better-looking Bond. Put him in a tuxedo and it’s game over, mate.It was budgeted at $55m, which is ludicrously little by today’s standards. I think United Artists had doubts about how the audience would respond after the big gap since the last film. The press had been asking if Bond was still relevant. We decided we had to address this, so we introduced Judi Dench as M, and had her call him a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. The girls, too, were very independent – in the past, they always hung on to Bond’s coat-tails. I loved Famke Janssen’s orgasmic thigh-crushing as Xenia Onatopp.With Bond, we used to say: “What’s never been done before action-wise?” It’s quite difficult after 16 films. GoldenEye’s bungee jump off a dam at the start was my idea. We used the Contra dam in Switzerland, which is bloody terrifying. There was no digital manipulation: the stuntman Wayne Michaels just did the 700ft jump. As they were doing the countdown, he saw the guy on the crane crossing himself. He did it perfectly the first time. I guess he didn’t want to do a second.We were getting very tight on budget by the time we got to the tank chase through the streets of St Petersburg, so we built replica streets in the studios at Leavesden. We had three or four Soviet battle tanks, T-55s, the proverbial unstoppable force. You just let the bloody thing go and it knocks anything down. One crashed through a wall, ran over a Panavision camera and flattened it. A couple of companies turned us down for the bit where it smashes through a drinks truck. Perrier ended up getting a good ad out of it. GoldenEye was probably the first Bond film to really cash in on product placement.I turned down Pierce’s subsequent Bond films. There’s always a madman taking over the world and a control room that has to be blown up. The producers felt the last of the Brosnan Bond films, Die Another Day, had got too fantastical, with the invisible car and the ice palace. They decided there had to be a complete rethink. That’s how Casino Royale came about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf706bfccd1e6cb60039e608bb77ac621839c4aa/551_38_1601_961/master/1601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b990fa724f90672e6ff9e2ec096b6b10","title":"rami malek says working with director bryan singer on bohemian rhapsody was not pleasant","story":"The Oscar-nominated actor has spoken out about his experiences filming Bohemian RhapsodyRami Malek, the Oscar frontrunner for his role as Freddie Mercury in biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, has spoken out against the film’s sometime director Bryan Singer.Speaking at the Santa Barbara film festival, an emotional Malek said: “My situation with Bryan, it was not pleasant, not at all. And that’s about what I can say about it at this point.”Singer was replaced as director by Dexter Fletcher well into production, but retains sole credit, and the sexual abuse allegations that emerged shortly after his being fired were not cited as the cause for his exit.However, Malek urged the audience to seek succour from Singer’s fate.“For anyone who is seeking any solace in all of this,” he said, “Bryan Singer was fired. Bryan Singer was fired – I don’t think that was something anyone saw coming but I think that had to happen and it did.”Malek has previously said he was unaware of the allegations against Singer before shooting, but has spoken of “creative differences” with the director and of the “tumultuous” set. The latest claims against Singer were detailed in a recent article in The Atlantic, in which Singer was accused by four men of having sex with them while they were underage.“My heart goes out to anyone who has to live through anything like what I’ve heard and what is out there,” said Malek. “It’s awful, it’s remarkable that this happens, I can appreciate so much what they’ve been through and how difficult this must be for them. In the light of the #MeToo era, that this somehow seems to exist after that, it’s a horrible thing.”Winner of the best drama Golden Globe last month, Bohemian Rhapsody has been a break-out hit of this awards season, taking $800m (£613m) at the global box office.

For, although they can be cultivated perennially, this is their true season in the eastern hemisphere. And it couldn’t be better timing, nature summoning the brightest, most playful and irreducible fruit for the darkest, coldest days.This is the point where I usually insert a story about living in the land where the lemons grow, but I have done that for the last two years in this column. Also, I’ve just reread the lemon chapter in Jane Grigson’s Fruit Book where she quotes Goethe – “Do you know that country, where the lemon trees flower” – and refers to it as the best but also most hackneyed poem, which in turn made me feel hackneyed. Her description of drinking a cold lemon spremuta is spot on: how the crystals of sugar collect at the bottom of the glass, how lemon-ish it is, and acidic, so much so that it makes your throat a bit sore for a while. It is the same with glycerin, lemon and honey, a mum’s cure for sore throats that exacerbates before it soothes and you fall asleep with sticky lemon lips and slightly numb tonsils.In February, lemons, abundant and good, become the main ingredient, in throat-tickling, lip cut-stinging lemonade (which I have always thought of as a winter drink) and in marmalade, glossy curd, fierce pickles, moons preserved under an avalanche of coarse salt (not that I have ever done this), the heart of a Margaret Costa lemon surprise pudding – the baked pud with surprise pool of lemon curd at the bottom – one of the very best recipes from one of the very best books (Four Seasons Cookery Book), and the essence of Fabrizia Lanza’s Sicilian pudding. And, while baking a butter rubbed chicken with a lemon stuffed inside has no season, it seems particularly appropriate at this time of year, the rich, lemon scented (italians say aspro) gravy waiting for boiled potatoes or wilted greens.There is also risotto al limone, which, like salt toothpaste and lemon halves on elbows, didn’t appeal when I first spotted it by way of Anna del Conte, who was given the recipe by Romana Bosco, who was taught it by Giovanna Gloria – recipe credits rather like the accumulative game of When I Went Shopping.It was a question from a reader that prompted me to try a risotto with lemon as its star.Risotto, a (hopefully) harmonious fusion of starchy rice, butter, stock and cheese, is, by its very nature, rich and creamy, the addition of mascarponerobiola (my choice) or cream (Del Conte also suggests an egg yolk) making it even more so, which is why the lemon is so important and beautiful. The effect is twofold: the zest, with its essential oil, acts as an almost hot perfume, while the juice gives acidity, a blithe spirit up against the richness – which is, in turn, edible defence against these February days with their grey sky afternoons and interminable evenings.60g butter2 tbsp olive oil2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped1 stick celery, finely choppedSalt and black pepper350g risotto rice (arborio or canaroli)100ml dry white wine or 50ml dry vermouth1-1.25 litres light chicken or vegetable stock, simmering1 large unwaxed lemon (zest and juice)75g mascarpone or robiola60g parmesan, gratedIn a large, heavy-based frying pan or enamel-based cast iron casserole, warm half the butter and all the oil over a medium-low flame then gently fry stew the onion and celery along with a pinch of salt until soft and translucent - this will take about seven minutes. Add the rice and stir until each grain glistens – you want them to become partly translucent and to smell slightly toasty.In another pan on the back of the stove, keep the stock at a simmer.Raise the flame, add the wine or vermouth and let it bubble and evaporate for a minute. Start to add the stock, ladle by ladle, stirring continuously while everything bubbles at a lively pace, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed by the rice before adding the next. Add the lemon zest after 10 minutes. Continue until the rice is tender but with a slight nutty bite, and the risotto is soft and rippling. This can take anything from 17 - 25 minutes depending on the rice you are using: keep tasting.Pull the pan from the heat and, using a wooden spoon, firmly beat the remaining butter, mascarpone, parmesan, two tablespoons of lemon juice and a generous grind of black pepper into the rice. Cover the pan and leave to rest for one minute. Beat again and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0292000b97392f7f268bcd6b627a1f63a6b23c9/0_22_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=119934835c42f56a5ca77d3bb72d6503","title":"bayern munich stunned as luck goes same way as aura of invincibility","story":"Concern is beginning to turn to what Liverpool might do to a team incapable of producing 90 minutes of energy and focusThe myth of Bayern-Dusel has endured in German football for more than four decades – the concept of the perennial luck that pushes even the below-elite teams representing the Rekordmeister over the hump. It’s become such a Bundesliga cliché that Bastian Schweinsteiger reflected on one late winner in the closing stages of 2009-10 under Louis van Gaal as Bayern-Dusel being “back again” with a grin on his face.One wondered on Saturday afternoon if, in 2019, the concept of the luck of a behemoth is as possible as it once was. Bayern Munich were sticking to their script – the script of modern German football – as half-time approached at Bayer Leverkusen. They already led through Leon Goretzka’s latest goal and shortly after the home side’s teenage star Kai Havertz limped off, Robert Lewandowski looked to have put them two up, deftly flicking the ball wide of Lukas Hradecky and into the corner of the net from Kingsley Coman’s pass, the culmination of a razor-sharp move.The assistant’s flag, however, was up, much to Lewandowski’s incredulity and to Bayern’s, with Niko Kovač grumbling that VAR officials confirming the call “must have had the centimetre measure out”. It recalled the moment when José Mourinho used a press conference a few days after Real Madrid’s 2011 Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona to ridicule Pep Guardiola for being “a man who criticises the referee when he makes good decisions”.To repeat that barb about Kovač would be as wilfully deliberate a misunderstanding as Mourinho was making all those years over Barcelona. His lament didn’t even go as far as suggesting that calling a player for a fractional offside might be against the spirit of the law. It was simply an observation that it had been tight. When the tight calls aren’t going Bayern’s way, the concept of Dusel of any sort seems a little antiquated, just as their aura of invincibility has become this season.It all fell to bits after the break, beginning when Leon Bailey swerved a magnificent free-kick past Sven Ulreich – playing after Manuel Neuer injured his hand – for an equaliser, which was also the Jamaican’s first goal since the second game of the season. The tide turned, and Kevin Volland put the hosts in front before Lucas Alario rounded it off in the closing minutes.Those last two goals in particular exposed the holes in Bayern’s game that had been papered over in recent games, with Leverkusen’s counter-attacks (which promise to be a key element of the newly-inaugurated Peter Bosz era) just too fast for the visitors during a second half in which they faded and looked ponderous, as they often have this term. It was the fifth time already this season that Bayern have dropped points after taking the lead and this one, after a run of seven straight league victories leading into it, was probably the most shocking. There had been the feeling of a corner being turned, but that sentiment dissipated in the course of a visceral half-hour from the hosts.It was, as Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Sebastian Fischer wrote: “An indication of insufficient tactical flexibility for the highest level.” Kovač acknowledged as much after the match. Which was “good, because he’s responsible for analysis”, continued Fischer, “but bad, because as a coach he’s also responsible for the tactics. He’s a coach, mind you, who stands for defensive stability”.Kovač’s moves over the winter break were supposed to cement that, with his confirmation of Niklas Süle as the team’s No 1 centre-half, and with Mats Hummels and Jérôme Boateng fighting it out to partner him – Hummels has won the vote so far in 2019. Here, he represented Bayern’s unevenness, which has become the shadow hanging over their season. On Saturday Hummels often looked his best self on the ball elegant, ambitious, a cut above. Off it – sometimes after giving it away himself – he looked uncertain of his position, and even lost. Leverkusen knew exactly how to take advantage.“Going forward, our team has great qualities,” argued Kovač, “but we have to shut up shop. Everyone knows the championship is won at the back.” Some would argue that therein lies the problem, with a coach who is thinking of being cautious rather than daring. Then again, if those principles were followed more closely, it’s difficult to argue that Bayern wouldn’t be in a better position.The club’s former midfielder Didi Hamann took aim at Lewandowski on Sunday night’s edition of Sky90, arguing that the star centre-forward “is becoming a problem for Bayern”. Certainly, if Kovač wants his team to defend from the front then Lewandowski is short-changing him. He is not the only one, with Thomas Müller and James Rodríguez substituted in the second half and looking glum about it. That Lewandowski is still in Bavaria, having openly coveted a move to Real Madrid, might be taken as an admission of shortcoming, but he looks short of the all-round game which would propel him back into those sort of conversations.Maybe a rebuild around him would make the difference. That is firmly on the Bayern agenda, though the plan to freshen the squad this winter didn’t come to fruition, with Lucas Hernández staying at Atlético for now and Benjamin Pavard still at Stuttgart until summer. One can’t hope for more than a period of adaptation from Alphonso Davies.Yet it means for now that the squad is limited, certainly in terms of variety, with Sandro Wagner moving to China last week – not that Kovač was keen on picking him anyway. Borussia Dortmund failed to land a knockout blow this weekend, and Bayern still have their hopes alive. With Leverkusen exposing them like this, though, concern is beginning to turn to what Liverpool might do to a team still incapable of producing 90 minutes of energy and focus, when the Champions League restarts.• Dortmund, then, extended their lead to seven points despite letting a lead slip – and failing to take a host of chances to restore it – in an entertaining draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Marco Reus, who opened the scoring before Luka Jović levelled, was the chief culprit. Goalkeeper Roman Bürki grudgingly called Bayern’s stumble “a small consolation”, though cameras preferred to focus on Axel Witsel struggling to supress a grin as the score from Leverkusen popped up on the big screen.• Borussia Mönchengladbach are up to second after chiselling out a 2-0 win at Schalke with late goals by Christoph Kramer and Florian Neuhaus, the second being an extraordinary piece of work, the result of 62 passes over two minutes and 45 seconds of possession.• At the bottom there was relief for Augsburg – and new assistant coach Jens Lehmann – with Alfred Finnbogason’s hat-trick rolling over Mainz and giving them breathing space at the bottom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b20a8e9dc84d2f711e0c266bfb5a417e58bca814/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce4610d439e3ab5a2773e67ce59b843","title":"10 of the best bluetooth headphones","story":"Whether you’re embarking on a Fortnite marathon, running an actual marathon or just want some tuneful isolation on your commute, there’s a set of Bluetooth headphones that’ll do the jobThe minute Apple ditched the traditional headphone jack from its phones, the future of Bluetooth headphones was pretty much sealed.

These may seem trivial compared with more significant hurdles (moving house, losing a job or the death of a parent), but research shows that how a couple manages these smaller stresses massively affects how they cope with bigger ones. Notice how you are feeling – overburdened? neglected? – and, rather than store these feelings up, talk to your partner about it. If you’re on the receiving end, listen, ask questions, and try to understand the other person’s perspective. Being understood helps the “sufferer” feel less alone, and a couple feel more intimate. Couples I work with as a therapist, even those in long-term relationships, are often surprised at how the other person is feeling.”Share the load: Remember, major stress can affect both parties: if one person loses a job, for example, the other may feel added pressure or mourn their partner’s loss of status. It can help to think of relationship strains as a “we” problem – “how can we tackle this?” – rather than one inidual shouldering the burden alone. Partners sometimes block each other from attempting change, taking the role of “gatekeeper” and believing it’s safer to do things “their way”. For the tired parent who complains about doing bathtime, what might they miss without that reconnection with the children at the end of the day? Or can the partner who resents doing the weekly shop tolerate groceries they wouldn’t choose? A couple needs to arrive at a “good enough” solution that meets both their needs.Communicate: Difficulties often start with a breakdown in communication. Partners in distress stop sharing their thoughts, their minds swamped by hurts and fears that build up in shared lives. Don’t suffer alone: you need to talk. Confronting things can lead to a renewed sense of closeness and a lessening of stress confrontation doesn’t have to mean raised voices and a loss of control. Do it with a spirit of curiosity – not at 11.30pm after a few glasses of wine, or to “out” who you think has got it wrong – and you’ll discover that your relationship can be a tremendous resource against day-to-day difficulties.Kate Thompson is a couple psychoanalytic psychotherapist and clinical lecturer at Tavistock RelationshipsDon’t be a martyr: Ask for help. If you’re feeling genuinely overwhelmed, speak to your manager about solutions that might alleviate your stress, whether that means removing a project from your workload or getting more support from your colleagues.Prioritise: Take a long hard look at your to-do list – is there anything you can do to make it more manageable? Be ruthless in figuring out what you can delay, delegate, or skip altogether.Break it up: An eight-hour (or longer) working day without any proper breaks is a recipe for disaster. Aim for shorter periods of focused activity interspersed with regular breaks – and never skip lunch, away from your desk.Talk it out: Find a friend or colleague you trust to talk through your problems. A fresh perspective might help.Say ‘no’ more often: Stretching yourself too thin in a bid to accommodate every request is a surefire way to escalate your stress levels. Don’t let your inner people-pleaser trick you into overcommitting to work at the expense of your own sense of calm.Establish email boundaries: The expectation that we respond to work emails even when we’re not technically “on the clock” is a blight of modern working culture. Try to pull back, gradually – start by not checking your emails at all on Saturdays and work your way up, until you’re rarely checking your emails outside of work hours.Evaluate your environment: Maybe it’s them, not you. Some workplaces are just toxic environments, and instead of tying yourself in knots trying to make things work, sometimes it’s best to just ... bow out. It might be time to start looking for a job elsewhere.Treat yourself: Don’t forget to reward yourself for a job well done. Whether it’s a long bath, a slap-up meal or a spot of retail therapy, never underestimate the power of some straight-up indulgence to boost your spirits and rejuvenate the soul.Create rituals: Family stress often follows change, which falls roughly into two types: the normal life cycles we all face – a new job, a baby, a house move, the death of an elderly parent, a child starting school – and unexpected change, such as a job loss, illness, or diagnosis of a mental health condition. For the former, it helps to create rituals around these life-cycle stages, to make the transition easier and acknowledge the change (depending on your cultural or religious background, you may have these already, such as bar and batmitzvahs). These could include a graduation dinner, a housewarming party or retirement party. Unexpected changes are harder to navigate because the family hasn’t evolved a way of coping with them.  In these cases, it may help to talk to someone – a family friend, a community elder, or a professional.Prioritise family time: Set aside time together as a family. Any shared activity is good: board games eating together at least three times a week, without screens at the table watching a film even car journeys, if you have one. I often suggest parents spend one-on-one time with different children too, to create opportunities for conversations about their school lives and friendships.Realise you’re all in it together: In family therapy, there is usually one person whom everyone is most concerned about at any one time, but it’s important not to blame an inidual for a family breakdown. Try to separate the person from the problem: for example, a family may feel they have a “naughty child”, so create a name or character for the “naughtiness” – Horrid Henry, say – and keep a record of every time your child let’s him get the better of them. This can also help the family realise that the symptom may be present in every family member. Focusing on one “problem” person in the family can also obscure another problem – for example, parents may discover they have issues in their own relationship.Avoid the blame game: It’s helpful to distinguish between blame and responsibility: everyone in a family has to take responsibility for behaviour that is problematic, and help to do things different in the future.Dr Reenee Singh is chief executive of the Association of Family TherapyLive in the now: Try not to get too hung up on what may or may not happen to your finances over the long term, such as how you’re ever going to pay off your student debt, or whether you will ever get on the housing ladder. Similarly, don’t dwell on financial mistakes you may have made in the past and that you probably now can’t do anything about. They can seem mammoth and insurmountable. The fact is, focusing on what you’re spending right now is the best way to protect your financial future.Be honest with yourself: Carry out an audit of your income, expenditure and debts. Look at what you spend on the essentials and the basics, such as your mortgage or energy bills. You may well be able to cut your costs by switching to another provider (many services now offer to do this automatically for you).Facing up to the reality of your finances, and exercising some control over them will boost your confidence. Happily, there are a string of smartphone apps that can do some of the legwork for you – and the new breed of digital current accounts such as Monzo and Loot are all simple to use and typically let you set dailyweeklymonthly budgets, analyse your spending and create savings goals.Face the facts and figures: Don’t ignore letters, calls and emails. This will just make things worse, so take a deep breath and sort through that pile of letters that you’ve been trying to pretend don’t exist. If you are sweating over a money problem, talking to family members or friends might produce useful advice or a solution.Get help: There are many sources of free impartial advice. Several organisations can put you in touch with a debt counsellor who can help you come up with a repayment strategy.

The trick is to find an approach (such as classes, online tutorials, books or apps) and a practice (from mindfulness to transcendental meditation) you enjoy. “If you’re putting yourself through some torturous process because ‘That’s what I should be doing’, then it isn’t easy or enjoyable, and most likely you won’t stick with it.”Dan Harris, a US newscaster and the author of Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics, advises abandoning the idea of lengthy practices when you are starting out. Instead opt for more manageable chunks that you can slot into daily life. Just five to 10 minutes’ meditation a day can be enough to feel the benefits, Harris told NPR – even one minute a day is worthwhile.It is more important that you feel comfortable than it is to be straining to maintain a certain posture, says Lavender. From sitting on the floor in a full lotus position to using a cushion or chair, choose what feels best.Lavender, a Vedic meditation teacher, tells her students: “Anywhere you can sit down, you can meditate.” Developing that ease around it means there is a higher chance of fitting it in, she says. Start by finding somewhere you feel warm, comfortable and not too self-conscious.While some say using an app to meditate misses the point, others find them to be a useful and accessible resource. Headspace and Calm are two of the best-known offerings, but they charge to unlock more content. Insight Timer brings together 15,000 free guided meditations, while Smiling Mind was designed with children and teenagers in mind. Buddhify and Simple Habit deliver nuggets for specific moments such as before a big meeting or winding down for bedtime.Stopping and starting is part of the process of learning to meditate. Harris says trying to refocus your attention when it has wandered is like a “biceps curl for the brain”. Just pick yourself up again, says Lavender. “Dipping in for a few minutes will make a difference. If you have a moment on the train and you take the moment to sit, give yourself a breather and close your eyes, great.”As with any new technique that you are trying to learn, it is worth investing some time researching about meditation. If you are after a cheap and easy taster before committing to a course or retreat, the NHS offers a bedtime meditation video, while some local councils offer free weekly meditation classes. Have a look online to see what’s on offer in your area. The charities Mind and Age UK also provide guides on mindfulness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98d1c2d0a262455ee229eb1f34c42dabf6a6184f/21_60_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ccf170db72b5b7929b39d6c4815ba1","title":"china lunar new year of the pig","story":"Millions of Chinese people have begun the world’s largest annual human migration, leaving major cities to return to their hometowns for the holiday.

Beginning with an undulating ripple of acoustic guitar, it becomes a rumbustious knees-up, the Paul Simon-worthy chorus cresting into a euphoric breakbeat croonalong reminiscent of Beck’s biggest pop moments. Once they wore their cosmopolitanism on their sleeves – now they’ve woven it into the fabric.Koffee is 18-year-old Mikayla Simpson, who recently graduated in high school in Spanish Town, Jamaica. Her fourth single shows a sharper side to the rising reggae star than her softer, previous tracks. The dubbed-out horns subtly amplify the threats she suggests in her lyrics: to blow away the competition (“Say dem badder dan me so me kill dem and study dem anatomy”), and for Jamaicans to rise up against economic hardship at their expense (“and one people we forming ’cause the disparity alarming”). Her delivery is simultaneously cool and outraged, full of real pop presence. In the wake of huge success for Chronixx and Protoje, and with Rihanna supposedly releasing a reggae album this year, let the pop-reggae revival begin.In one ill-fated bedroom vignette, Jenny Lewis sketches the contours of an entire relationship: the couple forever falling apart who throw themselves into a full-throttle night that can only end badly. Lewis’s narrator is drunk and brazen, making herself vulnerable to someone who isn’t willing to reciprocate. “Don’t you wanna kiss me?” she pleads, wounded, then offended by her complacent lover: “Don’t you wanna even try and devour the moon?” Lunar symbolism is just one quality that aligns the first taste of Lewis’s fourth solo album with Stevie Nicks: the chiming piano, beautifully glassy cymbals (courtesy none other than Ringo Starr) and moody guitar stings situate it at the turn of the 80s, as the none-more-studio Tusk gave way to Nicks’ more intuitive Bella Donna, the tough arrangement giving Lewis’s helpless delivery real plight.This French-Algerian singer has been tiptoeing up to the big time for a couple of years thanks to her none-so-zeitgeisty sound: hazy, melancholy, spartan R\u0026ampB, with its edges reinforced with cold trap drums, a concoction by producer Stelios Phili (the man behind the blue-sky thinking of Elton John and Young Thug mashup High). She’s also got a co-write on HER’s Grammy’s nominated album, and pairs herself on Jade – her best track yet – with Dev Hynes’s rough-feather voice and subtle French whispering. “Baby you’re a feeling,” she sings of the faceless Jade, hymning the aftertouch left by a departed lover.We tipped her as one of our 50 artists to follow this year, after her hypnotically smooth and transportive sets have continued to wow the global techno cognoscenti – but we weren’t prepared for a track of this magnitude. The Japanese DJ-producer takes a huge leap forward with New Tribe, an instant classic that seems to slowly unfurl and turns to the sun. There is a huge amount of information here, with tens of multitracked elements being constantly added to: chirruping birds, ambient chords, electro basslines all join the insistent rhythm, and yet it never feels glutted.The 23-year-old NY rapper recently broke a very Gen Z record, scoring the lowest number of actual sales for a US No 1 album, instead reaching the top through tens of millions of streams. Many of them understandably went to this single, which has become a sleeper hit since its release in December. Twitter has been going wild for the surprisingly accomplished verse from pop-rap gremlin Tyga, who advocates laying diamonds on one’s penis as a kind of sexually exploitative and frankly impractical bait, but it’s A Boogie that really seals it with a maddeningly catchy chorus.Following the amicable departure of bassist Taylor Mulitz, DC trio Priests have embraced a more polished, synth-enhanced incarnation of their riotous post-punk sound on the first taste of their new album. What endures, though, is a knack for political commentary that’s both pin-sharp and fantastically surreal: The Seduction of Kansas (also the album title) concerns politicians’ fickle attempts to woo the swing state in US elections, with singer Katie Alice Greer promising: “I’m the one who loves you.” Despite acclaim for their previous album, Nothing Feels Natural, the band remain doggedly independent: they’re releasing the record on their own increasingly influential label, Sister Polygon, which also put out early releases by Rhode Island punks Downtown Boys and rising Maryland guitarist Snail Mail.There have been points in Little Simz’s quickly established catalogue where her obvious prowess has threatened to overshadow her musicality. Selfish – the first track from her forthcoming third album – gets both spot-on. It opens with Simz declaring, “I got a big ego”, but rather than ramming the point home, she floats confidently over a dreamy piano track from producer Inflo and a swooning vocal refrain from Cleo Sol. The pared-back production is the perfect foil for her aerobic and unyielding flow, which she uses to put a lover in their place and admonish someone for wasting their time on bitterness.Like father, like son. Rian Treanor’s dad is Mark Fell, the south Yorkshire producer whose genius is to take electronic sound as generic as supermarket paracetamol and, by putting it into off-kilter arrangements, make it as potent as peyote. Treanor uses the same trick: he created one of the dancefloor weapons of 2018 with his buckwild re-edit of Whigfield’s Saturday Night, and this first track from his debut album is similarly brilliant: malfunctioning speed garage based around a big melodic bassline and drum programming that just won’t sit still.You can’t move for songs about anxiety at the moment, most of which tend channel the low-key intimacy of hiding from the world under your duvet. More power to those songwriters, but it’s hard not to wish for more songs like In Your Head, in which Londoner Nilüfer Yanya precisely renders anxiety’s onslaught of second-guessing and frustration in majestic, grungy cascades of guitar. “I can think what I want  I can feel what I feel  Until you say it out loud  How will I know if it’s real?” she sings, spilling out the words in her gorgeous, bruised voice, then snatching them away with ripcord gasps. Despite Yanya’s chaotic theme, In Your Head is the picture of control: her sludgy guitar tapering off into elegant points, her voice incandescent and pleading amid the well deployed glinting synths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/051d6797765e8e6d8c42494dfce33b9ecfd83243/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8f8fadb1ad5af9125a90326d81faf162 1400w","title":"bonkers what the eu thinks of the malthouse compromise","story":"The plan has brought some Tory unity, but Brussels believes it is unworkableAt Westminster, it has the august name of the Malthouse compromise, after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who united two warring factions of the Tory party over the Brexit plan. In Brussels, it is known in less lofty terms. The “bonkers no-deal plan” is how one EU official described the compromise, reflecting a consensus that it is a non-starter. But why is the EU so opposed?The main aim of the plan is to take the sting out of the Irish backstop, the fallback arrangements to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The EU would be offered a choice between two variants of the current withdrawal agreement. Plan A involves extending the transition period to December 2021 and would ditch the backstop in favour of a basic free-trade agreement, using “proven solutions” to avoid border checks. Plan B is a managed no-deal that would extend the transition until December 2021 to give both sides time to prepare for the collapse of existing trade arrangements.For the EU, Brexit negotiations finished on 25 November 2018, when Theresa May and fellow EU leaders signed off the withdrawal agreement, the 585-page legal text painstakingly negotiated over 18 months. While May hopes to keep the Tory party together, the EU has many other priorities. Although the EU is open to redrafting the non-binding political declaration, should UK red lines change, it has repeatedly ruled out reopening the treaty. The prime minister’s decision to renege on the deal she made with EU leaders in November has exasperated officials and deepened mistrust.Some have speculated that the EU’s other 26 countries will abandon Ireland on the backstop, fearing a no-deal Brexit. So far, there is no sign of that happening. The EU, a peace project and an organisation composed of small countries, thinks it is vital to prioritise Ireland over a departing member state. But there is also self-interest. The EU wants to protect the integrity of its single market. The current alternative arrangements mooted at Westminster are seen as a threat to the internal market. Inadequate checks or lack of alignment between the UK and EU could mean that American chlorinated chickens, dangerous toys and all kinds of tariff-free products would start leaking into the European market via the backdoor of the Irish border.Even countries with strained relations with Brussels, such as Poland and Hungary, show no or limited appetite for helping the UK. Poland climbed down on a proposal for a time-limited backstop, while Hungary is in line with other member states. “The only way to deal with Brexit is to deal with it from a common standpoint,” Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács told journalists last week.Many Brexit supporters contend that the EU always comes up with a compromise at five minutes to midnight. So far, there is no sign that is happening, and there areno Brexit meetings planned between May and her EU counterparts.While the EU has come up with numerous post-negotiation fixes in the past, such as guarantees to secure Belgium’s ratification of the EU-Canada trade deal, or Irish ratification of the Lisbon treaty, these tend to be fine-tuning rather than reconstruction of the entire deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a76e104e6f94b56b1db86039c7ab36fc3756cf4c/0_86_2952_1771/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57707eeebca5e580fd45677d557bff1e","title":"brexiter mps unmoved by eu hint at legal assurance on backstop","story":"Cross-party group unable to tell EU official that MPs would back deal with added protocolA suggestion by one of the EU’s most powerful officials of possible further legal assurances on the Irish backstop has failed to win over Brexiter MPs, leading to heightened talk of the UK leaving the bloc with no deal.After a meeting with Martin Selmayr on Monday, the cross-party Brexit select committee emerged clear that the European commission secretary general had floated the possibility of a legally binding adjunct to the withdrawal agreement.However, Selmayr, a trusted aide of the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, tweeted that after the 90-minute discussions in Brussels that he was convinced “the EU did well to start its no-deal preparations in December 2017”.The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said Brussels appeared open to converting into legal text a letter of assurance published by Juncker and his European council counterpart, Donald Tusk, before the last Commons vote. That letter had offered swift trade negotiations and a rapid search for technological solutions to the Irish border issue to ensure the backstop would be temporarily, if ever, enforced.Stephen Crabb, a Conservative former work and pensions secretary, said: “We talked around the idea of the Tusk letter being written into some sort of legal protocol but every time someone asked him if it is something he could do, he said: ‘First of all, it’s not me negotiating, and secondly, let me turn around the question: if we were to do that would you be guaranteed to vote for the deal?’ That’s where some of the more Brexiteer members of the committee wouldn’t say.”Crabb added: “I’ve come away with the belief that they’re up for a discussion around some additional text or something that can bring comfort on this issue, but the idea that the backstop is going to go away is for the birds.”The leading Tory Brexiter and former cabinet minister, John Whittingdale, said Selmayr had asked “whether or not a letter which was legally binding might be sufficient. But I think we would need to see what that contains and to have an absolute assurance that it does gives us an exit.”However, as MPs gave their account of the meeting, Selmayr tweeted a clarification and issued a warning to Westminster.“On the EU side, nobody is considering this,” Selmayr said of a legal addition to the withdrawal agreement. “Asked whether any assurance would help to get the withdrawal agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were … inconclusive … The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no-deal preparations in December 2017.”Theresa May is due in Belfast on Tuesday before returning to Brussels for talks about her demands for a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement in an attempt to replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements”.Ireland’s deputy leader, Simon Coveney, said he was pleased the prime minister was going to try to reassure the people of Northern Ireland. However, he said, London had failed to offer any new ideas that stood up to scrutiny and MPs should read the Brexit deal before lining up to attack it.“What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking. And I think that’s a very unreasonable request to ask the Irish government to be flexible on,” Coveney said.During the meeting with Selmayr, Benn, a Labour former cabinet minister, had asked whether a long extension of the article 50 negotiating period could be used to discuss the future trade deal, in order to relegate the significance of the backstop.The EU has repeatedly insisted it cannot legally negotiate over trade with a country that is a member state.Benn told reporters outside the commission’s headquarters: “I put the point to him that in the political declaration … there is one very specific agreement which has been reached: there will be no tariffs … If you have so far been able to reach an agreement that both sides have said there will be no tariffs, then what in principle is to stop you doing the same with all the other issues to be negotiated?”Whittingdale said he had found Selmayr open to helping MPs find a majority in support of the Brexit deal, and that he had given the EU official a copy of the Malthouse compromise.The housing minister Kit Malthouse brokered talks between Brexiters and former remainers on a possible way out of the Brexit impasse.The resulting \u0027Malthouse compromise\u0027 involves redrafting the backstop arrangement for the Irish border which is so unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptic MPs and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up the government.It would also extend the transition period, set out under the previously negotiated withdrawal agreement, until the end of 2021. The extension is designed to give extra time to agree a new trading relationship.Under the plan, the backstop would be replaced with a free trade agreement with as yet unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border.If the attempt to renegotiate the backstop fails, the Malthouse compromise proposes what amounts to a managed no deal.The PM would ask the EU to honour the extended transition period, in return for agreeing the £39bn orce bill and its commitments on EU citizens’ rights. This would give both sides time to prepare for departure on WTO terms at the end of 2021 – or to negotiate a different deal.The compromise is backed by the DUP, the European Research Group of hard Brexiters, and former remainers including Nicky Morgan. It is this unlikely coalition that helped secure Commons backing for the Brady amendment, which pledged to replace the backstop with unspecified \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027.Before MPs voted for that amendment and against others, Theresa May praised the Malthouse compromise. She said these were \u0027serious proposals\u0027 and she would engage with them \u0027seriously and positively\u0027.“He said he had read some reports in the newspapers about it I don’t think he had seen the detail,” Whittingdale said of the proposal, which would extend the transition period to three years, cut the UK’s Brexit bill and rely on technological solutions as a backstop for avoiding a hard Irish border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45d339a14081262070d3bddbb54556c09d18ea8f/12_4_1902_1141/master/1902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e53d819d66e4642e17a11507cb47c90","title":"brexit what are carmaker contingency plans","story":"From stockpiling to Nissan’s U-turn on making new model in the UK, here’s what firms are doingUK-based ​carmakers have triggered a wave of Brexit contingency plans, with Nissan the latest manufacturer to warn that uncertainty around leaving the EU is “not helping” companies.The British car industry is a major exporter, with eight out of 10 cars sold abroad to markets including the EU, the US and China. The sector made more than 1.5m cars last year, although the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, revealed that investment by manufacturers almost halved in 2018 to £588.6m.A series of emergency Brexit measures – including stockpiling and bringing forward temporary factory closures – are expected to impose extra costs on a highly competitive industry. For instance, Jaguar Land Rover, which owns multiple sites in the ​West Midlands, is stockpiling parts and Honda plans to halt production at its Swindon plant for six days after Brexit day on 29 March.Car manufacturing is a flagship industry in the UK, having staged a remarkable recovery since the 1970s. A host of major international firms have sites in the UK, ranging from Nissan and Toyota to BMW and Volkswagen, with JLR playing a central role as the largest employer in the sector.The concern among industry executives is that a disorderly Brexit would throw finely tuned supply lines into chaos by disrupting Britain’s import and export markets. ​For multinational companies with little to tie them to the UK, that could make investing elsewhere the safer option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598b1af10645f6c3b1070fc68d4f6f2fc367089f/0_235_7123_4275/master/7123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d98a22e40bc3aa28646b0ee38dbfbc","title":"government letter to nissan reveals brexit promise to carmarkers","story":"Business secretary vowed to maintain manufacturers’ capacity to trade with EUThe business secretary promised Nissan in 2016 that it would not be “adversely affected” by Brexit, in a confidential letter released after the carmaker abandoned plans to produce a new model in Sunderland.Greg Clark told Nissan’s then chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, that the UK government would do “everything we can” to help, and promised a previously undisclosed package of financial support worth £61m contingent on manufacturing the X-Trail in the UK.“The government fully recognises the significance of the EU market to your presence in Sunderland,” Clark wrote in the four-page letter dated October 2016.“It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK’s future relationship with the EU.”Clark’s promise cannot be met because no Brexit deal has been struck with the European Union, and the government has not ruled out leaving without a deal on 29 March.The letter did not make any specific assurances about the UK’s future Brexit policy, although it did seek to provide general comfort to Ghosn. It acknowledges his concern about the impact of changes in the terms of trade.“We will continue to do everything we can to make it as easy and rewarding as possible for Nissan to invest,” Clark wrote at the time.“I understand, of course, your worries now about uncertainties as the UK prepares to leave the EU. In particular, your fear that potential future trade arrangements could affect the business case for your investments.”Over the weekend, Nissan said it would no longer manufacture the new model X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, stopping a planned expansion. The company said “the continued uncertainty” over Brexit was one of the factors behind its decision.The letter, which the government had repeatedly refused to release, promised financial support towards Nissan’s investments at the site in return for the expansion of production.The grants are worth £61m and were finally made on June 2018, Clark said in a second letter sent on Monday to Rachel Reeves, the chairman of the business select committee, in which he formally disclosed the correspondence.Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, complained that MPs had not be told that Nissan had been offered financial support. She asked why her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, had not been told about the package when had what assurances had been provided to Nissan in 2016.Morgan said: “If the government provided financial assistance to Nissan to persuade it to stay in Sunderland, it should set out what this support was, and why it did not disclose it to my predecessor.”Clark is understood to be unhappy with reports on Monday morning that the package could be scrapped, as he does not want to further antagonise Nissan, according to sources at the Department for Business.The minister has repeatedly warned of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, and wants the government to rule it out soon if parliament cannot agree on a deal with the European Union.Nissan said in a statement that the letter showed both the company’s and the government’s “continued desire to support investment in the UK and maintain Sunderland as one of Nissan’s manufacturing hubs in Europe. The letter is no longer commercially sensitive as it contains nothing that hasn’t been disclosed publicly before, and the projects referenced in the letter have now changed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa3f851daf24bd72401619f2d404fb5adca8040/0_52_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1584a216ec3c3bbbf5b405e3d3ed0618","title":"tory mps back rightwing youth group turning point uk","story":"Rees-Mogg and Patel support UK branch of Turning Point, accused of anti-Islam viewsA number of Conservative MPs have praised the work of a new UK rightwing youth pressure group that is said to have links to far-right conspiracy theorists, and has in the US been accused of anti-Islam views and connections to racism.On Sunday, MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel tweeted supportive messages for Turning Point UK, the offshoot of a controversial organisation established in the US.The UK outpost is headed by George Farmer, a Conservative donor and son of a Tory peer, who has been pictured (below second left) socialising with Paul Joseph Watson (second right), a senior editor at the far-right conspiracy theory website Infowars, and frequently retweets him.

Asking for a friend.”The newly launched Turning Point UK – which has no connection to the long-established UK addiction  charity Turning Point, which helps people with addiction and other issues – says it aims to challenge the idea that young people are inherently left-leaning, and seeks to fight against “socialism, racism and identity politics”, among other issues.Several Conservative MPs have approvingly retweeted the group’s initial message. “This could be huge,” said Steve Baker. Patel, a former international development secretary, said: “A new generation standing up for political \u0026amp economic freedoms \u0026amp Conservative values \u0026amp beliefs. Fantastic!”Another MP, Bernard Jenkin, said: “This is the future” while Rees-Mogg said: “The left has no monopoly on the ‘young’.”Among other people to praise the establishment of Turning Point UK was For Britain, the anti-Islam party set up by the former Ukip leadership contender Anne Marie Waters, which said it hoped to support the group.Turning Point UK is a spin-off from a US youth campaign that advocates free markets and small government, loudly supporting Donald Trump and campaigning on free speech issues.The latter topic has seen Turning Point USA set up a website called Professor Watchlist. This is billed as a way to stop academics from discriminating against Trump-supporting students but has been criticised as intimidating.Turning Point USA vehemently insists it is inclusive, but has prompted concern about alleged links to racists, and anti-Islam messages.Farmer, whose father is Michael Farmer, a multimillionaire financier and longtime Tory donor, has also given money to the party, and attended fundraising events.He is engaged to Candace Owens, a Trump-supporting US YouTube commentator and TV pundit.

Subsequently that got revised down to £61m. (See 3.45pm.)But at the time Downing Street denied offering the company a special deal. Here is an extract from the story my colleague Rowena Mason wrote in October 2016.No 10 is refusing to disclose what state support has been given to Nissan to convince the car manufacturer to boost production at its Sunderland plant despite its worries about Brexit. Downing Street insisted there was no “sweetheart deal” with the Japanese company, but acknowledged that Theresa May had given some assurances to the wider industry that it would be protected from the impact of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU ...No 10 refused to say what has been promised to the car industry or to say whether any public money was involved, although it signalled that it had not made any declaration to the EU about a proposal to offer state aid. “The assurances are that we will get the best possible deal from leaving the EU,” May’s deputy official spokesman said. “There was no special deal for Nissan.”Thanks to ID499187 in the comments for prompting this line of enquiry.No doubt Greg Clark, the business secretary, will be pressed on this when he makes his Commons statement, probably at around 5pm.In 2016 the Commons Treasury committee, which was then chaired by the Conservative Andrew Tyrie, repeatedly tried to find out from the government whether the Greg Clark letter to Nissan, which at that point was confidential, contained any financial promises. The government repeatedly refused to say.(At the time there was speculation that there might have been a promise to ensure Nissan would not lose out if the UK left the customs union, leading to a loss in exports.)In a letter to Clark, Nicky Morgan, the current chair of the committee, has asked why the £61m eventually offered to Nissan (see 3.45pm) was not disclosed at the time. She also calls for the publication of the full text of the letter, although that request is now redundant because the business department were publishing the text around the time Morgan was releasing her letter.Greg Clark, the business secretary, has released his letter to Nissan (pdf) partly in response to a long-standing request from the Commons business committee. He has published it today alongside a letter to Rachel Reeves, the committee chair.In his letter to Nissan in October 2016 Clark promised the company “a package of support in areas such as skills, R\u0026ampD and innovation” worth up to £80m. That was contingent on the Qashqai and the X-Trail being built at Sunderland.But in his letter to Reeves Clark says that the company was actually offered £61m in June 2018.The original link to the Greg Clark Nissan letter that I posted at 3.15pm was faulty, but I have now fixed it.Here is the full quote from Angela Merkel on Brexit today. (See 1.38pm.) She was speaking on a visit to Tokyo.We want to do everything to ensure that a no deal doesn’t happen, because that would only heighten insecurity. We’re happy that a majority in the British parliament feels the same. Now we have to figure out what to do. We’re saying that the exit treaty took a long time to negotiate, so we don’t want to re-open the exit treaty. That’s not on the agenda. But we’re still discussing the future mechanism. And in the future relationship, you can also address issues that are still being discussed - for example with the management of the border between Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK, and the Republic of Ireland and by extension the European Union.There are certainly possibilities to resolve this point - that is, guaranteeing the integrity of the single market, the unity of the single market, even if Northern Ireland isn’t part of that, and on the other hand the desire to have as far as possible no controls at the Irish border. You have to be creative and listen to each other - such discussions can and must take place. We can now use the time to reach an agreement where beforehand agreement wasn’t possible, if there’s enough good will. But we have to hear from the UK - this is the decisive point - how they view this.The business department has now published the full text (pdf) of the letter that Greg Clark, the business secretary, sent to Nissan in 2016 promising financial support in return for the X-Trail being built at Sunderland.Here is Jeremy Cliffe, the Economist’s Charelemagne columnist, on the Martin Selmayr tweet quoted earlier. (See 1.26pm.)In 2016, after the Brexit vote, Nissan announced that it would be building Qashqai and X-Trail models at its factory in Sunderland. At the time it was revealed that the company had received assurances from the government, in the form of a letter from Greg Clark, the business secretary, but the precise nature of those assurances was never revealed because the letter was not published.The Nissan announcement at the weekend reversed part of what was promised by the company in 2016.And the Financial Times has now got hold of the Clark letter. As Peter Campbell reports (paywall), the government promised Nissan that its operations would not be “adversely affected” by Brexit.The government also promised the firm £80m towards investment at the site, but the letter said that money was “contingent too on a positive decision by the Nissan board to allocate production of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant”, the FT reports.The government made no specific promise on the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU — such as remaining in the bloc’s customs union — but vowed to protect car manufacturers in the UK. They would be a “critical priority of our negotiations” with the EU, the letter said.  “The government fully recognises the significance of the EU markets to your presence in Sunderland,” the letter stated. “It will be a critical priority of our negotiations to support UK car manufacturers, and ensure their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK’s future relationship with the EU.”On the World at One John Whittingdale, the Brexiter former culture secretary and a member of the Commons Brexit committee, said that after the committee met Martin Selmayr, the European commission’s secretary general, he came away with the impression that the PM woud not secure meaningful change to the Brexit deal. He explained:Selmaryr told us what we have heard from others in the commission, that basically they regard the deal as having been finalised ... and they don’t wish to reopen it.They did say that the political declaration is open for discussion in the future. But they said that they could not reopen the withdrawal agreement. They did talk about legal assurances, in the form of the letter that we have already had from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk. I have to say that, for those of us who couldn’t support the withdrawal agreement, I certainly didn’t hear anything that gave me great hope that the prime minister would come back with a change to the withdrawal agreement. Whittingdale also said that he gave Selmayr a copy of the so-called Malthouse compromise and told him he thought it was the one version of the deal that might get through the Commons. Asked how Selmayr responded, Whittingdale said: “He is still of a view that the deal has been done and it is now up to the British parliament to ratify it.”Whittingdale also said Selmayr was sceptical about extending article 50 if it was not clear what purpose extension would serve. He said:Whittingdale also said that the committee met Selmayr because, although Michel Barnier was the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, if the deal that Barnier negotiated fell through, Selmayr would then become the key person to deal with.But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has said that “with creativity” a solution to the backstop problem could still be found.This is from Martin Selmayr, the European commission’s secretary general.Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, has welcomed Labour’s commitment to the backstop. (See 1.11pm.) Speaking after meeting Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, at the Europa Hotel in Belfast, O’Neill said: It was important today to put to Keir Starmer that we need to see clarity from the Labour party on the backstop. He did say in the meeting that the backstop is inevitable and that is the Labour position. It’s their position because they understand the need to ensure there’s no hard border on this island.O’Neill said that it was important to hear from Starmer on this because in the past Labour had not been clear and consistent on the backstop. The party has argued in the past that there would be no need for one under its plan for Brexit because it would keep the UK in the customs union (even though that alone would not obviate the need for the backstop if Northern Ireland were outside the single market). O’Neill said:And Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has also said that attempts to find an alternative to the backstop will fail. Speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, he said:The prime minister and her team have spent over 12 months trying to find an alternative to the backstop. We have only got the backstop because they couldn’t find an alternative. So, for her to go back now saying ‘I don’t want the backstop, I want an alternative’ is to stand the last 12 months on its head. And I think that’s what is causing the anxiety because nobody realistically thinks she’s going to succeed in that objective.Starmer also said that Labour had “concerns” about the backstop, but that it accepted there had to be one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dcafde00c33cb691ff093b5661fc4e72c25227e/21_201_4304_2583/master/4304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=309e9a2f22ace43fe0b8ff1a7ac2f143","title":"england five point plan recovery","story":"Changes are needed in the wake of England’s defeats in the Caribbean, but this is not the time for knee-jerk reactionsEngland have won eight of their past 11 Tests. They have also won eight of their past 19. They are not as good as they thought they were after victory in Sri Lanka they are not as bad as we think they are now. By demanding an instant fix to a complicated problem, many modern fans are demonstrating the same aversion to nuance and patience that they deplore in England’s batsmen. It’s important not to overreact, but nor should England under-react. Their top-order batting was in crisis even when they were hammering India and Sri Lanka last year, and all ideas should be discussed in an attempt to address it. Those ideas should all stay on the table until after the World Cup, England’s biggest priority this year, and the Ashes, which they should still win if the pitches are slow seamers. This summer will be the end of two important cycles, and of Trevor Bayliss’s time as coach. Then, not now, is the time to make major changes.The idea of Jonny Bairstow as a punishing No 3 was seductive but early evidence suggests it was also fanciful, and that he will always be too loose for such an important role. England have modified the old Australian way of picking the best XI and then the captain their version is to pick the best XI and then the batting order. It might now be beneficial to treat the top three as a separate, specialised team, with at least one and ideally two defensive batsmen, and people who bat in those positions for their counties. It shouldn’t matter if they are 30-something stopgaps such as David Steele in 1975. England don’t need another all-action hero they need a bank clerk who can go to war. Picking a new No 3 would mean omitting a big name – or Ben Foakes, whose low profile and unquantifiable excellence leave him at risk of becoming a patsy – but on recent form no batsman in the side is undroppable. There are echoes of Sven-Goran Eriksson’s star-studded yet unbalanced England football team, which was so much less than the sum of its parts. As the former England spinner Robert Croft said on the BBC at the weekend, there is no point having a group of batsmen who are devastating at 220 for three if they are always coming in at 20 for three. One of the reasons England are at sixes and sevens so often is that they have too many sixes and sevens.In the first year of his captaincy, Root reached 50 in 14 out of 25 innings. Since then he has done so in four innings out of 2232 –\u0026nbspEngland have lost a wicket every 32 balls in the series they have taken a West Indies wicket every 78 balls.25 –\u0026nbspTimes England have been dismissed in less than 90 overs (ie a full day’s play) under Joe Root.29.52\u0026nbsp –\u0026nbspEngland’s average runs per wicket under Joe Root, the lowest under any captain since Alec Stewart in the 1990s. Only one man has captained England in at least 20 Tests with a figure lower than that of Root’s team – Archie MacLaren from 1897 to 1909.When Michael Vaughan succeeded Nasser Hussain in 2003, England lost a world-class batsman and gained something even more precious: a world-class captain whose leadership was the single most important factor in England’s 2005 Ashes victory. The trade has not been quite so successful with Joe Root. England have swapped a world-class batsman for a good batsman and at best a decent captain. Root is averaging 42 as captain, as against 53 when he got the job, and in the past 12 months that average has dropped to 33. This is not to say he should be sacked as a knee-jerk reaction to two defeats. But nor should he be immune, especially if England lose the Ashes in the summer. There’s a strong argument that they would be a better side with Root averaging over 50, ideally at No 3, and somebody else in charge. The number of all‑rounders gives England the luxury of considering all options, however leftfield or risky, and that includes a specialist captain like Eoin Morgan. It would do serious damage to Root’s ego to become the first England captain to be sacked because of Test results since David Gower in 1989, but the ECB is not running a wellness centre. In the last couple of years, there has been too much treading on eggshells, and from afar it feels like merit has not always been the only consideration.It’s still hard to fathom the decline of Haseeb Hameed, whose performances in India in 2016-17 were so precocious that Trevor Bayliss said the dressing room was “in awe” of him. Hameed’s coach in his breakthrough season at Lancashire was Ashley Giles, England’s new director of cricket and whose return to Warwickshire coincided with Hameed’s baffling slump. One of the first things in Giles’s in-tray should be to meet Hameed and try to understand why his form has collapsed, and to ensure he doesn’t feel like he has been cast adrift. All ideas, no matter how leftfield, should be discussed: a loan move, batting down the order, giving up all white-ball cricket, the England Lions captaincy, a personal batting coach such as Ricky Ponting. Whatever it takes, whatever it costs Hameed is worth it. He has the most potential of any young batsman in England, even if that potential now feels as fragile as his little finger, and is the kind of defensive batsman England desperately need. There is no rush when he bats and there should be no rush in his rehabilitation. Even if he did not return to international cricket until 2021, he would still be just 24 years old – an age at which many people haven’t started their first Test career, never mind their second.This one is simple, at least in theory: play the majority of county cricket in June, July and August so that batsmen have the opportunity to play longer innings on truer wickets. In reality, the schedule is geared towards white-ball cricket for the foreseeable future, and the England and Wales Cricket Board has a tough job finding a way for The Hundred and the Test hundred to coexist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19cf922151d9a834ba2d1312d072900b67ba21af/0_65_3043_1826/master/3043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c58e3356797d92ad72006875670b23b","title":"england need to be physical and adaptable to realise a winning formula","story":"Adopting a strategy of squeeze and strangle, Eddie Jones’ team gave Ireland little room to handle the constant pressureThere was so much to like about England’s performance in Dublin but of the things that impressed me most, the way they handled the breakdown is right up there. Twelve months ago it was such a problematic area of their game but on Saturday’s evidence it is becoming a strength. They haven’t reinvented the wheel but the biggest improvement is their decision-making.Led by Tom Curry at openside, they showed an adaptability that Ireland did not. Adaptable in the sense that they were much more alert to how Jérôme Garcès was refereeing the breakdown and responded accordingly. Yes, the breakdown was a bit of a free-for-all, there were plenty of occasions when you thought the whistle might blow a lot earlier, but England adjusted best.Curry was just brilliant at that, Billy Vunipola as well. The key difference is that they are picking and choosing which rucks to go into, they are not just flying in for the sake of it. I’m seeing a lot of communication in and around the ruck – I’m hearing a lot of “dead” calls. What I mean by that is when they go in and the second attacker is there and there is no way they can turn the ball over the call comes in – “dead” – and England’s defenders are straight out and back in the line.With more numbers on their feet in the defensive line, all of a sudden you can make those dominant tackles that we saw from England, you can make those two-man hits. The attacker wants to isolate defenders one on one – if he is getting hit by two tackles, he’s losing the contest and it then makes it much easier for England to get over the ball. I saw that a lot, especially in the wide rucks where there were Jonny May – who I thought was man of the match – Jack Nowell, Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade all making an impact.The interesting thing is whether they can show the same adaptability against France. It is a different referee, Nigel Owens, who will have his own way of policing the breakdown. At the World Cup you have to deal with a lot of different referees and interpretations so it is critical for England that they show the same clever decision-making in the next match.The two other aspects that really caught my eye were the suffocating defence which knocked Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray out of their stride, and the off-the-ball work. The kick chase was excellent – May’s work-ethic to chase, contest, go back and do it all again was fantastic. Then, when Ireland had the ball, the ruck pressure put on by Mako Vunipola and Kyle Sinckler, or the pressure Maro Itoje and Courtney Lawes put on Murray, meant that his kicks weren’t as accurate as they usually are. England did not create a lot from phase play but that was not the game plan. It was to squeeze and strangle, and they did that.But it is not just the breakdown they have to back up against France. This was the best 80-minute performance they have delivered under Eddie Jones and perhaps they have to accept that they may not have the same kind of accuracy. Maybe they are not quite going to be that resolute throughout, perhaps the lineout will not be quite as good, but what they have to do is bring that kind of physicality. What I really want to see from England is two or three matches, back to back, with that physicality. It should become non-negotiable.At World Cups you cannot afford to have one good game and then one bad game. It can cost you the pool, it can cost you a semi-final. The All Blacks are the best in the world because they stay at their top level, or if they don’t then just slightly below.What England will have to understand is that it is very hard to replicate a big emotional performance week after week. We used to talk about it a lot when I played for the All Blacks. Games like that take so much out of you physically, mentally and emotionally, and it will now be a short turnaround for England to get themselves back up. They don’t have the two weeks to prepare like they did for Ireland. They’ve got to debrief, reboot and fill the players with information.How can you do it? You can mix up training, you can lower the intensity of things, limit the amount of info they get so it’s very specific or you can make changes. Bring fresh guys in so they pick up the level of physicality and intensity and that carries the rest through. It will be a big test, you look for consistency – it’s the holy grail in sport. Does Eddie make changes? He probably won’t want to after a performance like that, but in specific areas it can be a benefit after an emotional game.England will look at that France performance against Wales and know that if they can start as fast as they did against Ireland, then they will be out of sight. I imagine all week they’ll be talking about starting fast, forcing them to kick and then they can use the power game to break France down. The French have a massive pack but I could not believe the Jekyll and Hyde nature of the their performance on Friday. It looked like they went in at half-time and swapped with a school side. That’s what pressure does, so England will look to turn the screw.• Nick Evans won 16 New Zealand caps and is Harlequins’ attack coach"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/975b4e07091838b2bed3a7814cf630e8aa549bce/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7726de09b3eaf7cf9883cda0fcbceb68","title":"talking horses weather eases as taunton action leads off the week","story":"The Gold Cup and King George winners are among 10 entries for Saturday’s Denman Chase at NewburyGold Cup hero Native River and King George winner Clan Des Obeaux are among 10 entries for Saturday’s Betfair Denman Chase at Newbury.Colin Tizzard’s Native River is looking for a third successive win in the race but has plenty of ground to make up on Paul Nicholls’ Clan Des Obeaux, who finished over 13 lengths in front of him when bursting on to the big-race scene at Kempton on Boxing Day. “At Kempton he jumped out to the left. That’s twice he has been there, and he hasn’t been at ease,” said Tizzard. “He stayed on well at Kempton – that’s all we can take out of the race. I think he is almost unbeaten at Newbury, so this was always going to be our prep race. I think the King George winner is going there as well. But this is our prep race for the Gold Cup. “I think the course at Newbury will suit him better. He is a strong stayer and he has very good form round Newbury. We will see what the entries are like. If they have the forecast rain and it’s good to soft, he’ll be there.” Nicholls, of course, trained Denman – winner of the 2008 edition of this Grade Two event, and it has carried his name since 2012. Nicholls’ most recent success came a year later with Silviniaco Conti. Coneygree, winner of the Gold Cup in 2015, has been entered by Mark and Sara Bradstock. He picked up another minor injury when unseating in the King George. Leopardstown’s loss on Sunday could potentially be Newbury’s gain, with two who were supposed to run in the Irish Gold Cup but pulled out because of the ground now in the mix. Tony Martin’s Gold Cup third Anibale Fly and Gordon Elliott’s Noble Endeavor could make the journey over. Nicky Henderson has entered Beware The Bear, following his good win last time out, and Gold Present. Nigel Twiston-Davies’s Ballyhill, Tom Lacey’s Thomas Patrick and Harry Fry’s The Last Samuri complete the 10. Press AssociationThe worst of the wintry weather seems to have eased for the moment at least, and while Monday’s scheduled card at Carlisle was abandoned on Sunday morning, rain has washed away the snow at Taunton and a seven-race card will go ahead as planned after a 7.30am GMT inspection. It was “never in doubt”, according to the track’s Twitter feed at any rate.Three of the seven races currently have an odds-on favourite but there are some competitive contests elsewhere on the card including a handicap hurdle as the getting-out race which will set off “bad each-way” alerts across the betting industry if the current 16 runners all go to post.Silver Quay (4.45) might look a little short at around 9-4 given the numbers but there is not much depth to the contest and he was a convincing winner of a similar race over course and distance last time out. Having Bryony Frost on your side aboard her father Jimmy’s runner is also a big plus.Touch Kick (4.15) is another course winner, albeit over hurdles, and won his seasonal debut at Hereford in November off a mark just 2lb lower than here. He could find a little more improvement for this step up to three miles.A £19,000 conditions event is the feature event on the all-weather card at Wolverhampton and Oh This Is Us (5.55) could be up to giving away 3lb to his field. Richard Hannon’s runner has not been to the track since a sub-par run in Italy in October but he won after a similar break last February and Ryan Moore’s booking looks significant.Prerogative (6.25) and Hanakotoba (7.55) should both go well on the same card while Billyoakes (3.30) could be overpriced for the sprint handicap at Chelmsford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d18f274f85f210ec53eed28ca3df0372649dd45/0_0_2642_1761/master/2642.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=056e85090d33383eaff1f061406f7f7c 720w","title":"picture clue cops turn to amateur web sleuths to help crack cases","story":"Europol gets thousands of tips after appealing to public to identify crime scene imagesIt looks like a normal bathroom tile. But when amateur internet sleuths managed to locate it, they found the missing piece in an international child abuse investigation.This was one of the clues that led to the arrest of a suspect and the identification of nine child abuse victims.There’s nothing new about the police asking for tips – think missing person posters or episodes of Crimewatch. But the Trace an Object crowdsourcing effort launched by Europol in 2017 asks iniduals and collectives to find clues for unsolved child abuse investigations by identifying parts of digital images.It could be a slice of cheese that someone recognises as Belgian, a crumpled shopping bag or a brightly coloured child’s duvet cover: it just needs a moment of recognition – human or digital – to fill in the gaps that lead police to a suspect or a victim.The pictures Europol posts online are drawn from a grim stash of 30m images of child sexual exploitation, which are often circulating on the dark web. Steven Wilson, the head of the agency’s European cybercrime centre, said that some are linked to crimes happening now and others document abuse from decades ago.Wilson said: “In the cases we deal with here, we have done as much as we can with law enforcement and this is a final throw of the dice.“In most cases, we are trying to identify a location and the eyes of the world can look at something that you can’t possibly replicate, even by online analysis. If we can narrow it down to one country or an area, that’s a massive starting point.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be miserable – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe response has stunned investigators: 283 posted images have led to 22,000 emails. Investigative groups such as Bellingcat have set up a Check platform to organise the workflow, and a Reddit community has also got stuck in.“Bellingcat has done a huge amount of investigative work,” added Wilson. “We reached out to them and they have passed on some of their technical expertise to do particular things … We can’t stay doing the things we have been doing for many years because we’ll only get the same results – we have to try new ideas.”This pilot has been adopted as a longer-term initiative at Europol, which passes confirmed tips to local police forces to help get victims to safety and start the prosecution process.For one Europol officer, who has spent months studying unedited images of child abuse to build up leads, it is a eureka moment when a crowdsourced tip leads to an arrest. “It feels awesome,” said the officer, who did not want to be identified. “It’s an extremely motivating element for doing the job.”The officer works in an imposing building in The Hague, where the revolving security door is labelled a “tourniquet” and there is compulsory counselling to help process the effects of such work.Elsewhere in the Netherlands lives Bo, a moderator of the amateur investigative group Serendip. Bo, who would only be interviewed by email and would not give out any personal details, guides a team of 15 people who recently helped identify a rooftop in China for Europol.“We are pretty sure that we have found 40 images,” Bo wrote. “Europol doesn’t really ever reply. Sometimes it puts a ‘like’ on Twitter. That’s a shame. We mostly find the things they ask for quickly but we often don’t know what happens next.”Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, explains that people such as Bo use “weirdly basic” open-source techniques to reverse-search images on publicly shared archives. They look for clues related to lighting conditions or a season to identify a location.Higgins said: “Sometimes it’s just a matter of recognising shopping bag brands. Some of it’s more obscure. There was a photo taken of a hotel, which showed a whole room with two figures blurred out. Very rapidly someone said that they had been there, and it was in Mauritius. When we went to the website of the hotel, they had a photo that was the exact same angle, of a room that was almost identical. That just relies on someone seeing the tweet who knows what it is.”People may sometimes identify more than a simple item, Higgins added. “Sometimes we can find the images of the victims, clearly from the same photo set. There’s at least one case where it was possible to identify a likely suspect as well. That has big issues if that gets out in public and people decide to start tracking these people down themselves.”This also could alert a suspect to destroy potential evidence, said Bo.Getting amateurs involved in police work does have risks, according to Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius, a law professor at Radboud University Nijmegen and a fellow at the University of Amsterdam’s institute of information law.Borgesius said: “Criminal law contains rules that limit police power, to protect iniduals suspected of some kind of crime against the state. We can generally assume the police force is trained on those rules: even though you are investigating crime, there are limits to what you can do. I’m afraid crowds don’t always know those rules and might become overly enthusiastic in their own online echo chamber.“In an extreme case, you could think there’s a risk of a lynch mob.”These are all hazards Europol takes seriously. “You have got to balance that risk with the huge potential,” said Wilson.“For the nine victims identified so far, this potentially has made a significant difference to their lives. On many occasions, people perpetrating this abuse are repeat offenders and if you can stop them, for me the most important thing is what future damage is prevented.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The US decision to reimpose sanctions lifted under former president Barack Obama, as well as new measures targeting Iran’s oil, banking and shipping industries has left Baghdad caught in the middle of growing tensions between its two biggest allies.In an interview with CBS aired on Sunday evening Trump said Iraq was “perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up,” adding that Iran was a “real problem”.“We’re going to keep watching and we’re going to keep seeing and if there’s trouble,” he said. “If somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we’re going to know it before they do.”The fortune the US spent on the Ayn al-Assad airbase west of Ramadi must be used effectively and US troops must stay in the region to protect Israel, the president continued.Hassan Karim al-Kaabi, Iraq’s deputy speaker of parliament, said Trump’s latest comments were a “blatant and overt violation of sovereignty and national will”, according to local media.Trump also angered Iraqi politicians in December after a three-hour visit to troops at Ayn al-Assad on Christmas Day, which did not include meetings with the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, or any other officials.The US is reportedly in negotiations with Baghdad over redeploying some of the 2,000 special forces currently stationed in north-east Syria to American bases in Iraq, following Trump’s surprise decision last December to withdraw from the country.US troops in Kurdish-held Syria – deployed in the fight against Isis – have also acted as a buffer between US-allied Kurdish militias and neighbouring Turkey - which has threatened a full-scale military offensive to dismantle Kurdish groups it says are a terrorist threat.Many analysts believe the decision will serve to strengthen Iran’s presence in Syria, allowing Tehran greater access to oilfields in the north-east and unchecked freedom of movement for Iranian-backed forces in the border region with Iraq."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Mr Hogan said the EU was “ready for all eventualities” should Irish farmers suffer a collapse in food prices in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of March. The Irish commissioner said past crises in the EU agri-sector, including the 2014 Russia ban on EU food imports, means that Brussels has “tools available that we are able to put into effect fairly quickly”.The Government and the EU have held talks at political and official level on a package of compensation to support farmers should they suffer heavy UK tariffs and plummeting prices, in particular on beef, in a hard Brexit. Half of all Irish beef exports end up in the UK, leaving the industry with what Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed described as an “existential challenge” should it face an estimated €700 million in tariffs. Overall, Mr Creed estimated that the agri-food sector faced €1.7 billion in tariffs in a no-deal scenario.Mr Hogan declined to discuss the size of any potential EU package of financial supports. “You don’t know what scale you are talking about until we see the outcome, whether it is going to be a soft or hard Brexit, so we can’t jump to conclusions otherwise we might distort the market unintentionally,” he told The .The Irish Farmers Association warned that a no-deal Brexit would be a “wipeout” for farmers in a no-deal scenario as they would face price falls of more than 25 per cent that would put up to 70,000 beef farmers out of business. “Everybody is satisfied that the tools available are sufficient to deal with any exceptional circumstances that might arise,” said Mr Hogan.In addition to loosening state aid rules the EU could provide exceptional aid under the same common agricultural market rules that Brussels funnelled hundreds of millions of euro to farmers in the Baltic states and other EU states affected by the Russia ban in response to sanctions over its annexation of Crimea.Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton said discussions were ongoing with the commission on what might happen in a hard Brexit, including any logistical supports that would be needed. He did not comment on indications his climate change plan would be postponed as a consequence of a no-deal Brexit, especially because of its implications for farmers, but he insisted on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics that Brexit would not be the latest excuse to hold off on climate action such as carbon tax.Mr Bruton said the deadline for his whole-of-government plan was the end of March, and setting a trajectory of rising carbon taxes would be part of the plan. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, reacting to an  report on Saturday that the Government plan might be postponed in a hard Brexit, said delaying climate change “doesn’t make sense” as the plan could help farmers ersify away from an over-reliance on the UK beef and dairy export market. “If anything you would want to ramp up your protections for agriculture by ersifying away from these large commodity markets,” he said. Mr Bruton confirmed that the State was facing €5 billion in fines for not delivering on its climate commitments based on current “business-as-usual” projections out to 2030. He said this threat required cuts in emissions in every sector, including agriculture. Separately, the State is facing recurring compliance costs of up to €300 million a year for failing to miss 2020 targets on renewable and carbon emissions reductions.The only concession the EU has granted up to now is on how some Irish emissions will be calculated in the future, which will make future targets less onerous, but current emissions are rising in key sectors, and fall well short of meeting even the less onerous targets.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: CollinsThe Workplace Relations Commission has invited nursing unions and public service management to new talks in an attempt to avert further strikes by nurses and midwives scheduled for the days ahead.The HSE believes that about 50,000 people will be affected by the strike by nurses scheduled to take place on Tuesday.This is effectively double the number impacted directly by the previous work stoppage by nurses last Wednesday. As part of an escalation of the dispute, the strike on Tuesday will affect people with appointments for rehabilitation and respite services. Appointments for hospital in-patient operations, day case procedures and out-patient clinics will, with some exceptions, be cancelled for Tuesday.Nurses are also scheduled to stage another 24-hour work stoppage on Thursday.Meanwhile psychiatric nurses are to escalate their campaign of industrial action later this week, it has been announced. The Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) said an overtime ban, which was scheduled to be in place for 12 hours on Wednesday and Thursday, will now run through the full day.A 12-hour overtime ban will be in force on Tuesday.A spokesman for the PNA said he escalation of the industrial action would confirm “the absolute reliance of the mental health services in overtime, as well as the level of under-staffing”. Child and adolescent mental health services will be exempted from the industrial action.The PNA is also due to hold three consecutive days of strike action on February 12, 13 and 14 February at the same time as Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. Elsewhere, emergency department doctors have warned that patients could deteriorate and even die during the nurses’ strike unless arrangements are made to promptly identify those most at risk on arrival at hospital.With members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) set to stage two further one-day strikes this week, emergency department doctors say their concerns are growing over the lack of adequate triage arrangements for patients presenting during the strike.The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine says hospital emergency departments risk becoming “battlegrounds” during the dispute because of the difficulties in deciding which patients get prioritised.The association’s president, Dr Emily O’Conor, repeated a call for the nursing union to grant a derogation to emergency departments during its industrial action. Failing that, she said the HSE needed to put in place a clear and properly-resourced alternative plan.The standard triage procedure operated in Irish hospitals, which is computer based, is entirely delivered by nurses, but during last week’s strike this function was provided manually by senior doctors in most hospitals.The INMO said its members were not providing triage during the strikes “as a matter of course”, but that last week nurses at two sites provided cover due to a surge in patient demand or emergency issues.The HSE said it was continuing to engage with the INMO to put in place arrangements for the safe provision of services in advance of Tuesday’s strike.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Sunday rejected calls for an independent review of the striking nurses’ pay claim, but said the Government does not intend to withhold payments due to them under public sector pay agreements.Mr Varadkar said he regretted the enormous inconvenience to patients caused by the strike. Even if the next one-day strike was to be called off, it would be too late to reverse the cancellation of thousands of patients’ appointments and procedures.Following a 24-hour stoppage last week almost 40,000 INMO members plan to hold one-day strikes on Tuesday and Thursday.The HSE said it expected all hospital outpatient, inpatient and day-surgery appointments scheduled for Tuesday to be cancelled.More than 50,000 patients will be affected by this week’s industrial action.Members of the INMO are also planning work stoppages for three days the following week, on February 12th, 13th and 14th. On Saturday the union announced two extra days of strike action on February 19th and 21st.It is also increasing the number of nursing services on strike from 82 to 240 from Tuesday. Most of the additional strike sites are respite services for people with intellectual disabilities and day services for the elderly.The announcement followed a meeting of the INMO executive in Dublin on Saturday.Plans by the union to extend the dispute to GP out-of-hours services and community nursing services remains the subject of discussions with the HSE.The HSE said on Sunday it remained available to engage in any efforts to avert industrial action. Minister for Health Simon Harris expressed regret at the union’s decision to widen the strike.The INMO is seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry health professional grades such as physiotherapists who it maintains are paid about €7,000 more than nurses.The union argues such increases are necessary to deal with recruitment and retention issues in the health service.Further disruption in the health service is expected when hundreds of GPs take part in a protest outside the Dáil on Wednesday. The National Association of GPs is campaigning to have cuts imposed on family doctors during the economic downturn restored.A dispute involving some ambulance staff is expected to be escalated shortly, while industrial action by psychiatric nurses is ongoing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3781589.1549290818!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may to deliver brexit speech in belfast on tuesday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May is expected to explain why she is now seeking an alternative to the backstop that she had previously agreed with the European Union.

She is also expected to explain why she is now seeking an alternative to the backstop that she had previously agreed with the European Union. Her speech in Belfast is taking place as the British government seeks to conduct new negotiations with the EU about the EU-UK withdrawal deal which was comprehensively rejected by the House of Commons last month.Mrs May originally urged political and business leaders in Northern Ireland to support her Brexit deal but after it was defeated in the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 she then moved to try to find an alternative to the backstop.The British Labour Party’s Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer who met business people, trade unions and the SDLP and Sinn Féin in Belfast on Monday, said he had detected “great anxiety” in Northern Ireland after Mrs May “voted against the backstop that she negotiated”. “That has raised levels of anxiety about a no deal outcome,” he told The  on Monday.And while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has opposed the backstop Sir Keir said it appeared that some form of backstop was now inevitable. He said: “We have got concerns with the backstop but we accept that a backstop is inevitable given that the prime minister has now run down the Article 50 clock and nobody credibly thinks that a new treaty arrangement with the EU is going to be agreed by January 1st 2021. “So we have concerns about the backstop but we now recognise that a backstop is now inevitable.” Sir Keir called on Mrs May to shift from her so-called red lines and to hold a House of Commons vote on a permanent customs union to help break the Brexit deadlock.“I think the prime minister should reflect on what happened when she suffered that historic defeat. If you have red lines and then you are defeated by 230 votes you ought to rethink your red lines,” he said. “If she doesn’t parliament will have to reassert itself and sooner rather than later parliament will have to choose between the credible options still left on the table,” he added.“The prime minister has said that she wants an alternative to the backstop. She and her team and the EU have been looking for that alternative for more than 12 months and had there been an alternative the backstop would not have been agreed,” said Sir Keir. “My concern is that the prime minister has raised an expectation about an alternative to the backstop that she can’t fulfil. She needs to then decide what to do, to decide whether she is going to try to come back and ram her deal through somehow, or agree with the majority in parliament who I believe would agree to a combination of a customs union and single market alignment,” he added. “That would be far better for our economy and is the only credible way of ensuring there is no hard border in Northern Ireland,” he said.Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill, who with party leader Mary Lou McDonald is this week due to meet Mrs May, said she made it clear to Sir Keir in Belfast on Monday that the backstop was “not open to renegotiation”.“We are standing firm with the EU27 and Irish Government to ensure the backstop is protected and maintained,” she said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was encouraged by his meeting with the Labour MP. Labour have a strong history in recognising the delicate position we find ourselves in here, as well as stepping up to assist us in the progress of maintaining peace. We hope this is a position they will take in any forthcoming Brexit votes,” he said. “The SDLP have been clear, we cannot allow the disarray in London to spill over and disrupt the lives of people here. The backstop must be banked,” added Mr Eastwood.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosThe UK government has announced that a special group has been established to look at alternatives to the proposed backstop plan to avoid a hard Irish Border after Brexit. And German chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that “ creative solutions” on the Border issue must be examined. But just what could technology and advanced border processes achieve?Following the rejection of the draft withdrawal agreement in a House of Commons vote last month, the UK prime minister is pushing a plan to find alternatives to the backstop for the Irish Border. The backstop, designed to be a guarantee of no hard Irish Border no matter how future trade talks between the EU and UK work out, is unpopular with the Brexiteer lobby. This is because it would involve the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU until another way to avoid a hard Border is found – and the North would also have to follow other EU rules and regulations. So Theresa May has established a group – “The Alternative Arrangements Working Group” – to examine what alternatives exist to a hard Irish Border.They are likely to examine whether a combination of advanced customs processes and technology could be used to avoid a hard Irish Border after Brexit. They may also look at the concept of putting a time limit on the operation of the backstop. Yes. The UK government has looked in detail at this issue and it was also studied at 18 months of talks between the EU and UK leading up to the withdrawal agreement. Trade experts say that border checks can be reduced by using such methods, but by no means eliminated. The EU side has pointed out that there is no border anywhere in the world where some physical checks do not take place. UK home secretary Sajid Javid said over the weekend that he had been assured by the UK Border Force, the body which controls Britain’s borders ( though has no role in the Irish Border) that alternative arrangements did, indeed exist. However just last week John Penrose, Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, told the Commons last week that following a study commissioned by the Cabinet Office, “the conclusion was that no existing off-the-shelf package could deliver exactly what will be needed in Northern Ireland, so new solutions will be needed.” And the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, this weekend tweeted a reply to the home secretary’s claim saying that not having appropriate checks would be a “ dereliction of duty by public authorities” who must ensure public safety and enforce international agreements. A range of checks are needed on goods moving from one trading bloc to another. Broadly, goods need to be checked to clear customs, ensuring that proper duties and taxes are paid and that the content in the truck is what has been declared. And separate checks are needed to ensure goods meet standards and regulations – particularly to ensure food and animal safety.In terms of customs , a lot can be achieved by large companies registering as what is called authorised economic operators – though this requires significant additional bureaucracy – and pre-registering the movement of regular consignments. However some way is still needed to check the actual movement of these trucks – border cameras might help, though erecting these involves infrastructure – and random checks are needed to ensure compliance, at or near the border.Carol Lynch, partner in BDO in Dublin, says that generally 95 per cent of pre-registered trucks can pass through a border point without further checks, though some way is needed to monitor their entry. A further 3 per cent would be subject to checks on paperwork afterwards, while 2 per cent would be subject to full physical inspections, either due to an assessment that they are risky, or just as a random control. Some of these checks could be carried out away from the border itself. At a local level, smuggling checks would also need to be stepped up, as opportunities for profitably organised crime would increase between two different trading blocs and as VAT rules changed.No. A crunch issue is finding a way to monitor the application of rules and regulations on products – as set down by EU single market rules – particularly the movement of livestock and food. Food and livestock must be checked at the border as they enter the EU single market at designated veterinary inspection points. The Brexiteer lobby – in a report published in December called A Better Deal – said that Irish food and livestock border checks can be avoided by a combination of Ireland remaining a single bio-security zone, necessary checks taking place at factories on each side of the border and mutual recognition of regulatory regimes.However, the EU rules require detailed checks on both livestock – more than currently take place at Larne, on the entry of livestock from the UK – and on food products. Trade experts believe that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, significant checks would probably still need to take place at the Irish Border, to guard against animal diseases, for example, and – at a minimum – check food products which had entered the UK from third country markets and were now entering the EU’s single market. Technology and advanced processing can reduce the need for border checks but not eliminate them. And, as Sam Lowe, a trade expert in the Centre for European Reform in London points out, fewer checks at the border itself will mean more random checks and controls away from the Border, which would also be politically sensitive.The withdrawal agreement commits both sides to aim for the absence of physical infrastructure and the associated checks and controls.Ireland would like the Border to stay just as it is now – but this would require the UK, or at least the North, staying in a customs union with the EU and maintaining the same rules and regulations applying to goods in many areas. The Brexiteer lobby does not want to do this. Hence the search for alternative solutions. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph:  Toshifumi KitamuraPool Photo via APGerman chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday offered a way to break the deadlock over the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, calling for a creative solution to allay concerns over the future of Irish border arrangements.British prime minister Theresa May is seeking legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement with the EU to replace the Northern Irish backstop, that aims to prevent the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland.While Mrs Merkel said she did not want the so-called Withdrawal Agreement renegotiated, she added that difficult questions could be resolved with creativity, the strongest hint to date that the EU’s most powerful leader could be prepared to compromise.“There are definitely options for preserving the integrity of the single market even when Northern Ireland isn’t part of it because it is part of Britain while at the same time meeting the desire to have, if possible, no border controls,” Mrs Merkel said.“To solve this point you have to be creative and listen to each other, and such discussions can and must be conducted,” Mrs Merkel said at a news conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.Mrs Merkel said the Irish backstop issue could be solved as part of a discussion over a separate agreement on the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, offering Mrs May a potential way out of the deadlock.“We can still use the time to perhaps reach an agreement if everyone shows good will,” Mrs Merkel said.Meanwhile in Brussels, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Ireland and the EU are prepared, and want to, provide backstop “reassurances and clarity to the UK to assist the Brexit ratification process on the UK side”. But he insisted that alternatives to the backstop have been exhaustively examined and tested.Mr Coveney was in Brussels for a meeting between EU foreign ministers and their Arab League counterparts.Asked if Mrs May’s search for alternatives to the backstop is futile, Mr Coveney said that “the Irish protocol in the WA already allows for ‘alternative arrangements’ or alternative solutions to the backstop and if they are there they can replace the backstop. That’s always been the point here. The problem has been that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements have actually stood up to scrutiny. We certainly haven’t seen any that have.“We spent well over a year looking at different ways of providing the guarantee of no physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland to protect the all-Ireland economy which reinforces the peace process. Many, many, many hours were involved in coming up with a legally credible and pragmatic solution to that problem.“And in that process we looked at lots of different alternative arrangements and ideas and I have yet to hear any new thinking that goes beyond what has already been tested. And this is the issue here. What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking.”Mrs May is to visit Belfast on Tuesday to deliver a Brexit speech and meet businesspeople.Mrs May is due to reiterate the British government’s commitment to avoiding a hard border in Ireland.

Emphasising that Ireland shares the EU’s criticism of the current Venezuelan regime, Mr Coveney reiterated its joint call for fair presidential elections.“Our position has been clear,” Mr Coveney said. “We agree with the joint statement that came from the EU last week that we are calling for free and fair presidential elections to allow people to make a democratic decision in Venezuela. we are watching with interest and I will brief my cabinet colleagues tomorrow.”Ireland has traditionally taken the position that the State recognises states and not regimes.The EU had also given eight days for the Maduro government to announce elections, but has stopped short of saying it will recognise Mr Guaidó as interim president and has warned only of possible “further action” instead. The bloc’s position has been complicated by isions within Italy’s governing coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League over the crisis in Venezuela.Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, said Madrid officially recognised Mr Guaidó as Venezuela’s president with the “clear horizon” of holding elections that “were free, democratic, with guarantees and without exclusions”.“In the coming hours and days, I will contact the EU and European and Ibero-American governments that want to join forces with the cause of democracy in Venezuela to elaborate our position,” he said.The deep ties between Venezuela and Spain – its former occupying colonial power – have frayed badly during Mr Maduro’s presidency. The number of Venezuelans living in Spain more than doubled to 110,000 in the two years to July as conditions in their homeland deteriorated, according to official figures.In an interview with Spanish television on Sunday, Mr Maduro attacked Mr Sánchez and his plan to recognise Mr Guaidó.France’s president Emmanuel Macron said Paris recognised Mr Guaidó so he could “put in place an electoral process”.Jeremy Hunt, UK foreign secretary, said London would now recognise Mr Guaidó as “interim constitutional president until credible elections can be held”.Mr Guaidó proclaimed himself Venezuela’s leader on January 23rd and received the immediate backing of the US and several Latin American countries. Since then, the opposition has been seeking international support and urging the country’s military to abandon Mr Maduro.Eight European foreign ministers, including those of the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, will meet four Latin American counterparts in Uruguay’s capital Montevideo on Thursday for the first session of an international “contact group” aimed at resolving the Venezuelan crisis.Federica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, has said the bloc will also consider adding to its targeted sanctions against the Maduro regime – although such a step would require unanimity. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Most, though, were already self-harming and went online “to make sense of their behaviours”.What they experienced online, however, largely normalised their harming so that it became “a routine, everyday activity”, said the researchers. The children were also able to discover and share new practices and techniques.“They became motivated to engage in further harm … the exposure to other iniduals’ severe acts made them want to become better self-harmers,” the study reports.One woman, aged 19, told researchers she was left feeling one small cut was “not nearly good enough”.The researchers discovered a “sense of competition”. One woman, aged 23, said she chided herself when she saw images: “Why can’t I do it like that?”Tumblr was cited as the favoured site because it was easy to search and find images, enabled image sharing and was “not encumbered by the monitoring and intervention by other social media and microblogging sites”, said the study. Instagram also featured.What to do if you find out your child is self-harmingDr Nina Jacob, who led the research, said: “The lack of scrutiny and moderation, where you can purportedly ‘do what the hell you like’, together with perceived anonymity, meant the site was considered more authentic than alternative platforms.”One 19-year-old woman told researchers: “Kids as young as 12 can use it … and there’s a big self-harm community on there. I got sucked into it and it did sort of increase the intensity of my self-harm again.”In the study approved by the university’s ethics committee, the researchers displayed ads on 42,000 Facebook accounts, before 21 self-harmers – 18 girls and 3 boys – aged 16 to 24 volunteered for in-depth interviews.Three quarters were attracted to sites that provided self-harming images. One described them as “triggering a rush like an addictive high”.Dr Jon Goldin, vice-chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “When people look up the words ‘self-harm’ they should be directed to helpful sites which offer guidance and support, not to images of people hurting themselves,” he said.How to get help | Do you need someone to talk to?Tumblr refused to say how many moderators it employed but said it had teams to quickly take down any material that violated its rules by glorifying self-harm, and worked with charities and mental health experts to provide advice that automatically popped up when people put in self-harm searches.Victoria McCullough, Tumblr director of social impact and policy, said: “Research has shown that deletion of content posted by iniduals struggling with mental health issues can have the unintended consequence of ostracising them and preventing them from seeking out the support they need. Together with government and advocacy leaders, we’re working to develop innovative approaches that help those in need.”Duty of Care CampaignValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and the heart are

They’re mostly still on going.While this has been going on a union – the GMB – had a sit down with an employer – Hermes – and hammered out a deal that looks like a better way of addressing one of the most pressing issues in the current UK labour market than anything anyone else has come up with to date.\u0026nbspHermes couriers entitled to holiday pay and minimum wageEmployment tribunal rules Hermes couriers are not self-employedHermes boss is ‘shocked’ at firm’s treatment of self-employed workersOK, that may be over simplifying just a bit. There were actually several sit downs and it didn’t happen overnight. But the process is much less important than the result, which has real potential.\u0026nbspThe delivery company’s self employed courtiers will in future be able to opt for what’s being called “self employed plus” status.Those who sign up for it will secure benefits such as holiday pay (pro-rata up to 28 days), and inidually negotiated pay rates that allow them to earn at minimum of £8.55 per hour through the course of a year. They will still earn if admin issues cause delays, as they are wont to do.\u0026nbspIn addition, those who join GMB will benefit from full representation. They would be wise to do so because it will strengthen the union\u0027s hand in future negotiations, and help it deepen the relationship that has been forged in the interests of its Hermes members.\u0026nbspThere’s no sick pay, and “self employed plus” couriers may not earn the max rates they could have under the existing set up, which will still be available to those who want to remain on it.New drivers who opt for ‘plus’ status will also be required to accept routing software that dictates where they go first.\u0026nbspThose who fit in couriering part time, doing a few hours in between other gigs, may not be suited by the new arrangement.\u0026nbspBut they now have a choice that they didn’t have previously, and if other issues emerge with the new arrangement, and the two sides pursue a cooperative relationship, these could be addressed.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Hazel Sheffield reportsClick to followThe IndependentBrian Kavanagh has worked for Sgaia’s Vegan Meats since 2017Brian Kavanagh had been a butcher in Glasgow for more than 20 years when one night, everything changed.His wife, a committed vegan, showed him the film Earthlings, a 2005 documentary narrated by Joaquin Phoenix about the suffering endured by animals at factory farms and research labs.\u0026nbsp“The next morning I went into work and nothing felt right,” Kavanagh says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Suddenly the idea of putting something dead inside my body didn’t feel right.”Kavanagh was working as a manager on the meat counter at Morrisons. He had a\u0026nbspyoung family and bills to pay. He kept his feelings to himself. But going into work became harder each day.McDonald’s Sweden launches ‘McFalafel’ as first vegan Happy MealThese are the most common misconceptions about vegansWhat it’s like to stay in the world’s first vegan hotel suiteEventually he found work at a small pizza chain. When that closed down the owner of the business introduced him to Hilary Masin and Alberto Casotto, the founders of a vegan meat company called Sgaia’s Vegan Meats.Since 2017, Kavanagh has been working with the firm\u0026nbspat its Glasgow base, producing vegan meat for its\u0026nbspsuppliers and working on new recipes to meet demand. “I am a lot happier – it’s like night and day,” Kavanagh says.\u0026nbspSgaia’s is one of a rising number of food manufacturers branding their products not as vegan alternatives, but as a radical new type of meat. The size of the market for alternatives is still tiny compared with the global meat market, but there are signs the meat industry is watching closely.\u0026nbspIn the US, the beef industry has filed a petition to exclude non-animal products from the definition of meat, while the French have passed a law banning vegetarian companies from calling their products sausages, mince or bacon.\u0026nbspWhen Sean Monson, the producer of Earthlings, co-produced another film about animal rights abuses in 2018 called Dominion, groups in the meat sector reacted angrily. Patrick Hutchinson, the chief executive of the Australian Meat Industry Council, said the film was an “upsetting” representation of the industry. “What the film shows is not representative of the practices of the wider industry,” Hutchinson says. “The vast majority of their employees are deeply committed to ensuring the most humane experience possible for animals.”Veganuary finishes with record number of participantsBut Kavanagh says that even as a butcher, he was shielded from the worst practices in the industry. He got into the trade at 16 after seeing a job with a family-run shop advertised at the job centre. “When the first meat van came in, it had the first quarter of a pig with the head still on. I remember thinking I was going to throw up, but you just kind of get used to it,” he says. He stayed with the family butcher and moved on to Morrisons when it closed down, clocking 20 years in the trade.\u0026nbspAt Sgaia’s, Kavanagh is in charge of running the kitchen, keeping up with orders and experimenting with new recipes. He has just developed a square sausage recipe using similar spices he used to use in meat sausages, but switching out the animal protein for gluten and soy.\u0026nbspNext, the company is working on vegan black pudding to add to its growing range of vegan burgers, bacon, pepperoni slices and even steak. “It’s been interesting to use my knowledge for something different,” he says. “The meat all gets sliced the same way in a meat slicer, which I have been using for more than a decade, and after all that practise with sausages, I am pretty fast with a knife.”Founders Masin and Casotto, who both have Italian heritage, started making vegan meat from their home kitchen in Wales in 2013. “We’re really into making food,” Masin says. “After we turned vegan we tried to make salamino for our pizza, which is a kind of ham, and then it became more and more like a challenge to research the way these meats are cured and stored.”\u0026nbspThe business partners started to sell their products at festivals and markets, which led to enquiries from shops and cafes. Masin still remembers the panic when they got the first 14 orders through their website, before they knew how to pack the products and ship them out. “I was studying at university at the time and Aberto called me and said, ‘We can’t do this, it’s too much.’”12 best vegan shoes for womenAfter sell-out appearances at vegan festivals, Sgaia’s moved to Glasgow where it has been supported by a small business growth grant from Paisley Council to take on a catering kitchen and office space. In January, the company sold 5,000 units and 500kg of fake meat products through a handful of ethical suppliers, including Suma, Marigold Health Foods and Greencity Wholefoods, and the company website, which reads: “We don’t make fake meats: they are real, just vegan.”Many vegan meat or food technology companies are trying to get their products stocked in the meat aisles at supermarkets, where environmentally-conscious customers will be confronted with the dilemma of which product to buy. In the US, Beyond Meat has created a burger made principally of yellow pea protein that mimics the texture and taste of meat, with the intention that supermarkets sell the product alongside animal protein. In July, Sainsbury’s trialled stocking plant-based products in refrigerators alongside slaughtered meat.\u0026nbspMasin says the barrier for smaller competitors such as\u0026nbspSgaia’s\u0026nbspis not where plant-based products are stocked, but how hard it is to comply with complex safety rules and to produce at scale. “We’ve been contacted by the major retailers, but because we’re so small it’s difficult for them to work with us,” Masin says. “When the quantity is there, we will look at it.”After two decades in the meat industry, Kavanagh is enjoying working with a much smaller company. He mostly keeps his veganism to himself, apart from when he is manning the pop-up kitchen at vegan festivals, where customers are amazed by his butcher past: “If you’re working for a supermarket, it’s all about profits, basically – whereas this is about making a difference.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit, the sector likely will slide into another recession, amid weaker business confidence and tighter credit conditions. But provided a deal is signed off, the construction sector likely will enjoy strong growth soon.”Construction accounts for around 6 per cent of the UK economy.The first official estimate of growth in the final quarter of 2018 will be released next week with many analysts expecting a sharp slowdown to 0.2-0.3 per cent from 0.6 per cent growth in the third quarter.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Couriers that join the union will benefit from full representation.But David Greenhalgh, head of the employment practice at law firm Joelson, said the\u0026nbspdeal was\u0026nbspnot the landmark precedent claimed by GMB.Hermes’ decision is more reactionary than anything, coming after a tribunal decision which found its drivers to be workers, Mr Greenhalgh said.\u0026nbspFor Hermes drivers, they now at least know where they stand, but the pressure for other gig economy companies to follow suit will be reputational rather than on the back of a new legal precedent having been set.”GMB and Hermes sign deal over gig economy workers Varnish’s treatment should make us reconsider our taste for gloryUber drivers are entitled to workers’ rights, says landmark rulingNational Gallery tribunal sets precedent for public-sector gig workersDrivers for Deliveroo and Uber are among a growing number of gig economy workers fighting to have their employment status recognised so they can secure basic rights such as holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and the right to collectively bargain.Hermes is “showing that the gig economy doesn’t have to be an exploitative economy and we look forward to working with them through this groundbreaking agreement,” said GMB general secretary\u0026nbspTim Roache. “Other employers should take notice, this is how it’s done.”Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, hailed the collective-bargaining agreement as a victory for trade union representation in the so-called gig economy.He added: However, despite having lost an earlier tribunal case establishing that its couriers are entitled to employment rights, Hermes is only offering paid holidays to those who opt in.Because of the inequality of bargaining power and the ability to companies to induce or threaten workers out of rights, employment law cannot be treated as optional.”Close to 3 million people working in the UK’s gig economy, according to a February 2018 report from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).This means they do not have the security of guaranteed hours, pay as well as employment benefits. Several gig economy firms have said this gives workers\u0026nbspflexibility over when and how much they work. Critics say it amounts to exploitation and an erosion of workers’ rights.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The group was hit by a series of strikes by pilots and cabin crew which grounded hundreds of flights last summer, and was forced to increase wages.Chief executive Michael O’Leary said that while the loss was disappointing,\u0026nbsp“we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future traffic growth”.The airline said the risk of a no-deal Brexit “remains worryingly high”, and added: “While we hope that common sense will prevail, and lead to either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we have taken all necessary steps to protect Ryanair’s business in a no-deal environment.”\u0026nbspGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Ryanair is licking its wounds after a difficult 2018 that saw extra competition drive down prices and higher staff and compensation costs push expenses up.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

The half-time show easily generates as many, if not more, headlines as the game itself.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the focus for businesses, and a large number of viewers too, is on the adverts. Companies are willing to shell out huge sums of money for a portion of the airtime during the Super Bowl, with prices climbing every year and reaching more than $5m (£3.8m) for a 30 second slot in 2018.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit, the sector likely will slide into another recession, amid weaker business confidence and tighter credit conditions. But provided a deal is signed off, the construction sector likely will enjoy strong growth soon.”Construction accounts for around 6 per cent of the UK economy.The first official estimate of growth in the final quarter of 2018 will be released next week with many analysts expecting a sharp slowdown to 0.2-0.3 per cent from 0.6 per cent growth in the third quarter.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1843 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1943 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2043 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2143 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2243 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2343 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2443 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2543 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2743 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3543 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3643 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3743 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3843 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3943 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4043 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 143 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients243 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old.

Couriers that join the union will benefit from full representation.But David Greenhalgh, head of the employment practice at law firm Joelson, said the\u0026nbspdeal was\u0026nbspnot the landmark precedent claimed by GMB.Hermes’ decision is more reactionary than anything, coming after a tribunal decision which found its drivers to be workers, Mr Greenhalgh said.\u0026nbspFor Hermes drivers, they now at least know where they stand, but the pressure for other gig economy companies to follow suit will be reputational rather than on the back of a new legal precedent having been set.”GMB and Hermes sign deal over gig economy workers Varnish’s treatment should make us reconsider our taste for gloryUber drivers are entitled to workers’ rights, says landmark rulingNational Gallery tribunal sets precedent for public-sector gig workersDrivers for Deliveroo and Uber are among a growing number of gig economy workers fighting to have their employment status recognised so they can secure basic rights such as holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and the right to collectively bargain.Hermes is “showing that the gig economy doesn’t have to be an exploitative economy and we look forward to working with them through this groundbreaking agreement,” said GMB general secretary\u0026nbspTim Roache. “Other employers should take notice, this is how it’s done.”Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, hailed the collective-bargaining agreement as a victory for trade union representation in the so-called gig economy.He added: However, despite having lost an earlier tribunal case establishing that its couriers are entitled to employment rights, Hermes is only offering paid holidays to those who opt in.Because of the inequality of bargaining power and the ability to companies to induce or threaten workers out of rights, employment law cannot be treated as optional.”Close to 3 million people working in the UK’s gig economy, according to a February 2018 report from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).This means they do not have the security of guaranteed hours, pay as well as employment benefits. Several gig economy firms have said this gives workers\u0026nbspflexibility over when and how much they work.

Debate in the European parliament is a joke. Neither system is perfect, but they can learn from each other, writes Jon Stone\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFarage and Jean-Claude Juncker: the former Ukip leader is a master of the grandstand-to-viral-video formulaThis is not the House of Commons, this is the European parliament.” These were the words deputy speaker Mairead McGuinness used on Wednesday to tell off former Ukip MEPs shouting down another member during a debate in Brussels.The Brexit crisis has put the House of Commons in the international spotlight more than ever, and the chamber ides opinion. To some like McGuiness, the Commons’ boisterous atmosphere and over-the-top shouting is a sign that MPs do not take things things seriously. It is criticised as being an archaic, hostile environment that disadvantages anyone who doesn’t take a macro approach to politics – often women.Others speak highly of the drama of Britain’s mother of parliaments and sigh wearily at the dour debates in other legislatures like the European parliament. Many foreign observers who watch the Commons for the first time are captivated. An amazed American friend once genuinely asked me whether he was watching footage “from a movie”. Prime minister’s questions features regularly on US political channel C-Span and makes far more appearances there than any other foreign legislature – because it is so watchable.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI covered Westminster for years and made the jump to Brussels in 2017. I arrived with high expectations of the European parliament, expecting a modern legislature that was rationally designed rather than evolved through the centuries. Not every expectation was met: after a year and a half of working in the EU capital I believe Brussels is better than Westminster in some respects – but worse in others.Let’s start with the bad: what passes for “debate” in Brussels is a joke, and beyond awful. In Westminster the format for asking questions to a minister is designed to put them on the ropes – they get quizzed by their opposition counterpart and have to give an answer immediately after they are asked. Then there are follow-ups. Backbenchers can raise questions afterwards. If the minister doesn’t give good answers, they look stupid or evasive. It is not uncommon for answers to be newsworthy sometimes unintentionally.Drop Brexit red lines to ‘avoid backstop’, EU parliament to urgeNot so in Brussels: first, MEPs ask their questions. Then, after all the questions have been asked, the commissioner does a single summing up speech in response where he picks the questions he likes and pretends uncomfortable ones didn’t exist. There is practically zero scrutiny applied, and the system incentivises MEPs to do a piece of grandstanding to camera, so their clip can be shared on Facebook later and get 17 likes.\u0026nbspSome MEPs are better at exploiting this dynamic than others. Pro-Europeans in the UK would do well to remember that it was the European parliament, not Westminster, that gave Nigel Farage his platform to rail against the EU. The former Ukip leader is a master at the grandstand-to-viral-video formula: one extended clip of him insulting former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy (“You have all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.”) is perhaps the single most popular clip in the history of the Parliament. It has several million views across dozens of different uploads on YouTube and other streaming sites and made Farage an overnight celebrity across the world – catching the eyes of US news channels where he is now a regular fixture and an ally of Donald Trump.Created with Sketch.The Royal Gallery, Houses of Parliament — in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.Furious rhetoric has become a cottage industry: other typical video titles include “‘Who the Hell do you Think You Are?’ Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces”, “Nigel Farage: I want you all fired!” and “‘You Are a TERRIBLE Leader’ – Nigel Farage Tells Angela Merkel Everything To Her Face”. In some ways the dynamic of the parliament’s broken debates has undermined the European project itself and allowed shouty populists to differentiate themselves in a field where reasoned debate is always overshadowed by grandstanding.EU rules Gibraltar is ‘colony’ of BritainEU agrees to give UK visa-free travel even after no-deal BrexitJeremy Hardy’s best jokes: From Brexit to right wing hypocrisySenior Conservative latest to admit Brexit could be delayedThe minimal time allocated for debates in Brussels is also a serious problem that prevents serious discussion. Often, only the leaders of the European parliament’s political groups get time to speak – backbenchers are often omitted altogether, even on big issues. When regular MEPs do get a word in, it will only be a handful of them. Even the group leaders are regularly told by the chair to hurry up – we don’t have all day. A massive basketball-style clock with red lettering looms over MEPs telling them how much speaking time they have used.\u0026nbspThis is unforgiveable, and it need not be this\u0026nbspway. The limited speaking time is a function of the fact the parliament barely sits – the main chamber is usually in use for around four days a month, with occasional extra “extraordinary” sessions lasting two days. The Commons, by contrast, sits over twice as many days – even though MPs tend to have more intensive constituency duties than MEPs do. It would be easy to find more time for proper debates if only the parliament actually met more regularly.Westminster has its fair share of ridiculous spectacles: mock hostage-taking during the state opening of parliament, £80,000 animal skin parchments, and the magic mace (don’t pick it up!). But none of these traditions are as bizarre and disruptive as the monthly caravan of MEPs and their staff marching from Brussels to Strasbourg. For the unfamiliar: the European Parliament’s main offices are in Belgium’s capital, but because of a historical quirk and a whole lot of politics, it conducts most of its main sessions in France. To give you an idea of how sensible this is, the transport infrastructure between the cities is so poor that the fastest way is actually to go on the train via Paris (the parliament, in fact charters special TGVs from the French national railway company for some staff). If you’ve ever looked at a map you’ll appreciate that this makes no sense: Paris is 400km from Strasbourg, and not in the right direction.France has an effective veto on ending the practice, and even Emmanuel Macron, for all his alleged reforming zeal, wants to keep it. The situation is so inconvenient that the parliament’s secretariat actually offers to pay expenses for journalists to come to Strasbourg to encourage some to show up. It is, at least, a lovely city – certainly worth a visit or 12.It should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from itIt should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from it.\u0026nbspThe overall EU legislative process is notoriously long and convoluted, but the legislative scrutiny the parliament provides is generally very good: independent committees of MEPs and rapporteurs scrutinise laws coming from the commission and council, and all MEPs get a binding vote on their recommended changes, which are often substantial and well thought-out. Elections by proportional representation mean the commission presidency never really has an absolute single-party majority and the law-making process is genuinely consensual – it is harder to railroad through legislation than in the UK.\u0026nbspSome of the nuts and bolts of how the European parliament works are also very impressive to someone used to the 16th century practises still operating in the Commons. MEPs vote electronically, which means it takes about 10 seconds to process a vote. In Westminster a single amendment will take 15 minutes because all 650 MPs have to physically go and stand in a room together to be counted: the present system of having two ision lobbies dates back to 1835 but a similar system, which used only one lobby, dates back to at least 1584.You might think that the fact MEPs speak dozens of different languages from 28 countries would be a problem, but this is actually dealt with very well. The translation set-up is practically one of the wonders of the modern world – everyone can talk and listen to everyone else in their native language. Sometimes MEPs choose to speak in English: some are better than others, and the language barrier makes genuinely inspiring rhetoric sparse, though some does occasionally shine through.What will happen to Britain’s MEPs if Brexit is delayed?What Britain’s last ever MEPs are planning to do after BrexitIn many respects the European parliament is also far more open than Westminster. If you want to report on the House of Commons in person as a journalist, you need to be a member of the press gallery. This requires a parliamentary security pass, of which there are a limited number for journalists, with a set allocation for established publications. It is hard to get one, they are jealously guarded, and the whole system is very much a closed shop.\u0026nbspIn Brussels anyone who can prove they are a bone fide journalist can get a pass that gives them access to the EU institutions: a letter from your editor and samples of work will do. This thankfully made it easy for The Independent to set up shop here, but it also means there are far more freelancers, upstart publications, and smaller specialist outfits catering to interested audiences. Given the technical nature of a lot of legislation the EU deals with, having specialists on hand is crucial: it’s good for scrutiny, and it’s good for democracy. There has been some movement in the UK to allow new publications into the press gallery, but the issue is contentious and the process of who is allowed in is not always transparent.\u0026nbspSpecialist reporters are usually confined to newsrooms for lack of parliamentary passes – while in Brussels agricultural subsidy specialists wander the halls freely with financial services reporters and health policy correspondents.Created with Sketch.

This is not the case in Brussels: because of the way the EU is set up, the parliament plays second – or even third – fiddle to the European Commission and European Council, which are a short walk away and where most journalists congregate. The most important daily press briefing in Brussels happens at the commission, in an auditorium, on camera – while in Westminster it is done in an obscure wood-panelled room, up too many staircases, on semi-anonymous terms.\u0026nbspThe European parliament has gained more powers and importance in recent years, but it cannot yet claim to be a fully-pledged legislature – notably it lacks the ability to actually suggest laws known as legislative initiative. But in practice in Westminster there is little legislative initiative from the backbenches anyway: the UK’s broken private members’ bill system, where practically every law is talked out or “filibustered” even if there is a majority for it, means that the government has a very firm grip on the statute book indeed.Some differences between Westminster and Brussels are a matter of taste: Westminster, notably, sits in a gothic palace, while the parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are modern glass, steel, and concrete – both styles have their fans and detractors. In one way, though, the two places are more similar than they might like to admit: it notably is very easy to get lost in both, thanks to a shared history of repeated extensions, badly connected annexes, and endless nondescript corridors.There is no really answer to which parliament is better: they can both learn from each other. And really, they both need to.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a new book, ‘Do They Mean Us’,\u0026nbspCatherine Lough\u0026nbspfinds the eastern European community there is fearful for its futureClick to followThe IndependentThe Lincolnshire town voted with a 75 per cent majority to leave the EUWhen I meet Martyn Chambers, deacon at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Boston, Lincolnshire, he describes the town as “geographically isolated”.Mike Cooper, a Conservative councillor, suggests that many Westminster politicians could not place Boston, or Lincolnshire, on a map.Boston is a picturesque market town, dominated by the medieval tower of St Botolph’s Church, known locally as the Stump.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2001, its population comprised just 55,750 people, 97 per cent of whom were white British. By 2011, the population had grown to 64,637 people, 15.1 per cent of whom were immigrants.As people migrated from eastern Europe to work in local farms and factories, Cooper suggests the demographic shift was a “massive, seismic change”. He cites this as the reason behind the 2016 EU referendum result.What you can do to help demand a Final Say on BrexitThis “isolated”\u0026nbspplace had the highest recorded percentage of Leave voters in the country, with 75.6 per cent voting for Brexit. For the national media, Boston was suddenly on the map.Local politicians give various reasons for Boston’s support of Brexit. Anton Dani, an independent councillor who formerly represented Ukip, blames the pace of change. “If you suddenly have an influx of 30,000 people, people start to resent that,”\u0026nbsphe says.Dani seems an unlikely Ukip candidate he is Moroccan-born\u0026nbspand his wife is Polish. Indeed, we discuss our families’ experiences of immigration – Dani moved to the UK in the 1980s, working briefly for Marco Pierre White. My father emigrated from Argentina at the same time.Now, he runs Café de Paris, a European-style deli in Bridge Street. Yet he criticises the lack of integration in Boston as a factor behind the result.Boston is rural and labour-hungry, so there can be no suggestion that migrants are competing with locals for jobs.Created with Sketch.Britain before Brexit: Yorkshire and the Humber Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent’s photographer Richard Morgan is examining his own country in the midst of Brexit’s chaos, scrutinising the contrasts of contemporary Britain and the ambivalence of modern Britishness. A mixture of messages about Britain outside Wakefield Cathedral: beginnings and ends, closing down, war, politeness, the circus.I get talking to a Polish man outside the bus station. He’s got a Polish gas mask tied to his bag and tells me that he ordered it from Polish eBay. He is on his way to see a band in Manchester that sing about the apocalypse and plans to wear the gas mask as a tribute.A hungry Romanian man begging in front of super-enlarged images of food. He must be experiencing an acute sense of alienation: unable even to spell the word ‘please’ in the language of the society in which he is trying to survive.

The life of the high street is framed by these commercial announcements, silhouetted by their bright glow and sense of crisis.The Jamia Masjid Swafia Mosque is surrounded by high security fences, suggesting an attempt to protect itself from a local threat. There are surveillance cameras too, scanning, and they reach as high as the mosque’s crescent moon.The entrance to the Frenchgate Shopping Centre has been decorated with poetry by local poets. I suppose it is meant to brighten the place up. People walk by to do their shopping, surrounded by stories of the city and the Yorkshire region. A man waits in the hallway, uses the pillar for support, and is told of another thing he is lacking in his life. The walls of this cafe are adorned with paintings of what it’s not, of what it would like to be, perhaps, hanging there like negative mirrors, reflecting back into the emptiness the vibrancy of Parisian cafe culture in full bloom. I wonder if this place used to be a shop selling meaning to the unfulfilled, like some kind of high-street church. It has long since closed down, but the sign remains, playing a joke on the emptiness of the facade. An arcade in the town centre reserves its slot machines in three languages: English, Romanian, Polish. The lady who works there doesn’t know what the second two languages are, but says they get a lot of Eastern Europeans coming in. She tells me I’m better off photographing the ‘spice people’ - addicts to the recently emerging drug known as ‘spice’. I follow a RAF parade through the streets, thinking about the relationship between the armed forces and the civilian high street. As they march past a casino, I consider the contrasting elements: control meets chance, order meets luck, preparation meets possibility. A sign promising redevelopment is a year out of date. It is an exceptional thing to see in York\u0027s city centre and it stands out opposite a street of busy bars. Maybe it has been left there as a joke, or as a warning, or as a work of art.The RAF parade lines up outside the Minster. I notice an arrangement of people that speaks to me about the role of women in modern British society: underrepresented, but central. Outside the the Grand Hotel there is a scene of contrasting ideas about Scarborough. Simultaneously, the town is represented by multiple images: a family holidaying, ideally a solitary man smoking and staring out to sea a town being attacked, under siege. I visit a cabaret show in the ballroom of the hotel. I look for a scene that portrays the stark differences between audience and performers: an injured, resting, healing limb serenaded by high-heeled sex appeal.A shop is closing down and is trying to get rid of its stock. There is a curious row of weapons on offer, and seemingly, like an afterthought, \u0027beach stuff\u0027.A view of North Bay from the cloisters on the cliff edge.

The graffiti and the initials of the National Front darkened the view of the British seaside.Cooper says the town has “always relied on overseas labour” but cites pressures on infrastructure and housing as a reason for the result. Unscrupulous landlords exploited the increasing demand.“We’ve found some absolute horror stories,” he says. “People living in sheds two storeys up. That’s why people said,\u0026nbsp‘enough is enough.’”Cooper acknowledges the government’s austerity measures may have exacerbated problems. Boston is a low-wage economy\u0026nbspand Boston Borough Council lacks the funding to build new homes (Boston is also on a flood plain, which makes it expensive to build).UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitOne of the local estates has no money for street lighting at night. “Then they say austerity doesn’t hurt people,” he says. Has it made him doubt his own party? “Yes.”Not everyone agrees that immigration levels have been excessive. The agricultural economy relies heavily on migrant labour.Lamb feels people voted for Brexit “partially out of ignorance”, yet were also misled by the Leave campaign. In her view, it simplified complex issues: “The thing with a referendum is\u0026nbspit’s one question that really covers a hundred, or a thousand questions.“But we are desperate for these people. The way we’ve treated them and made them feel will be to our cost.“People don’t realise how they actually fill the plate. How when you go to hospital, nine times out of 10, it’s not a migrant who’s taken your place, it’s a migrant looking after you”.Her words are borne out by research from the Migration Advisory Committee\u0026nbspthat found EU migrants contributed £4.7bn more in taxation than they received in benefits in 201617, as well as contributing “much more to the health service …\u0026nbspthan they consume”.The report does echo concerns in Boston about pressures on housing. Immigration can increase\u0026nbsprental prices through greater demand, yet the report suggests that, rather than being a net result of migration, these issues are partly caused by political decision-making\u0026nbspand local authorities with “a higher refusal rate on major developments”.Arguably, pressures on services are caused by a lack of planning and foresight from the government.Brexit: How austerity convinced residents to vote LeaveHow does the Polish community feel?For the Polish community, the referendum result has caused considerable uncertainty.Outside St Mary’s Church, I speak to Eva Kowalska, an administration worker who moved from Poland in 2006. She describes Boston then as “a small village” now, its streets are bustling.“Eastern Europeans built Boston, basically,” she says. “Ninety-nine per cent of the people in the fields and the factories were Polish.”After Brexit, Kowalska feels she can no longer plan for the future. She is unconvinced by Theresa May’s wavering assurances that EU migrants will be protected –\u0026nbspthe lack of clarity is too unsettling. “A lot of eastern Europeans are terrified,”\u0026nbspshe says.Kowalska had thought of Boston as her home, but now she feels uncomfortable. “I don’t want to feel like a stranger here,” she says.\u0026nbspHer experiences with locals have been positive\u0026nbspand she was shocked by the referendum result.Przemek Frankowski, who works in the White Hart Hotel, also supports the idea of a second referendum: “I’ve always been pro-EU – I feel it’s better to be within something bigger than being separate,” he says.He has lived here for 13 years and has never felt unwelcome in Boston (“I’ve blended within the British community”) but thinks the impact on services might have contributed to the result, as well as drunkenness from a minority of immigrants.He has not witnessed visible tension or racism, although he does recall hearing people say, “We want our country back” when television crews visited the town in 2016.For Frankowski, who has a young daughter, what concerns him most is uncertainty over the future of EU migrants in the UK.“That’s the one thing I would get worried about,” he says. “We hope we’re not going to be told, ‘Oh, well, I’m sorry but you have to go. We don’t want you anymore.’ That wouldn’t be fair on anybody.”Brexit humiliation is stark reminder of Britain’s waning influenceWe have seen the brutal reality of Brexit – time to revoke and reflectHow can we tackle this Brexit mess? Give more money to the northMiki Bura, a fellow employee who moved to Boston aged nine, says his parents felt shocked and unwelcome after the referendum. “People around here thought we were really coming to take over, but that’s not true,” he says. “All we’re trying to do is get a fair play in life.”Newly-arrived immigrants are understandably more nervous. Zlana and Zlatiana Goneva, who moved from Bulgaria in 2017, run a brightly painted café selling crepes and pastries. Zlana was stunned by the result:\u0026nbsp“We came here to live our whole life. When you hear people voted against us, it means they don’t like us.“It’s strange, because we don’t make problems. We work, we help their economy.”At St\u0026nbspMary’s, I speak with Martyn Chambers as Father Kowalski prepares for the Polish-language mass.Throughout our conversation, parishioners arrive bearing parcels for a Ukrainian children’s charity. When children sing in Polish at the front of the mass, the sense of belonging is palpable.Created with Sketch.10 things immigration has done for Britain Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The 1959 classic, that is, perhaps our greatest piece of industrial design, a miracle of packaging and revolution in motoring.

To make out the Polish community has been a problem ignores the other communities we’ve had for many, many years.”He points out the long-standing Keralan, Filipino and Portuguese communities here.For Chambers, people voted for Brexit because they were misled, especially with regard to promises about the NHS. “Politicians were throwing out facts and figures like confetti,” he says. Boston’s size and geographical isolation may also have led to resentment over rising immigration levels. “The difficulty for Bostonians was the speed of change.”Despite this, he thinks “there is a great sense of community. If you go into schools, the children all have friends of different nationalities.”Indeed, the Ofsted report for Staniland Academy, which has a high proportion of EAL (English as an Additional Language) students, describes pupils who are “curious about each other’s cultures and backgrounds, and get on noticeably well together”.“The changes are coming through the young people of the town,” says Chambers. “And I passionately believe that’s showing already.”Catherine Lough is a freelance journalist studying for an MA in international journalism at City, University of London.

For Diane Abbott, a politician with extensive media experience, the show was a “horrible experience”, the worst of her many appearances on the programme. Having appeared on something like 30 episodes, that’s significant. After all, some of her early experiences were almost as eventful. \u0026nbspHer appearance on Question Time in July 1987 was particularly memorable. Abbott shared a panel with Liberal MP Cyril Smith and Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, with Robin Day in the chair. Then, as now, it was the discussion of opinion polls that caused uproar. The polls, Smith commented forcefully, showed that Labour was unelectable, “and one of the reasons for it,”\u0026nbsphe added, “is Diane Abbott and people like her...”\u0026nbspThe largely white audience applauded, and after a moment’s delay chuckled, seeming to get some unspoken joke. Abbott called him out:\u0026nbsp“If Mr Smith believes that having black people in parliament for the first time is in some sense a backward step, thousands of people that voted for me in Hackney North would disagree.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe response was immediate. For Heseltine this was beyond the pale. He appealed to Day to intervene. The audience protested vocally. “I honestly believe,”\u0026nbspsaid one white man, “that the vast majority of the audience here do not see Diane as a black person.”\u0026nbspThis went down well, as did his thought that Abbott was the panellist showing true prejudice for assuming that white people perceived race. Day wrapped up the discussion apologising to the audience for calling Abbott black, his implication being that unless he had said so, none of the white people in the crowd would have been able to tell.The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgraceThe 1987 episode exposes the nature of the assumptions of many white Britons about race in Thatcher’s Britain. Britain was, as Heseltine put it, a harmonious and tolerant country, white people were effectively “colourblind”, and black people who claimed otherwise were either deluded or harbouring their own anti-white prejudice.In the same way, Question Time says something important about the nature of our politics, its entrenched biases, and which political figures are taken seriously.Evidence of bias on the show is best illustrated through comparison. Abbott was interrupted twice as often as prisons minister Rory Stewart, even though Stewart spoke more often, and for more of the show. The introductions at the top of the show were far from even-handed. Stewart’s introduction covered his ministerial career, past and present, as well as his governorships in Iraq.For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weightBy comparison, Abbott’s introduction was short on detail. What is more, by linking her position as shadow home secretary to her relationship with Jeremy Corbyn, there was an implication that Abbott owed her job to a personal relationship, rather than merit. Indeed, according to several audience members, this was precisely the point made by Fiona Bruce before the show. Equally, in introducing Abbott, Bruce failed to mention her time as shadow minister for public health, her years on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee or the Treasury Select Committee, nor did she mention that Abbott is the first black woman to be elected to the Commons.Then there was Bruce’s decision to side with journalist Isabel Oakeshott’s wholly inaccurate statement that Labour was “way behind... miles behind” in the polls. At the same time, she was quick to assure the audience that Abbott was “definitely” wrong in her contention that the two main parties were essentially “level pegging”. In reality, as the BBC has subsequently acknowledged, Abbott was correct.Although this was never said explicitly, the constant interruptions (21 times compared to nine interruptions of Stewart and eight of the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman), the minimisation of Abbott’s achievements, the willingness to “correct” Abbott when she was in the right, all indicate that in some important sense, Abbott was out of place. For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weight:\u0026nbspin short, she was not treated as a serious political figure.Why not? Abbott’s treatment is perplexing. In some ways, her biography is similar to many of our political leaders. Educated at an elite university, she went on to have a career in Whitehall, then the media, and then parliament. But the fact that Abbott is a black woman, from a working-class family gives each stage of this story a different significance.She won her place at Cambridge in 1973, at a time when only 10 per cent of the university’s students were women. While the university did not collect data on student ethnicity at the time, recent research shows that she was the second black person to study at Newnham in its century-long history, and only the third black person to study history at Cambridge in the 750 years since the university’s foundation.For politicians such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, success in university politics was part of their path to Westminster. Not so for Abbott, who had little time for college debating societies. Her antipathy to university politics is easy to explain. Enoch Powell was honorary president of the university’s Conservative Society when Abbott started at Cambridge, and women were excluded from many of Cambridge’s student societies. But more than that, Abbott found the concerns of student politics essentially elitist.Abbott’s path from university to parliament was anything but straightforward. She entered the Commons in 1987, at a time when there were no black people in the house, at a time when fewer than 5 per cent of MPs were women, and at a time when there was widespread suspicion of black radicalism. Abbott’s historic success was the result of a decade of activism, working with black organisations, and within the Labour Party.Accusing the BBC of bias over Diane Abbott is a step too farDiane Abbott rejects BBC response to Question Time rowLabour demands BBC footage and apology amid Abbott Question Time rowDiane Abbott accuses BBC of anti-Corbyn bias in stinging attackDiane Abbott accuses Question Time of legitimising ‘bias and abuse’In 1978 Abbott became involved with the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD), an umbrella organisation for black and Asian women’s groups. Founded by radicals including Stella Dadzie and Olive Morris, Abbott believed that the black womanism she encountered at OWAAD was far more sophisticated and rooted in the concerns of working-class black women\u0026nbspthan the student politics she had experienced at Cambridge. \u0026nbspIn 1983 Labour politics and black radicalism came together. Together with Russell Proffit, Elaine Foster, Marc Wadsworth\u0026nbspand others, Abbott founded the Labour Party Black Sections movement, which fought for black representation at all levels of the party, with a view to gaining black representation at all levels of government. Black Sections was\u0026nbspextraordinarily controversial. The right-wing press dubbed Abbott, Paul Boateng, Linda Bellos, Bernie Grant, Sharon Atkin and other LPBS activists “Black Extremists”, “Black Militants” and “Loony Left”.\u0026nbspIn 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime ministerThe movement was\u0026nbspno less controversial inside the Labour Party, and in the run-up to the 1987 election, black candidates were regularly deselected –\u0026nbspthe party leadership seemed to feel that white voters would not turn out for black candidates. In spite of this apparent hostility from the party leadership, in spite of constant attacks in the media, four Black Sections candidates won seats in the 1987 election, Abbott\u0026nbsp(the only woman) among them.Since 1987, Abbott has had a distinguished parliamentary career. Her first major campaign\u0026nbspas an MP\u0026nbspwas against the imprisoning of refugees on Britain’s first private jail, the Earl William, a recently privatised and hastily repurposed car ferry. Abbott visited the Tamil refugees, many of whom had fled torture, highlighting their squalid conditions, and the absence of medical care. The Thatcher government refused to back down, even when the floating prison, nicknamed “the hulk” due to its obvious disrepair, broke its moorings and ran aground in the great storm of October 1987.In 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime minister. Abbott also played an important role in exposing evidence of government complicity in the “arms to Africa” scandal. Someone at the top of government was clearly irked by Abbott’s efforts on the Foreign Affair Select Committee, for a government dossier on Abbott was leaked, containing material stolen from her a decade earlier.Abbott’s skill as a parliamentarian was not lost on The Spectator. The venerable right-wing journal awarded her parliamentary speech of the year in 2008, for her forensic critique of Gordon Brown’s proposed anti-terror laws. Abbott stood for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2010, and since joining the shadow cabinet she led Labour’s attack on the government over last year’s Windrush scandal.The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuffIn spite of this long, pioneering and successful career, in spite of all of her experience in parliament, and working with grassroots campaigns, Abbott was treated with derision on Question Time.Anti-politics, and a generalised distrust of politicians is part of the current zeitgeist. Yet, even in an age of distrust some politicians are derided more than others. Privilege insulates some iniduals and groups at the expense of others. So, Oakeshott can get polling data wrong and still be taken seriously. Stewart can pull figures out of the air, and still expect to be treated with respect. But as a black woman, Abbott is routinely ridiculed, and her infrequent gaffs are seized upon as “proof”\u0026nbspthat she has no right to be at the centre of British politics.Boris Johnson is, perhaps the best example of a British politician insulated by privilege. As an exceptionally wealthy, white man he can get away with accusing the Turkish president of having sex with a goat he can brush off criticism following his use of the word “piccaninnies” he was even able to accuse Barack Obama of “ancestral dislike” of Britain, and still be given the job of foreign secretary – one of the highest offices of state.None of this is without personal consequences for Abbott, who experiences more racism now than at any time in her 35 years in politics. “Twitter has put racists into overdrive,” Abbott remarked in response to research published by Amnesty International in December 2018. The research showed that black women in journalism and politics were 84 per cent more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets. “The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuff,” she said.\u0026nbspAn earlier study by Amnesty of 900,223 tweets sent in the six months before the 2017 election\u0026nbsprevealed that Abbott received 45 per cent of all abusive tweets sent to women MPs, 10 times more than other women in parliament. According to Abbott: “It’s highly racialised and it’s also gendered because people talk about rape and they talk about my physical appearance in a way they wouldn’t talk about a man. I’m abused as a female politician and I’m abused as a black politician.”During the 2016 US election, Trump claimed infamously\u0026nbspthat he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters. He was so insulated by his status that “his people” would still support him, even if he was guilty of murder. Sadly, as\u0026nbspQuestion Time shows, a similar relationship between privilege and bias is at work in British politics.Robin Bunce is a historian based at Homerton College, University of Cambridge Paul Field is a lawyer, writer and human rights activistOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to the latest survey by\u0026nbspWhich?Travel, the Irish budget airline faces an uncertain future. To sustain its flying programme across Europe for 2019, the airline must sell 280 seats per minute. Yet according to the magazine: “Ryanair’s reputation has declined so much that thousands of respondents told the consumer champion that they would never again fly Ryanair, even if it was cheaper than its rivals.”The editor, Rory Boland, said of the airline: “It has spent the past two years cancelling thousands of flights, ruining hundreds of thousands of holidays and flouting the rules on compensation as well. The results of our survey show passengers are fed up. They should switch to one of their rivals, which prove that budget prices don’t have to mean budget service.”Ryanair’s share price has lost one-third in the past year, and is 40 per cent down on where it was in the summer of 2017. That was the summer when Ryanair started to upset passengers who choose not to pay for assigned seating. From May 2017, couples and groups who accepted “random seating” typically found themselves sitting in middle seats at the opposite ends of the aircraft. In September that year, thousands of passengers found their flights abruptly cancelled due to a shortage of pilots – which ultimately led to the grounding of 20,000 flights through the winter.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe airline then misrepresented its obligations to travellers whose flights it had cancelled, saying it was not responsible for finding departures on other airlines – even though the European air passengers’ rights rules (known as EC261) state carriers cancelling flights must pay for alternatives. Ryanair had its knuckles rapped by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The number of seats per minute Ryanair needs to sellSoon afterwards the airline gave in to demands by crew for union recognition, the first time it had happened in 32 years.The result: a string of strikes by pilots, cabin crew and airport staff. Many of them were coordinated by the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which said: “Demands of Ryanair workers – such as pay for all hours worked and an end to long-term agency employment – continue to go unaddressed.”\u0026nbspDuring 2018 many hundreds of flights were cancelled because of strikes by pilots and cabin crew. Some of the passengers affected sought compensation under EC261 regulations. Payouts are set at €250 (£223) for flights of up to 1,500km, and €400 (£357) for longer flights in Europe and North Africa. Their applications were rejected by Ryanair – which claimed the industrial action was caused by “extraordinary circumstances” and was “totally beyond the airline’s control”.But in another unprecedented intervention, the CAA urged grounded holidaymakers to claim their entitlement. Ryanair still refused, and in December 2018 the authority launched enforcement action, insisting “consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation EC261”. For an airline to change its cabin-baggage policy more than once a decade is unusual – but Ryanair passengers had to adhere to three different sets of rules in 2018.Now Martin Lewis, the MoneySavingExpert, has written to the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, about what he claims is a “systemic error” in the Ryanair booking process that changed travellers’ surnames in the same booking to be the same as the lead passenger’s. His organisation has sent a dossier of more than 160 cases to the CAA.Ryanair’s present travails are at odds with its image as the cheeky underdog. In the 1990s, as a tiny Irish airline, it seized on the European Union’s “open skies” policy to create its leading hub at Stansted airport, flying British travellers across Europe and providing Continental travellers with cheap access to London and beyond. But as Brexit approaches, some say the Irish carrier is in disarray, losing passengers in droves and seemingly destined for oblivion.How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and paying prodigious returns to shareholders?\u0026nbspYet Ryanair is set for another year as the most successful airline in Europe, flying close to 150 million people. How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised simultaneously be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and, relative to its rivals, paying prodigious returns to shareholders? The answer lies in Ryanair’s business model, which takes the “keep it simple” principle to extremes.\u0026nbspThe airline has long operated only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737-800. Pilots, cabin crew and engineers can work on any plane in the fleet. The 189 seats are another constant, avoiding the problems that other airlines – such as easyJet and British Airways – encounter when they “downsize” an aircraft.Ryanair has not always been faithful to Boeing – in the early days it used Romanian-built BAC 1-11 planes, and after it bought the KLM offshoot, Buzz, for a short while it had BAe146 jets in the fleet. But the path to success became apparent as the world assimilated the tragedy of 911. The attack on America changed much in aviation, with airlines cancelling flights and aircraft orders wholesale. And Ryanair was transformed by behaving in the opposite way .In the summer of 2001, Michael O’Leary was known in the airline business as a maverick, who had rescued an ailing regional airline by cutting fares to stimulate business. But by the end of September that year, he had become the fiercely controversial figure he remains – telling Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme that British Airways and other airlines were “screwing” the government for financial support.On 14 September 2001, the day that flights were allowed to resume across the US, with 50 new security directives in place, Boeing announced 25,000 lay-offs. In the next few days, Virgin Atlantic cut 1,200 jobs, together with its routes to Toronto and Chicago, while Aer Lingus shed 1,600 people – more than the total number employed by Ryanair. Two months after the tragedy, Ryanair predicted profits for the full financial year of close to £100m – about £10 for every passenger flown. Other airlines were haemorrhaging cash, or simply going bust (Ansett Australia, Swissair, Sabena of Belgium...).The order books of Airbus and Boeing were full of cancellations. With some almost-new jets being flown to the desert for storage, no one was buying new aircraft. Which, from the point of view of a fast-expanding, opportunistic airline is the ideal time to order some new planes. In bulk. On 24 January 2002, Ryanair ordered 100 Boeing 737s with options on 50 more – the largest ever deal for the world’s most popular plane. The cost per aircraft remains a closely guarded secret but was probably around half the list price.Created with Sketch.Travel Photographer of the Year 2018 Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Low-cost aviation relies on keeping costs down. That is obvious to say, but much harder to do. Many elements of flying, such as fuel and air-traffic charges, are priced the same whether you are British Airways or Ryanair. But aircraft ownership costs are negotiable, and at a stroke Ryanair had achieved a deal way better than its rivals.With the fleet set to treble in size, the airline set about expanding its network in a very low-cost way: setting up operations at “secondary” airports. Budget travellers soon became accustomed to finding their way to and from Frankfurt Hahn (closer to Luxembourg than to the German financial hub), Girona (“Barcelona” in Ryanair’s view) and Charleroi (“Brussels south”). Regional authorities poured millions of euros in “marketing support” into Ryanair’s operations, with accusations that the airline was benefitting from state aid.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round tripDuring an expansion that has proved, so far, recession-proof, the airline has long moved into the main airports for those cities, to the dismay of incumbents such as Lufthansa, Iberia and Brussels Airlines.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round trip, while Lufthansa of Germany has five flights each way from dawn to late evening. Passengers on business want frequent flights and a near-certainty that they can get a seat on the next departure – yet Ryanair’s model is to fill its planes as close to capacity as it can.In December, which for the first half is as low-season as the travel year gets, Ryanair flights were 95 per cent full – meaning just nine or 10 seats on the average aircraft remained empty. That achievement is all the more remarkable given the intensifying competition in short-haul aviation.\u0026nbspRyanair and easyJet have a long history of not competing head-to-head. Over the years there have been some spectacular fares wars: easyJet retired hurt after launching flights to Ireland, and for a while it was difficult to pay more than £10 from Luton to Copenhagen. While the two giant carriers have historically competed on only a handful of airport-to-airport routes, expansion makes it increasingly difficult to avoid. And even though Primera Air of Iceland and Cobalt of Cyprus have recently gone bust, other budget carriers are expanding.\u0026nbspWizz Air, the eastern European specialist, is now flying from Luton to a range of western European destinations. Norwegian Air and BA’s sister airline, Vueling, are also chasing the same market. And the “legacy carriers” from Air France to SAS are cutting costs to stay in the game. Ryanair begins 2019 as combative as ever. Cabin crew employed in Spain were planning strikes on 8, 10 and 13 January after failing to reach an agreement over employment conditions, but the airline faced them down.Ahead of Brexit, Ryanair has obtained a UK air operator’s certificate that will allow it to operate British domestic routes and flights to destinations outside the European Union after 29 March. All the available evidence shows that the lowest-cost provider wins in aviation – even with consumer voices raised against it.Ryanair may feel picked on by the authorities. At this time in 2018, Air France workers were gearing up for 15 days of strikes that disrupted many thousands of British travellers. Some BA passengers faced problems during the cabin-crew strikes that dragged on for months during 2017. Yet when the European Court of Justice ruled in April 2018 that wildcat strikes did not consititute “extraordinary circumstances”, the Civil Aviation Authority failed to urge BA and Air France travellers to claim compensation.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

Travel readers seem to have it in for Ryanair. The Boeing 737s it flies are identical to the bulk of Jet2’s fleet. They hold the same number of people in the same configuration. The only significant difference is that Ryanair’s fleet of 737-800s are younger. Jet2’s score for seating and cabin environment was four stars, while Ryanair received only one star.The most fundamental requirement for any airline is safety, but when an organisation called Airlineratings released its top 10 for “the world’s safest low-cost airlines”, Ryanair was nowhere to be seen.\u0026nbspThe UK’s struggling Flybe and the Anglo-German Thomas Cook Airlines made it, but there was no place for the Irish airline. Which is perplexing, because if you measure safety in terms of flying the highest number of passengers without any of them dying in an accident, Ryanair has the best safety record in the world by a country mile. Since its first flight in 1985, the airline has safely flown 1.25 billion people. Second place goes to easyJet, at 900 million passengers.People\u0026nbsphave flown safely with Ryanair since 1985British travellers have begun another year as the beneficiaries of the best-value air travel in the world, provided by the safest airlines. When easyJet was founded by Stelios Haji-Ioannou in 1995, his main message was that travellers could fly from London to Scotland for £29 – the price of a pair of jeans. Checking flights two days ahead, Ryanair will take you from Stansted to Edinburgh for under £26. And if that’s still too much, the airline will take you from Essex to Italy for under £15.At a time when Europe is fragmenting and slightly more than half the UK apparently wants to be alone, Ryanair is arguably doing more to keep the continent together than a planeload of politicians: connecting families, enabling employment, allowing travellers to discover that Europe is a fascinating mosaic of cultures rather than an amorphous whole.Back to that\u0026nbspWhich? Travel\u0026nbspsurvey: “Of those who said there was one airline with which they’d never travel, 70 per cent named Ryanair – no other airline came close.”Every passenger in Europe benefits from the existence of Ryanair. So while I find it surprising that the airline inflames so much adverse reaction, I believe that even the “bad-boy” image is a consumer benefit. By annoying sufficiently many people who have vowed never to fly on Ryanair, the Irish airline helps its rivals stay in business and keeps competition flourishing.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

It’s everything I wanted.”Critics have likewise written highly of the series, with Russian Doll currently holding a 100 per cent fresh rating on the aggregate website\u0026nbspRotten Tomatoes.\u0026nbsp“As the series proceeds, it gets more ambitious and more complicated in a way that’s gratifying to watch,” writes\u0026nbspSophie Gilbert for The Atlantic.\u0026nbsp”It’s still anchored, though, by its sense of place and time, and by the infinite possibilities that a night walking around New York City presents.”Joel Keller for Decider writes: “Lyonne puts on the performance of her career in this funny, emotional series.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

The group was hit by a series of strikes by pilots and cabin crew which grounded hundreds of flights last summer, and was forced to increase wages.Chief executive Michael O’Leary said that while the loss was disappointing,\u0026nbsp“we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future traffic growth”.The airline said the risk of a no-deal Brexit “remains worryingly high”, and added: “While we hope that common sense will prevail, and lead to either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we have taken all necessary steps to protect Ryanair’s business in a no-deal environment.”\u0026nbspGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Ryanair is licking its wounds after a difficult 2018 that saw extra competition drive down prices and higher staff and compensation costs push expenses up.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’ll be the ‘easiest thing in human history’As a full member of the European Union since 1973 the UK has effectively outsourced responsibility for making trade\u0026nbspdeals with other countries to the EU institutions.And those institutions have been busy.The EU now has more than 50 trade deals of various sorts with third countries either in place, partly in place, or pending. A full list can be found on the European Commission’s website here.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThese range from deals with large economies such as Canada and Japan, to middling ones such as Mexico, South Korea and Turkey, to small states such as Moldova and Botswana.The prospect of Brexit – whether a no-deal rupture in March or an orderly departure after several years – raises the question of what happens to the UK vis-à-vis those EU trade deals?How dangerous for the UK economy is the European Union’s latest adviceWill the UK be able to simply roll them over, so the terms of a laboriously negotiated deal that previously only covered, say, the EU and South Africa, now also covers the UK and South Africa too?Or would we need to renegotiate them from scratch?The UK government had hoped to simply\u0026nbsproll them over or “grandfather” them.But the Department of International Trade was forced to admit earlier this month that not a single agreement to do this had so far been signed, with only two months to go when they may be needed.Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC: “I hope they will be but there are not just dependent on the UK.

Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.This means that that UK firms which export to countries covered by those EU third country deals could suddenly the need to pay tariffs on 29 March.One of the reasons why it might be taking longer than hoped to grandfather those arrangements is something called “rules of origin” found in all in trade deals.Rules of origin specify that a certain proportion of an imported good has to have been made in the country or bloc to qualify for the preferential tariff.\u0026nbspThe proportion varies with the product in question, but it’s often around 50 per cent. The goal is to prevent other countries free-riding on other countries’ deals.According to British official, Korea is asking, in return for a rolling over of its EU trade deal to the UK, for Chinese inputs to its own cars to be treated by the UK as though they were Korean.There’s another complication. Even if third countries did roll over their trade deals,\u0026nbspwhen it comes to solving the rules of origin problem the UK would, for various technical reasons, often require not just the agreement of the third country but also the EU as well (something Peter Holmes and Michael Gasiorek of the UK Trade Policy Observatory have\u0026nbsppointed out).So the message is: when it comes to a no-deal cliff edge, don’t just worry about damage to UK trade with the EU. Worry too about UK trade with all those countries with which the EU has deals.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Speaking to reporters, he said MPs’ orders to Ms May to replace the backstop were “unreasonable”, suggesting they “take the time to read” the withdrawal agreement.“The Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement already allows for alternative solutions to replace the backstop, and if they’re there they can replace the backstop – that’s always been the point here,” he said.“The point here is that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements have actually stood up to scrutiny. We certainly haven’t\u0026nbspseen any that have.”\u0026nbspBack in Westminster the prime minister’s spokesman denied that the absence of conversations with EU leaders showed the Conservative party was still “negotiating with itself” about Brexit.He said: “She has spoken with the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

A ruse to keep us trapped indefinitely and hobble us as a newly independent trading nation.Plus, they believe Tory Remainers may bottle out before they do — and delay or halt Brexit. But that’s a huge gamble.No Deal won’t affect unelected, unaccountable, untouchable eurocrats with monstrous salaries and fat pension pots.But EU politicians should be terried.If the chaos finally tips the eurozone into recession, and hundreds of thousands lose their jobs in Ireland and across the continent, they won’t thank national leaders for sacricing them on the altar of the sacred backstop.They will join the clamour to escape the EU — and elect much less moderate politicians who will make it happen.THE day after the referendum, The Sun called for billions to be pumped into ­working-class communities ignored by London’s politicians.So Theresa May’s pledges to do just that in rundown coastal towns and Labour’s former mining heartlands are very welcome.Eventhey are decades late and a ploy to win votes for her deal.New infrastructure, NHS upgrades and skills training are just what’s needed.But we would go further, with radical regional tax breaks to lure employers.Rebalancing our economy towards Leave-voting areas and away from comfortably off Remain ones is what any Government should be doing.Labour’s “people’s vote” bores are hysterical about it, of course.The status quo suits them fine and Mrs May’s tactic could — shock, horror — secure Brexit.  THEY can’t help themselves, can they Remoaners, some in Cabinet, are itching to rubbish our chances of securing the legal assurances we need.They champ at the bit to “rule out No Deal”, to surrender every last scrap of our leverage, to ensure a meaningless, supersoft Brexit or even halt it.They cannot even keep a lid on it for two weeks while their Prime Minister and her negotiators try to secure a better deal in the national interest.If our mediocre Business Secretary Greg Clark — and others who will never reconcile themselves to the majority’s Brexit decision — are so keen to rebel, let them get on with it.Quit today, or back the PM and belt up. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, EU leaders are fed up with her.She signed off on a deal with them, assured them it could get through the Commons then lost by a record margin.They are now sceptical when the British indicate that this or that change could get the deal through Parliament.Despite the passing of the Brady amendment — saying the Commons would raty the withdrawal agreementthe so-called backstop was replaced by alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border — the EU remains doubtful as to whether this is really the case.No  acknowledges that things are not easy between Mrs May and EU leaders at the moment.One member of her circle tells me they are “waiting for the anger to subside” before they head to Brussels.A well-placed European source tells me there will be “nothing tangible in two weeks”.But there is another reason, beyond their irritation, why the EU are holding off from engaging with Mrs May.They want to see what happens when the Commons next votes on Brexit, on Valentine’s Day of all days.It is expected that Yvette Cooper will bring back her amendment which would force the Government to seek an extension to Article it can not agree a deal with the EU.If Cooper is passed, then the EU could be certain that Parliament would not allow the UK to leave the EU without a deal.At that point, the EU would have little reason to offer up a signicant concession.They would know there was no danger of either short-term No Deal disruption, which would be particularly badly timed for the EU given the slow-down in the eurozone economy, or of the UK ending up pursuing a radically dferent economic course after Brexit.However,the Cooper amendment failed again, the EU would have to confront the fact that this process really might result in No Deal.They could lose a withdrawal agreement that is good for them, and the backstop would have created the very thing it is meant to avoid — the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.In these circumstances, and with time ticking down, the EU would become more creative in its thinking.The hunt would be on for face-saving ways to try to salvage the agreement.This would not mean the EU would suddenly drop the backstop entirely.But it would be more open to, say, a time limit on it.With this change, the deal would stand a very decent chance of passing the Commons.I understand there is a growing body of opinion in the ERG, the most powerful Brexiteer bloc in the Tory party, that a three-year time limit for the backstop — which could be extended to five in exceptional circumstances — could be acceptable.Not all members of the ERG would take this.But enough of them probably would to make up the missing numbers with Labour MPs.Senior figures in the Government were encouraged by how many Labour MPs either abstained or voted against Cooper.They believe these MPs can be persuaded to back a deal.“There is a pool of Labour votes — and it is growing,” one Government source tells me.Getting  Labour votes for a deal now seems doable.Ministers and MPs must hang tight.Now would be the worst moment to weaken the UK’s negotiating position.“I DON’T know who has got any idea,” one leading Cabinet minister tells me when I ask what Theresa May’s plan is.The precise direction of the Government’s Brexit policy is still being debated. I am told “there is no set course”.Inside the Cabinet, the arguments are far from over.There are four Cabinet ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and Philip Hammond – who won’t even contemplate No Deal.They are becoming increasingly outspoken in their warnings about it.This group has no intention of piping down.However, another set of Cabinet ministers are more worried about no Brexit than No Deal.One of them tells me: “The most disastrous thing for us as a party isBrexit doesn’t happen.”Another minister tells me: “The battle is only going to intensy.”But this gang of four is not as influential as they once were.The key figure from the formerly Remain wing of the Cabinet is David Lidington, effectively May’s deputy.“Liders is in the engine room. Hammond and Rudd are shouting from the sidelines,” one Tory insider tells me.Lidington is, I understand, of the view that the cross-party talks could yield something on customs.The idea would be that the UK would leave the common commercial policy, allowing it to do its own trade deals, but seek to develop a customs arrangement with the EU that would replicate other parts of the customs union.If there is a deal, the big question is how does it get through the Commons One Cabinet minister tells me that they think Mrs May should make clear before the next vote thather deal is defeated she would request a six-month extension to Article .This Secretary of State believes it would squeeze the Tory Brexit ultras, making them choose between Mrs May’s deal and a Brexit delay.THE Labour Party is about to embark on a series of ideologically driven deselections – which is all the more reason for the Tories not to do the same.Political parties must be broad churches to succeed andthe Tories set about deselecting everyone who takes a dferent view on how to achieve Brexit, they will risk turning themselves into an overly narrow faction.For this reason, local Tories should stop thinking about deselecting Nick Boles.He is wrong on ruling out No Deal, but he is right on housing and a whole host of other issues the Conservatives need to do more on.TENSIONS are mounting inside Government about the role of Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Brexit adviser.Robbins was, I’m told, deeply irritated by reports about potential changes to the UK negotiating team.But, as one insider points out to me, there is a problem with Robbins going back to Brussels.His professional pride means he is highly sceptical about whether there’s a better deal to be done.The second problem is that this is now all about what deal will get through Parliament.But Robbins, as a civil servant, understandably doesn’t have a finger-tip feel for that.Mrs May should be relying on politicians to do this most delicate of renegotiations.In response to a request from the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Chief Medical Officer has drawn up the first Government guidelines on social media usage.This advice is clearly sensible.If these social media companies want to demonstrate some responsibility, they should start introducing a two-hour cut-off for all users under .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, women tell themselves they should have been more attentive, or more ­attractive, or better in bed.This week the once queen of the TV jungle, Vicky Pattison, admitted she was wracked with self-doubt after her now former fiancé John Noble “cheated” on her.She even said sadly thatshe was “thinner” he might have remained faithful. This made my blood run cold.It’s typical that poor Vicky chose to shoulder the responsibility for his infidelity by not being “perfect” enough, instead of directing her anger at his betrayal. Noble was spotted with a string of young women on nights out and Vicky felt publicly humiliated and betrayed.One minute she was engaged to be married and planning her wedding. Then it all broke down and she was left in floods of tears. In order to salvage some pride, she decided to break up with Noble.Vicky really thought she had met her soulmate but, instead, it turned out he was just another man she couldn’t trust. She’s utterly devastated, but it’s infuriating her first ­reaction was not to think he’s a swine and cheat but that, somehow, she was the one to blame.Now, Vicky is a smart, feisty young woman and I’m sure she realises she was being very silly to imagine that being a few pounds lighter would have changed anything. But on some level she convinced herself she wasn’t good enough for Noble. Of course,it was the other way around it would be a dferent story.Noble proved he was a man-child, a commitment-phobe and clearly in no way ready to settle down. In these days of social media, he must surely have known thathe was chatting up other girls it would end up all over Twitter and Facebook and Vicky would discover what he was up to.Former Geordie Shore star Vicky says Noble claims he was set up in the photographs taken of him canoodling with a iety of young women, but he has expressed no remorse to her for his behaviour. He hasn’t apologised for breaking Vicky’s heart though he has been back in touch to ask for her engagement ring back.Vicky revealed that he hinted the split was actually her fault and, with her self-esteem and confidence at an all-time low, she actually believed him. His actions in those nightclubs would appear to be those of someone who wants to be found out, or perhaps he is just supremely arrogant.Anyway, I think Vicky has dodged a bullet. It’s painful and raw right now but, one day, she will realise she actually had a lucky escape. Whatthey had gone ahead with the wedding and a few years, and maybe a couple of kids down the line, he turned out to be a serial adulterer Vicky is a strong girl and will bounce back from this devastating experience. I hope her next ­relationship gives her a happy ever after ending. Butit goes awry again, she must not blame herself.And nor should any woman let down by her partner.ALL credit to Peter and Emily Andre, who have provided stability for their own children as well as Peter’s older son and daughter from his marriage to Katie Price.“The Pricey”, as Katie insists in calling herself, has been through tough times dealing with her mum’s terminal illness as well as some truly disastrous relationships.She might appear to be a cartoon character, but she should not be treated as a figure of ridicule. Despite the bold front, I reckon Katie is a mass of anxieties and insecurities and she is very vulnerable right now.I’m sure she is very grateful to her ex and especially to Emily for their support. I hope she takes time out of the public eye and gets her le back on track.I WAS heartened this week by the positive reaction to a married couple who are planning a family together, but whose circumstances mean that their only real option is surrogacy.So many wished trans couple Hannah and Jake Graf well in their quest – some even offered their services as a surrogate. They are a trailblazing man and we and role models who have helped young trans men and women in tough times.Hannah, was the highest ranking transgender soldier in the Army, and was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List.While actor and filmmaker Jake stars in Colette with Keira Knightley. Dominic West, who also stars in Colette, recommended that Hannah should take over from Daniel Craig as the first female James Bond.She thought this was flattering and hilarious, but reckons Jake would do a great job in the role. I am so very fond of both of them and in awe of their positivity. Their baby will be lucky to have such kind, loving parents.RIGHT everyone, you know what to do. Vote for Ernest Shackleton as the most influential person of the th century on Tuesday night’s BBC live show of Icons. My all-time hero is up against formidable opposition including Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Alan Turing, Pablo Picasso and David Bowie.Shackleton, the famous polar explorer also known as “The Boss”, was at his best when ­confronted by impossible odds, so I’m hopeful he can pull this off.When his ship, The Endurance, was crushed in the ice , Shackleton somehow ­managed to get all his men to ­Elephant Island in rowing boats.He then made the epic -mile voyage to South Georgia, where he climbed over uncharted mountains, to finally get his crew rescued. I was lucky enough to follow in his footsteps and re-enact that journey, then to pay my respects to The Boss at his graveside in South Georgia, right.If you don’t know his story then check out his book, South, or download the astonishingly good Channel  drama, Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh. And don’t forget to vote on Tuesday for this truly iconic ­British hero.BY all accounts, the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland, ­ which focuses on two men who say they were abused by the star as youngsters, is extremely disturbing and dficult to watch. If the allegations are true, then those who enabled such vile behaviour should be brought to account.Of course, Jackson is not here to defend himself, and he was found innocent of similar charges in a  court case, but the rumours have never gone away.No one wants to believe such actions could have been committed by the pop genius, whose music is still the songbook of many people’s lives. His fans remain loyal and will not entertain the thought that he might have committed any crimes.I feel sorry for his kids, especially daughter Paris, who is rumoured to have entered rehab again due to the stress and upset over the documentary.I can’t imagine how tough this is for a woman who loved her dad, but I suspect we will never really know what went on – and those on either side of the fence will never change their minds.TENNIS ace Andy Murray shared rather more than he meant to when he posted an X-ray of his hip after an operation to relieve the pain of an injury that has all but ended his career.The eagle-eyed ­– and mucky-minded – spotted there was an interestingappendage that drew the eye.Andy, above, might not be able to play tennis at the highest level any more, but he could easily take up snooker with that thing and become a world champion.IT emerged yesterday that all staff at the maternity hospital where Kate had her three babies have been told not to take any leave in April.That would suggest that after talking to her sister in law, Meghan has changed her mind about a home birth.So we will, after all, get that photo on the steps of the Lindo Wing of yet another proud royal mum looking as though she has just stepped off a catwalk.No wonder Meghan is hugging her baby bump so tightly.She knows the little one will be blinded by flashbulbs almost from the moment of emerging from the womb.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all. This week’s amendment, co-signed by Boles and Yvette Cooper, could have holed the whole operation below the waterline.But that does not mean he should be deselected. The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs. But how anybody on the run can be entitled to taxpayers’ cash is absolutely beyond us.Gauke has form for dodging tough decisions. His plans to reform Parole Board transparency in the wake of the John Worboys fiasco are still in a holding pattern.He has been renowned as a safe pair of hands for years.That reputation is rapidly disintegrating.A STONED teenager drives his parents’ Audi and kills two people — weeks after being stopped for suspected drug-driving.You’d probably expect the lout to spend some time at Her Maj’s pleasure.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

They were just nasty.She added: Ive never eaten meat before and Ive never wanted to. I was quite shocked by it.Its completely disrupted my ethical beliefs and lestyle choice.Eleanor had shared pictures of the chicken in her wrap, which was ordered from a branch in Cardf.She tweeted: I ordered a spicy veggie wrap from one of your stores and thanks to the sheer incompetency of some of your staff I’ve been given chicken.I’ve been veggie my whole le and this has literally put me in tears as I ingested part of this wrap thinking it was veggie.The Spicy Veggie Wrap - which was launched earlier this month at £., and is labelled as Vegetarian Society Approved - is meant to have red pesto vegetarian goujon as its core ingredient, along with relish, tomato, lettuce and red onion.Eleanor had ordered the food through UberEats from a local branch in Cardf near her university digs on January .She said shed made a complaint through the app but after two hours with no response she went to McDonalds directly through Twitter.In a second tweet she said: Please can you ensure your staff are fully trained and competent when issuing out food in future please.This is a really important issue and can easily offend many customersmistakes like these are made often.Its happening all over the country, its quite serious.Eleanor didnt report the trolls to police but complained to Twitter about the worst of the comments and they have been removed.Customers from across the country have complained that they have found chicken in their McDonalds vegetarian wraps, with those in Liverpool, Birmingham, Kent, Lincoln, Yorkshire, Elgin, London and Bristol all complaining.McDonalds also offer a sweet chilli chicken wrap, suggesting perhaps a recipe mix-up is to blame.A spokesperson for McDonalds said: “We absolutely recognise that it is not acceptable to serve meat when our vegetarian product has been ordered, and we would like to apologise to any customer who has experienced this.We would also like to reassure that we have a number of procedures in place to avoid inaccurate orders, and that, after we saw that mistakes were being made, we introduced a number of additional measures in our kitchens and communicated with all stores to reduce inaccuracies quickly and effectively.This action has led to an increase in order accuracy and a reduction in contact from our customers, however we are disappointed that mistakes are still being made.We never want to disappoint customers, and any inaccuracy is not good enough – we would encourage anyone with any concerns to contact our Customer Services team.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/as-graphic-p10-kav-feb-4th.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit negotiations poker","story":"Last week’s Commons victory over Remainers — a surprise to everyone including the PM herself — has given her a strong hand to play for Britain.The PM has the unexpected authority of Parliament to scrub the hated Northern Ireland backstop. Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brandon Lewis, who was last year named the voice of Women in Politics by his party, called for Labours Northampton North candidate Sally Keeble to be fired over the liked picture, which Ms Keeble says was due to her account being hacked. A similar tweet was retweeted by the account last night, but was later deleted. Update: Ms Keeble has since said Twitter have told her that her account has been accessed from three dferent locations, apparently confirming she had been hacked. She has called on Mr Lewis to apologise: Ive now referred this matter to the police. I trust Tory Chair @BrandonLewis will now apologise and delete his tweets. --- Mr Lewis most recently hit headlines when he was accused of cheating in a parliamentary vote, after failing to honour a pairing arrangement with Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, who had recently given birth.   And he was responsible for the creation of the Conservative Party Conference app. A security breach in the app resulted in the Defence Secretarys mobile phone number being posted on the internet, and Boris Johnsons profile picture being replaced with hardcore pornography.   And yet, Mr Lewis has twice called on Jeremy Corbyn to take action over the racy image. He tweeted last night: “Wonder@JeremyCorbyn or @UKLabour will be commenting on her Twitter tastes ” And this morning, he posted: “And still waiting for @JeremyCorbyn or @UKLabour to comment on why they still have her as a PPC !!” Last February Gavin Barwell, Theresa Mays chief of staff, expressed regret after apparently responding to a tweet which contained hardcore pornography involving two schoolgirls and their mum. And Andrew Grfiths was reinstated as a Tory MP, despite having sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to two women in his constituency.   Mr Grfiths was suspended, but was given back the Tory whip in time to take part in the vote of confidence in Theresa Mays leadership. Twitter users did not react positively to Mr Lewis attack, accusing him of shaming a female politician. But due to the nature of the image, it is dficult to quote much of the reaction in a family publication. BuzzFeed reporter Alex Wickham tweeted : It’s  mate, not sure that is the best look... Columnist Owen Jones said : A senior Tory man trying to sexually shame a woman is a very very bad look. He added: Evenit wasnt accidental, who cares  Mr Lewis, challenged to resolve the furore by posting a picture of his own penis on Twitter, declined to do so, saying it was: More than unlikely!

Good luck, time off work and respect are also among the things Brits don’t feel like they are getting enough of. The study was carried out by Virgin Active, whose aim is to inspire Brits to find a balance in all aspects of their le. It also found a lack of money is the biggest barrier to getting to ‘getting enough’ in le followed by a lack of time and lack of willpower. Israel Rivera, head of group exercise at Virgin Active said: “Our research shows there are a host of things we’re not getting enough of, including exercise. Exercise can be hard to fit into your le - between your job, family and trying to have a social le.   But when you strike the right balance, and ‘Enough’ becomes part of your le, you will find you’re able to achieve more than you ever expected, whether you have  minutes or hours to spare. Salary is also on the list of things Brits arent getting enough of, along with holidays and nights outs, while some cheeky adults claimed they aren’t getting enough sex. Others feel they don’t get enough emotional support in their day-to-day lives, as well as time with their family and work satisfaction. The study, of , adults also discovered exactly what Brits consider to be enough, with seven hours sleep considered ideal – although the average adult gets less than six hours in reality. And while Brits do three hours of exercise a week, they think twice that to be the ‘perfect’ amount. They are doing better than some though, with almost one in four admitting to doing no exercise whatsoever. Out of their ‘five a day’, the average Brit consumes less than three portions, and they only get an hour and a quarter of ‘me time’.   This compares unfavourably to the one hour and  minutes of time to themselves they think is enough. Brits would also consider four-and-a-half hours a day with their family ‘enough’ but currently get just three hours. But while Brits have sex twice a week – in an ideal world, they would be getting lucky on four occasions. The nation are not falling for what they see on social media either, as nearly seven in  of those polled via OnePoll feel celebrities and influencers give unrealistic expectations of how much exercise is ‘enough’. It also emerged more than a quarter of Brits set themselves a health or fitness related New Year’s resolution, with half of those wanting to lose weight and one in three simply wanted to change their diet. Others planned to do more exercise, including running, swimming or yoga.  But  per cent haven’t been able to stick to it, with  per cent of the population feeling celebrities and influencers give people unrealistic expectations of how much exercise is ‘enough’. Rivera added: At Virgin Active we believe it’s important to take an honest approach to realistic and achievable exercise goals. We encourage our members to do whatever is enough for them, and no-one . And we can also work with each inidual member to find out exactly ‘what their enough is’.Virgin Active want Brits to find a balance in work, social or fitness goals - and are encouraging people to take an honest approach to exercise goals this year.THE TOP  THINGS WE DON’T GET ENOUGH OFSleep Holidays Disposable income Exercise Sunlight Sex Salary Good luck Fresh air Fun Me-time Time with family Laughter Cuddles Time in the day Time with friends Nights out Good TV shows Love Fruit Vegetables Water Emotional support Time off work Duvet days Work satisfaction Vitamin C Variety in our diet Respect Help from others Iron Chocolate New music Results from the gym Wine Cups of tea Cheese Social media followers Instagram likes Coffee"},{"url":null,"title":"dad being sent jamaica after","story":"NewsDad being deported to Jamaica after  years says hell have to bring kids up over SkypeOwen Haisley, , came to Britain at the age of four and was given the right to remain here - but is now due to be deported this week on a plane dubbed the convict flightShareCommentsByBeth AbbitAbigail OLeary:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsOwen was arrested on January  this year in connection with an incident in \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad who has been earmarked for deportation back to Jamaica after moving to the UK aged , says he will now have to bring his kids up via Skype. Owen Haisley, , has been living in Britain for  years and was given the right to remain here. But after serving a short sentence for assault in  - his status to legally remain in the UK has been ripped up. He is one of  people with Jamaican roots who are due to be deported on Wednesday - and flown there on a plane dubbed the convict flight by a Jamaican national newspaper, The Gleaner. Owen says the government have given him the choice of flying his children over, or speaking to the online. The distraught dad said: My children need me. I’ve been told they can either travel over and see me or I have got to keep in touch via Skype. All passengers on the so-called convict flight are alleged to have committed offences in the past. Owen says he has no family in Jamaica and hasnt been on the island since he left as a toddler. Speaking about his ordeal, Owen described how he was arrested on January  before being taken to a holding facility near Heathrow in relation to an incident in .  Speaking to the Manchester Evening News from the detention centre, he said: I hold my hands up, I have made mistakes but I have gone to prison, done my time for it, done rehabilitation and restorative justice, and they say I can’t have a second chance.Why do I have to be sent to another country and bring my children up on Skype  Owen moved to the UK in  with his mum, who was a nurse - and was given permission to remain with no restrictions. He was convicted in  of domestic assault and spent a year at HMP Risley. Owen was then told by immigration he would need to apply for the right to remain a UK resident. After a three year battle with the Home Office, Owen was arrested while signing on at an immigration centre in Salford on January . He has now been told he’s due to board a plane with another  people on Wednesday which will deport them to Jamaica. Owen, whose great aunt was part of the Windrush generation, says he is devastated at the thought of being separated from his young children. He said: Offenders with a British passport can repeatedly offend and be given another chance. I’m not a repeat offender.” Owen worked at Afflecks Palace, an indoor market, and became a well known a drum and bass and jungle DJ and MC - with residences at city centre nightclubs such as Vogue, Dry Bar and Music Box. He spent  years teaching music workshops to young people as part of the organisation Greater Manchester Music Action Zone and most recently worked as a mobile phone executive. He has worked legally with the National Insurance number he was given when he was  and paid taxes.   Owen, who holds a Jamaican passport, first spent time in London after arriving in the UK, before moving to Manchester with his great aunt  years go. He says he was originally told he had overstayed in the UK and a deportation order was issued in August . Following ious appeals to the Home Office over the last three years, he was detained and ordered to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica last year - days after the Windrush scandal broke. But the flight was cancelled for reasons the Home Office didn’t disclose. Owen ed to Manchester but was detained again last week while signing on at a Home Office centre in Salford. He was taken to Manchester Central police station and held before being taken to Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre. Owen has been at Harmondsworth immigration centre, in Middlesex, since last Sunday. He said: It’s like a prison. We’re in cells and there’s a regime a bit like a prison regime. It’s cold, the food is not that great and we’re restricted to using things like internet. “They’ve got this flight set up for Wednesday and I think they will give everyone decisions on their status that day and we won’t be able to stop it,” Owen says. “I’ve not been back to Jamaica since I left as a kid. I have been over here for a long time, I don’t know anyone over there. “Everyone got the impression of it’s a nice place as a tourist. For someone being deported you will be right in the middle of things. Where will I live and how will I survive financially    “We have been told  of us will be put on a flight accompanied by  enforcement officers will sit with us and Jamaican police will meet us and put us into a holding place. Anyone of interest to the Jamaican police will be held and everyone  will be let go.” Owen admits that he never thought to apply for a British passport because he had lived and worked in the country for so long without a problem - a decision he now regrets. He says he is worried about ing to a country he hasn’t set foot in since he was a young child with no family or friends to lean on. Owen added: “The Home Office say because of my criminality they want to deport me.” “I just wanna be given a second chance like everyone  that does a crime and serves time. “I came over here legally. I’ve lost it all because of a  month imprisonment.” Owen says he is also worried how the arrival of the flight will be received in Jamaica after hitting the headlines. Its gone out in the Gleaner. We have been set as targets. People have this impression thatyoure from England you have lots of money. But they wont even give you a change of clothing here, he said. The Home Office is issuing booklets on how to be Jamaican. Ive seen the posters in the detention centres. Friends of Owen have started a petition calling on MPs to intervene in his case in the hope they can persuade the Home Office to cancel his deportation. A Home Office spokesperson said: The UK, like many other countries, uses charter flights topeople to their country of origin where they no longer have a right to remain. The majority of those being ed are ed on scheduled, commercial flights but this isn’t always an option, especially where the inidual may be a foreign national offender.

A parliamentary report said Loujain-al-Hathloul, , is being held in solitary confinement, beaten and threatened with rape and murder for calling for an end to the country’s restrictive male ship system. Three years ago Loujain appeared with the then-Meghan Markle in a Vanity Fair photo shoot in Canada for One Young World. At the time of the summit, Meghan wrote: One Young World invites young adults from all over the road who are actively working to transform the socio-political landscape.   They are delegates who are speaking out against human rights violations, environmental crises, gender equality issues, discrimination and injustice. They are the change. The report said that one of Loujain’s torturers is the same man named as the leader of the hit squad which murdered Jamal Khashoggi. Saud al-Qahtani is reported to have told one of the eight women detainees: I’ll do whatever I like to you, and then dissolve you and flush you down the toilet. The Detention Review Panelreport says al-Qahtani was frequently present during Loujain’s torture, at times laughing at her or threatening to rape and kill her.   During the murder of Khashoggi he was said to have ordered the journalist’s killing on Skype with the words: Bring me the head of the dog. Khashoggi’s body has never been found and it’s believed his dismembered parts were dissolved in acid and either flushed away or buried in woods. The DRP report said one detainee was photographed naked and the picture then put on a table in front of her during questioning. It went on: At least one of the detainees was stripped naked in front of several of the interrogators, touched in intimate places while handcuffed and repeatedly taunted with phrases such as: ‘Where are the human rights defenders to help you  The three MPs, Crispin Blunt, Layla Moran and Paul Williams, said ‘Saudi authorities at the highest levels could, in principle, be responsible for the crime of torture’.  The detainees have been vocal supporters of women’s right to drive, announced by the authorities last year, and have also pushed for an end to the male ship system. In Saudi Arabia, women need permission of a man – either a father, husband or even a son – to do things like getting a job, travelling or getting married. The report was released after repeated requests from the three politicians for permission to visit the women in jail were ignored. DRP chairman, Crispin Blunt, said: Our conclusions are stark. The Saudi women activist detainees have been treated so badly as to sustain an international investigation for torture.  Denied proper access to medical care, legal advice or visits from their families, their solitary confinement and mistreatment are severe enough to meet the international definitions of torture. The supervisory chain of command up to the highest levels of Saudi authority would be responsible for this. Loujain’s brother talked about the horric ordeal his sister is being subjected to. Walid-al-Hathloul said: Whenever Loujain spoke about the torture sessions with my parents, her hands shook uncontrollably. I fear the pain will stay with her forever. My own baby sister said she is being whipped, beaten, electrocuted and harassed on a frequent basis. She said that sometimes there are masked men who wake her up in the middle of the night to shout unimaginable threats.

Shes helped more than  brides over the past two years offering her expertise and guidance to try and make the planning, hen weekend and wedding day itself run smoothly.Shes worked with lots of lovely brides, but also some self-confessed bridezillas who have made some very odd requests.Tfany has been asked to dye her hair to match the other bridesmaids and to make the rest of the wedding party lose weight. Shes also been sent to Ibiza to spy on the grooms stag do.   Tfany said: All these women are self proclaimed bridezillas - they seem to wear the title like a badge of honour. Ive had someone ask for my advice onto have a friend of hers as a bridesmaid because she was trying to get pregnant, and the bride didnt want a pregnant bridesmaid. Its crazy what people can be concerned about.   At one of the weddings, Tfany was asked to keep the photographer away from two attractive guests so they didnt outshine the bride. Referring to another wedding, Tfany said: One bride had her mind set on which bridesmaids dresses she wanted and was concerned some of her curvier friends wouldnt fit or suit them so as a discreet way of helping them lose weight, I organised a wellness weekend for them all which was basically a weightloss bootcamp. We spent the weekend doing yoga, eating salads and working out so it definitely wasnt your typical pre-wedding party. We were all in bed by pm most nights - its safe to say there werent any penis straws or Jagerbomb during our trip. Tfany also had to deal with a bride who had a hen-do gt list whereby the cheapest gt was pound.   Tfany, who lives in Oxfordshire, has earned a small fortune by charging up to pound, per wedding. She is now sharing her experiences of bridezillas for the first time after claiming its not the easy job that most assume. She came up with the idea of becoming a professional bridesmaid after she attending  weddings in two years and noticed a common theme at them all - an extremely stressed bride. She added: Whilst sometimes I am undercover, by the end of the wedding, and after the bride has had a few drinks, they often end up telling people who I am and that they actually only met me a couple of weeks ago.   Tfany has helped over  brides now, and been an actual bridesmaid at peoples weddings seven times - on other occasions, shes acted more as a bridal personal assistant. She said: Sometimes not having a personal or family connection to someone can be a bonus with some tasks. For example, one brides parents had orced and her dad wanted to bring his new girlfriend - who was a similar age to her - with him to the wedding and it was my job to break the news to her mum. It can be a dficult job at times but its unique and I couldnt wish for a better career despite the bridezillas.

Mr Smith got a pass out from hospital to fight the cruel decision, which had repeatedly denied him Employment Support Allowance , and has finally won his appeal, the Liverpool Echo reports.Now, Stephen will receive back-payments for the money he has wrongly been denied, including all ESA sums. A spokesman for the DWP said: We are sorry for the experience Mr Smith has had and we are committed to ensuring that people with health conditions get the support theyre entitled to.   Following the independent tribunal’s ruling, he is now receiving full ESA support. While Mr Smith continued to receive benefits and support during his appeal, we can confirm he will shortly receive all back-payments for ESA due.”Repeated calls to grant Stephen ESA were denied - despite written evidence from doctors stating that he couldnt walk for  metres without collapsing with pain and exhaustion.Stephen, of Kensington, Liverpool, has suffered with a number of serious conditions for several years. His most debilitating illness is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, an incurable respiratory problem that causes severe breathing issues and gets worse over time. But he also suffers with excruciating Osteoarthritis, has an enlarged prostate and uses a colostomy bag to go to the toilet.   Despite all of this, he failed a DWP work capability assesment in  - which meant his ESA payments were stopped and he was told to sign on for a pound a week Jobseekers Allowance, visit the job centre once a week and prove he was looking for work. Throughout this period, Stephen was living alone and didnt know where to turn as his health deteriorated. He said: I could only make it to the kitchen to make food once a day. I had no muscles in the back of my leg which meant I couldnt stand up at all - and had to lean or sit down all the time - but they were telling me I was fit for work. He believes he could have diedit wasnt for two men, Tony Nelson and Terry Craven. Tony runs the CASA community centre in Hope Street which offers support to people who dont know where to turn.   Tony introduced Mr Smith to Terry, a former city council welfare officer who works at the CASA advising people on benefit claims. After Stephen was kicked off ESA, Terry took up his case and battled with the DWP to get him the benefits he knew he deserved. In response to the DWPs U-turn, Terry said: It is an outrage for a senior citizen of one of the richest countries in the world to have been treated like this by a Government department. Steve should not have been deprived of his just entitlement for a week let alone two years. He has worked all his le and ran several businesses successfully. This Government’s policies and its denial of poverty are challenged by Steve’s circumstances. No justication could possibly exonerate this Govermment’s responsibility for Steve’s plight. I am just glad this is not a death story. Am I owed back payments  Most of those affected are people who moved from incapacity benefit to the contributory version of ESA.

This included sending the opinions of two separate doctors who both confirmed the signicant dficulty and pain experienced by Mr Smith when completing simple movements and daily activities. One doctors note stated: It is my opinion that Mr Smith could not walk  metres without pain or exhaustion. But despite this, in January last year, his appeal was rejected by the DWP who told him that he hadnt scored the required number of points to deem him as having limited capability for work. But Stephen and Terry continued to battle over the next year and eventually were granted the chance to fight the decision in a tribunal earlier this month -  months on from that DWP rejection. Speaking today, Terry said: I have got lots of cases like Steves - I have a client at the moment who is actually on dialysis and has been thrown off benefits.

Dominique Montgomery, , survived for years on nothing by greasy fast food - eventually reaching stlb. Despite suffering cruel taunts and bullying - even once having a burrito thrown at her by a total stranger at a football game - Dominique never lost sight of her dream to become a model. Now, following a remarkable transformation whereby she shed  stone, Dominique has strutted her stuff on the runway at the USAs celebrated Los Angeles Fashion Week - and will repeat the experience at the New York shows next month. Reliving the terrying  day which changed her le, after she became trapped by a rapidly rising tide, Dominique, of Los Angeles, Calornia, said: “I always wanted to model, but was so focused on being overweight that I had no idea how it would happen. “But now, my confidence has improved so much and I have learned not to be so hard on myself.   “I can’t explain how exciting it feels to be up on that runway. You can’t even see anything as the lights are so bright – all you can hear are cheers.” Embarking on her first diet aged just five, so big her school unorms had to be specially made, Dominique, who has also started her own personal training business, combining mindfulness with fitness and nutrition, has fought a lelong battle with her weight. After trying and failing on a multitude of diets, eventually resigning herself to a letime of obesity, she admitted: “I struggled with an eating disorder that most people don’t talk about – binge eating. “I couldn’t control how much I ate and, eventually, I stopped caring. As I was already so big, I thought nobody would noticeI ate more.”  Enjoying a staple diet of fast food and takeaways, washed down with fizzy pop, Dominique struggled with portion control and regularly ordered meals like fried chicken with double chips and two biscuits – a scone-like buttermilk bake – or a burrito “as big as her head,” with two large tacos on the side. “I would eat at least , calories a day. Sometimes, I would have large shakes for dessert that were about , calories by themselves,” she said. Her self-esteem shrinking with every pound she gained, Dominique eventually took to eating in her car, away from the prying eyes of judgemental strangers.   She added: “My confidence was low. I felt very hopeless and began to irrationally blame every problem in my le on being big.” But everything changed in July , during a day at the beach with friends. She recalled: “I was swimming around, feeling great, when all of a sudden, the tide got high. “Everyone managed to push themselves out of the water onto some rocks, but I was stuck, because I wasn’t physically able to lt myself out. Everyone tried to help, but I was too heavy. “I thought I was going to die and had no idea what to do. I was terried.” Thankfully, she managed to hold on until the water calmed, but she was left severely shaken. She added: “If I couldn’t even help myself out of the water, then what was I doing with my le ” Since then, Dominique, who now weighs just over st and is a UK size eight, has embarked on a healthy regime, ditching the fast food and heading to the gym. But, having been left with folds of excess skin - particularly around her stomach - by her rapid weight loss, while she has toned up slightly by working out, she is also saving for ,surgery to remove it.   Around four months ago, keen to help to others beginning their own weight loss journeys, she even launched her own personal training company. “Lots of people were asking me how to lose weight, so I wanted to devise something that tackles fitness and nutrition as well as mindset. It’s important to look at why people have gotten to that point, and what is stunting their progress,” she said. “I am hoping to eventually make it an online business, so anyone from anywhere in the world can get involved.” Then, in October , after finding herself an agent and trainer, Dominique fulfilled her lelong ambition - becoming a runway star at Los Angeles Fashion Week, modelling for brands Lorenz Couture and Esti Nay, as well as in showcases for The Model Experience and Model Mafia LA. And, shining in the spotlight, all her insecurities about her remaining apron of skin melted away. She added: “With my first show, it did cause a little problem as I’d applied some  tan, which ended up uneven where my skin folded over – but I changed outfit last minute so you couldn’t see it.   “I prefer walking in couture shows, as you can wear lovely long, flowing gowns but either way, when you’re up there, it’s so exciting that you don’t think about much .” In February, Dominique will also be giving a repeat performance at New York Fashion Week, and hopes it will pave the way to one day realising her ultimate dream of starring in the iconic Victoria’s Secret fashion show. “The designs are impeccable, and it is just such a renowned show,” she sighed. Her le – and body – now unrecognisable, Dominique has even written a book called The Gt, in which she shares everything she has learnt about confidence, self-belief and achieving your goals. “All I want to do now is help and motivate people in any way I can,” she said. “I also want to reassure people that it’s okay to go at their own pace and that every dream, everything that starts with a thought, is absolutely possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"spent week living universal credit","story":"NewsI spent a week living on Universal Credit - this is what its likeReceiving weekly allowance for a -year-old, one young reporter ended up with just £ a day to spend on food, heating and travelShareCommentsByAlex GroveBen Weich:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video what-is-universal-credit-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Governments controversial Universal Credit scheme has rarely been out of the headlines during its troubled roll-out across the country.Stories abound of claimants having to turn to food banks, and the programme was recently revealed to have the lowest satisfaction score of any welfare benefit.But what is it actually like to live on Universal Credit  Keen to demonstrate the adversities faced by those on the scheme, Hull Live reporter Alex Grove volunteered to live solely on a weekly benefits allowance, based on calculations made by the Citizens Advice Bureau. As a -year-old man living in private rented shared accommodation, with no disabilities or children, he received pound. for the month – or roughly pound. per week. But even that was quickly chipped away at by deductions, with Hull City Council tax taking pound. a week, and a further pound was set aside for gas and electric.   Alex was left with scarcely more than pound per week – not taking into account water rates, his mobile phone contract, car insurance or road tax. The most he was offered to go towards his rent was pound. a week, with any shortfall coming out of his own pocket. He said: That left me with pound a day, and I quickly realised some of my typical outgoings during the week would have to be signicantly reduced. With a limited amount of money to spend, I soon realised just how much money I waste during the week, particularly during my days at work. Takeaways were also a no-go. Lazily, I do sometimes find myself having a scroll through Deliveroo and picking out a meal or heading over to McDonalds – particularly when I’m hungover. But having a takeaway even just once a week would completely wipe out my budget, so I had no choice but to make the most of my weekly food shops and resist indulging on junk food.   It soon dawned on Alex that even Tesco meal deals – priced at pound, or half his daily allowance – would have to fall by the wayside, too. Alex added: I am a sucker for a Tesco meal deal which sets me back pound a day and although it’s a great offer, it costs me almost half of my daily budget. I knew I had to change my ways so every night I made sandwiches to take into work and bought multipacks of crisps instead of wasting money buying inidual packs as part of a meal deal. Universal Credit, dubbed a “six-in-one” payment, has been labelled a “shambles” by critical MPs. Earlier this month, the Works and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd announced a string of changes to save Universal Credit from further disaster, but maintains it will be fully implemented by . Margaret Greenwood, Labours shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, has called for it to be halted entirely, claiming that it has been used as a vehicle for cuts to social security.   Reporting in Hull Live, Alex said he found that there was no room for me to be able to afford what most would constitute as a respectable social le. He wrote: Couple of pints down the pub with your mates  No chance. A meal out at a restaurant  In your dreams. On the budget I had, there just wasn’t enough money to go towards typical social activities for a man of my age. I like a tipple sometimes after a day at work, but this was something I just could not financially manage given the limited budget I had at my disposal.   Yes, you can buy packs of lager and cider in supermarkets and minimarts but these will still set you back and realistically, alcohol is something you just have to do without. He also described paying for his car to be unrealistic, as fuel prices, road tax and breakdown cover piled up. He was left to fork out for public transport fares to get to his local Jobcentre to sign on. The young reporter concluded that his weekly allowance on Universal Credit was adequate, as long as he managed to resist indulging in alcohol or recreational activities.   He said: I would have been living on the breadline and, although you receive more moneyyou have children and other relatives to look after, ultimately, you have more mouths to feed and that presents dficulties. There is a high possibility, particularly at a time when we are experiencing sub-zero temperatures, that I would have had to endure freezing cold nights and sacriced my warmth in order to get by.

Wildle fan Ian Harvey says he came face to face with the “frightening big cat” during a morning stroll. He claims the creature was “basking in the sunshine” and lying down against the hedgerows close to the pitch.Mr Harvey, , was left “in shock” as the cat apparently started skulking towards him, Derbyshire Live reports.And he’s not the only walker to have reportedly seen the feline beast. The canopy-maker recalled: “I walked on towards the football pitch and saw something lying down against the hedgerows on the opposite side of the pitch that I thought was a deer.  It was facing the road. I took another five or six steps and and it turned its head towards me and looked right at me. At that point, I though thats a cat - its got a cats face. “It carried on staring at me and I was staring back. I dared not go any closer. Im probably about  yards away by now.” Mr Harvey also said that he was convinced the animal was a puma because of its “unmistakable big cat curved tail”. He went on: It was a bit frightening when I realised what I was seeing - I know all about big cats and pumas have been known to attack people in America. It didnt seem the slightest bit scared to see me.  I can only presume its roaming around the Swadlincote area and the reason it was in the park was because it had been a very cold night and it was in direct sunlight, lying there to get warm. Mr Harveys reported sighting happened at around am on January  at a park on Occupation Road, Albert Village. The wildle enthusiast, from Swadlincote, had gone for a walk on his morning break in pursuit of a kestrel he was watching. His sighting of a puma - which is typically found in the mountains of North and South America - is one of many reported instances of big cats roaming around the area.

The social media giant today has more than .billion users and last year its profits soared  per cent to an incredible .billion. But it has also been tarnished by a number of high-profile scandals and crises over the years, from privacy issues to accusations it helped Russia sabotage the US elections. Here are Facebook’s most controversial moments… September : Co-founder cut out  Facebook started with a controversy when Mark Zuckerberg kicked out co-founder Eduardo Saverin within months of the social network being launched in February . In late , fellow Hard undergraduates Mark and Eduardo worked together to launch The Facebook, with Brazilian Eduardo investing , in exchange for  per cent of the company. It proved incredibly popular at Harward but when Zuckerberg, along with another student, Dusty Muskovitz, moved to Palo Alto six months later to develop the company, Saverin moved to New York and worked on another start-up. Their relationship soured and in September  Zuckerberg cut Saverin out by creating a new company to acquire the old firm, then distributed shares in the start up to everybody but him.  Saverin eventually sued Facebook and he settled with a five per cent stake in the company - that is now worth close to billion. November : Beacon ads controversy Facebook launched the Beacon advertising system in , which was designed to track the activities of users on  partner websites and then report these activities to their Facebook friends, unless they specically were told not to do so. It generated a storm of privacy complaints over the tracking of user activities, with many claiming the site had adopted Big Brother tactics to make money. There were also allegations that web partners shared user information without their consent. One man, for instance, bought jewellery online for his we, who was then notied of the purchase - along with all of his other Facebook friends. The couple ended up as part of a class-action lawsuit against the site for violating federal privacy laws. The system prompted , people to sign up to an online petition entitled Facebook, stop invading my privacy!”.  After an uproar Facebook eventually let users turn Beacon off and CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologised. In a blog entry Zuckerberg said: Weve made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but weve made even more with how weve handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologise for it.  May : Canada privacy report The Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinicaccused Facebook of deceiving its users and breaking privacy laws in a complaint to Canada’s Privacy Commissioners. The group released a -page complaint detailing  separate violations of the law, including how third-party applications collect all information available about Facebook users when they’re added and can even access information about other people through the user’s friends list. At the time Canada was third in overall users on Facebook, with about seven million users. October : Apps privacy scandal An investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that  of the most popular Facebook apps - including FarmVille and Mafia wars - were being given users’ identity numbers and the ability to track names, online habits, and other personal information, regardless of privacy settings.  The newspaper found that three of the top  apps, including FarmVille, had not only transmitted users IDs to outside companies but also personal information about users’ friends. Facebook, which by now had million users, acknowledged the mistake. Both Facebook and Zynga, the company behind Farmville and other apps, were hit with lawsuits based on the privacy breaches. June : Tag Suggest scandal Facebook faced further criticism over its privacy policies in June  for quietly switching on technology that automatically identies people in photos. The Tag Suggestions system uses facial recognition software to identy iniduals as photos are uploaded, and then encourages their friends to tag them so that others can easily access the images. The feature was turned on by default, meaning members had to opt outthey didn’t want to be part of the system. It lead to an outcry from privacy campaigners, who claimed that data had been collected and processed without consent. Following an investigation by privacy authorities in Ireland and Germany Facebook was forced to switch off its facial recognition tool and delete data collected from European users in October .   February : Free Basics flop A Facebook project which was supposed to provide free internet to the world’s poorest people flopped spectacularly after it was accused of “digital colonialism”. Free Basics offered users in more than  countries a narrowed down version of the internet, in partnership with local telephone companies who agreed to reduce data charges to zero. The catch - it wasn’t real internet access, but a selection of apps and services controlled by, and always including, Facebook. The project was discontinued after the Indian government closed down Free Basics following months of protests referred to as the modern ‘Quit India’ - when Mahatma Gandhi expelled the British in . Following the decision Facebook board member Mark Andreessen tweeted sarcastically, “Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now ”  He later tweeted: “I apologize for any offense caused by my earlier tweet about Indian history and politics. I admire India and the Indian people enormously.” May : Trending Topics claims Facebook endured some of its most sustained criticism to date after a number of publications leaked information on the internal process behind Trending Topics, the network’s column of the day’s top news stories. Former employees alleged that Facebook deliberately blacklisted certain topics and sources, boosted topics that weren’t actually trending, and intentionally suppressed conservative media. They also claimed writers who drafted the blurbs were told to change words, like renaming Twitter and Snapchat “social networks.” Facebook denied claims of bias, but said its guidelines had been claried and reviewers undergone refresher training “that emphasised content decisions may not be made on the basis of politics or ideology”.   October : Russian meddling scandal Facebook admitted that Russian groups intent on influencing the  US presidential election flooded Facebook with propaganda ads and  information. It eventually said Russian accounts bought more than , worth of ads.  In remarks made to Congress in October , Facebook said the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin, had posted around , pieces of ides content that was shown to about million people between January  and August . Those posts were then liked, shared and followed by others, spreading the messages to tens of millions more people. Widespread criticism over the issue eventually made Zuckerberg take responsibility, posting: I started Facebook, and at the end of the day, I’m responsible for what happens on our . “I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community, Facebook has a “responsibility” to protect its user’s data andit fails, “we don’t deserve to serve you.” March : Cambridge Analytica scandal It was revealed that Facebook had inadvertently allowed political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to gather data from million users, which was then reportedly used to influence the  presidential election. The information was gathered through an app that paid users to take a personality test but that also harvested details about their Facebook friends. It was then shared with Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trumps campaign team in the  US presidential election and used the data to build a software programme to target political advertising in the US.  In October last year Facebook was fined pound, by the UK’s Information Commissioners Officeover the data scandal, saying the social network “contravened the law by failing to safeguard people’s information.” March : Myanmar claims In the latest in a series of criticisms about the proleration of fake news, Facebook was blamed for enabling the spread of fake news in Myanmar about Rohingya Muslims, who are being systematically slaughtered. The social media giant admitted it failed to prevent its  from being used to “foment ision and inside offline violence” in the country, and vowed to invest resources in addressing the abuse of the network in the country. It isn’t the only country where Facebook has been accused of inciting violence. Following anti-Muslim violence in Sri Lanka, the country ordered internet providers and mobile phone carriers to shut down both Facebook and WhatsApp, while government officials in Papua New Guinea considered the same. March : Maybe someone dies scandal BuzzFeed News published an internal memo from Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth in which one of Zuckerberg’s most trusted lieutenants calls any effort to connect the world a “de facto good. He had written in June : “Maybe it costs a le by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools... And still we connect people.” The note caused a backlash externally in light of troubling events, including Facebook’s role in abetting genocide in Myanmar and its role in broadcasting a spate of suicides and murders on its livestreaming tool. In a statement, Zuckerberg disputed the idea that Bosworth was speaking for the company and said: “Weve never believed the ends justy the means.” Bosworth tweeted - and later deleted: “I don’t agree with the post today and I didn’t agree with it even when I wrote it.” September : Biggest ever data breach  Facebook disclosed that it had been hit by its worst ever data breach, affecting million users - including those of Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Attackers exploited the sites View As feature, which lets people see what their profiles look like to other users. The unknown attackers took advantage of a feature in the code called Access Tokens, to take over peoples accounts, potentially giving hackers access to private messages, photos and posts, and also tried to harvest peoples private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebooks systems.

Known as iridium, its the worlds rarest element. Blasting it with a laser beam produces a poisonous form of oxygen that is deadly for tumour cells - and harmless for healthy ones. Experiments showed it penetrates the nucleus of cancer cells by latching onto the blood protein albumin. It could revolutionise treatment for the deadliest forms of the disease, say British scientists. It becomes toxic only when exposed to light - an existing treatment known as photodynamic therapy.   This activates the metal to kill them through oxidisation - where the cells own oxygen is converted into a lethal form. Vitally, healthy tissue is unaffected.Professor Peter Sadler, from the department of chemistry at Warwick University, said:Its amazing this large protein can penetrate into cancer cells and deliver iridium which can kill them selectively on activation with visible light.If this technology can be translated into the clinic it might be effective against resistant cancers and reduce the side effects of chemotherapy. He said it can be applied locally - and in smaller doses. The next step is pre-clinical animal trials. His international team used a special organic coating to hook up iridium to albumin - which then glowed very brightly.   Under powerful microscopes they tracked its passage into lung cancer tumours grown in the lab - and found it destroyed them. Photodynamic therapy is based on chemical compounds called photosensitizers that produce oxidising species when switched on by lasers. Its already being used to treat a range of common cancers including those of the skin, breast and lung. When photosensitisers are exposed to a specic wave of light they produce a form of oxygen that kills nearby cells. Clinicians can target them to specically attack cancer cells using thin, flexible tubes called optical fibres that carry light signals.  The study published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition found the iridium based compound is an excellent photosensitiser. What is more albumin was able to deliver it right into the nucleus of cancer cells - which contains all the genetic material. The dormant iridium can then be turned on by red laser light irradiation - destroying them from their very centre. The bright luminescence of the iridium allowed its accumulation in the nucleus of tumours - and its activation leading to the death of cells - to be followed in real time.  Co-author Dr Cinzia Imberti, also from Warwick, said: Its fascinating how albumin can deliver our photosensitiser so specically to the nucleus. We are at a very early stage, but we are looking forward to see where the pre-clinical development of this new compound can lead. The idea is when light is shone onto tumours through the skin the compound will effectively kill tumours - leaving healthy cells untouched. With cancer becoming resistant to certain treatments its crucial to find other methods such as this.  The compound damages proteins that manage heat shock stress and glucose metabolism - crucial molecules for cancers survival. Dr Imberti said: Our team is not only extremely multidisciplinary, including biologists, chemists and pharmacists, but also highly international, including young researchers from China, India and Italy supported by Royal Society Newton and Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowships. Iridium landed in the Gulf of Mexico  million years ago on the massive seven mile wide space rock that killed off  percent of living species - including the dinosaurs. Laser-based techniques are emerging as viable treatments for cancer - targeting tumours far more precisely than the shotgun blast of radiation and chemotherapy. The brittle silvery-white metal has no effect on non-cancerous tissue - indicating its a highly targeted treatment that doesnt attack healthy cells. Its found in the world famous Chicxulub crater underneath the Yucatan Peninsula caused by the asteroid strike believed responsible for the death of the dinosaurs. The precious metal platinum is already used in over half of cancer chemo-therapies. Prof Sadler believes other precious metals like iridium - that are safe with minimum side-effects - can potentially combat resistance. He says: Its certainly now time to try to make good medical use of the iridium delivered to us by an asteroid  million years ago.

Maria Rotiroti has reportedly been living with Vince Zangari in her northern Sydney home in Australia for the last eight years. He remains a suspect in the cold case murder of her father Salvatore Sam Rotiroti, according to police - who call Zangari a person of interest. Rotiroti was beaten to death in his driveway in Geelong, Melbourne, in September  - when Maria was just  years old. While Vince Zangari was charged for the murder, the case against him was dropped and there is no reason to believe he carried out the brutal killing. Despite this, Marias brother Vince Rotiroti said his father would come out of his gravehe knew about the living arrangement, reports the Mail. He told The Herald Sun : Its shocking that she is living with the man police suspect of committing the murder.   Maria and Vinces father Sam Rotiroti worked a concreter, and shortly before his death had paid a , ransom to have his kidnapped son Tony freed. The unknown kidnapper had tried extorting more money from Rotiroti before he was found dead on his driveway. During their investigation, police swooped on then -year-old Vince Zangari, who was charged. However, the case charge was dropped when witnesses began withdrawing or changing their statements. Now living under the name of Luke Conrad, Zangari, and Maria Rotiroti also jointly owned a property in Double Bay, an affluent harbourside suburb in Sydney.   They were both declared bankrupt in . Last year, a million reward for information on the cold case murder which would lead to a conviction was offered by homicide detectives. Detective Inspector Tim Day confirmed at the time that Zangari remains a person of interest in the investigation and believed Mr Rotirotis family had more information. He said: We are appealing directly to those people to come forward and help us solve this murder.

The gaffer will get us ready for it and we need to make sure we go and do the business.”The performance at Somerset Park was a bitter disappointment for the  United fans who made the long trip on a Friday night.And Clark admits it wasn’t good enough from the Tangerines.He added: “We went down to Ayr with full intentions of winning the game.“We gave ourselves a chance a couple of weeks ago against Dunfermline when we won and got ourselves up the league but we let ourselves and the fans down on Friday.“The weather meant it was never going to be a pretty game and they got a chance early on and took it.“I think we only had one real chance with Aidan towards the end where the goalie was out quick and made a good save.“All in all it was a very frustrating night and we were very disappointed.”Strong winds made le dficult for all the players but it was clear Ian McCall’s men coped far better with the conditions than United.The home side dominated the opening period and got their goal through Craig Moore early on but the expected response from the Tangerines with the wind in their favour in the second half never really materialised.Clark added: “It was dficult conditions but we’ve all played in wind like that before, we all know what it’s like.“We had a game plan – I don’t knowwe didn’t stick to it but it never happened for us.“We’re disappointed because that’s nine points we’ve given Ayr this season and we’re making it very hard for ourselves.”It’s been a stop-start first season at the club for Clark with a series of injuries curtailing his first-team opportunities.Now, though, he says he’s back to % and ready to help United get back on track.“It’s been very frustrating for me, I’ve missed a lot of games with daft wee injuries here and there where you can’t actually treat them, you just have to leave them until they get better.“It’s been frustrating but I’m back and feeling good now so, hopefully, I can kick on now and help the team get where we want to be.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee united man one of two new arrivals at dundee","story":"Dundee have completed a double transfer swoop today.The club have secured the loan signings

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Gin and tonic anyone ” “Large ones all round!” To be serious though – I still can’t decide what made me angrier. The crass begging bowl letter – hoping to cash in on the biggest Burns day of the year  Or the fact that Burns Cottage has been allowed to fall into such a state that phrases like “damaged beyond repair” are even necessary  If we’re talking man’s insensitivity to man here – then last Friday’s NTS letter takes the bannock! Its contents have upset dozens of people I know – and judging by the reaction on social media, hundreds more that I don’t know. Nicky Cotter wrote: “NTS . . . put your hands in your pockets and get it fixed. If you can spend pound, on a wooden tree house at Culzean Castle – you can stump up pound, to fix one of the most historically and culturally signicant buildings in Scotland”. Spot on, sir. The NTS letter tells us that “time and Scotland’s wet winters have taken their toll”. Yes – that’ll be the  winters since Burns father William Burness built the cottage on . And during that period, it’s been thatched more times than Wayne Rooney’s balding napper. If the current thatch “has signicant tears and has worn away”, you have to askthe last thatching work was in some way inferior - orthe cottage needed re-thatched several years ago and the work was never undertaken  You then start wondering how the auld clay biggin’ managed to survive the  wet Scottish winters between the cottage being built and the National Trust for Scotland’s formation back in   The answer is fairly obvious. Back then – people looked after it! And you only have to look at the recent row over the deteriorating Burns Monument to start wonderingthe NTS is the right custodian of our Burns heritage  Burns Cottage is everything Mr Cotter said earlier . .. and more. It’s the most important building in Ayrshire – by a lang Scots mile. Every nook, cranny - and twig of its roof - should be the subject of a fingertip, annual inspection. And whatever work is required – at whatever cost – should be sanctioned immediately. In fact, I imagine that’s what ‘most people’ thought was already happening. But then we had last Friday’s mail . . . when ‘most people’ discovered to their horror that the north-west gable is starting to pull away from the rest of the cottage! If admission fees don’t cover the cost of Burns Cottage – then put them up! The last figures I have show , visitors in . Charging them an extra p would have reached the pound, required – with enough left over to putty the windows as well. So, I’m sorry, NTS.

A Las Vegas neon sign – which Nan popped on for the festivities – had caught alight. Quick-thinking Lewis, along with pal Lauren Kennedy, sounded the alarm, got Nan to safety and dampened the fire with towels before the fire brigade arrived at the scene.Lewis told the Ayrshire Post : “The whole night was a blur.“We were driving back from work and I saw a fire in the window. “I was chapping on the door and ringing the doorbell. “The full house was covered in black smoke. “I couldn’t see anything. “I didn’t know how long the firemen were going to take and the house was still on fire so I thought I needed to do something. “Nan was shook up about it. “I was trying to get into the kitchen because Nan said there were towels at the washing machine. “They were pretty damp so I just threw them over it. “After we put the fire out, we sat on the wall and waited for thefiremen.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead.

Danielle Smith, , used a metal pole to shatter windows of a home on Ness Glen Road, Dalmellington on November , . But she didn’t act alone as Smith was spotted alongside a male when the pair terried their targets inside. Ayr Sherf Court heard he appeared to be carrying a black air rle. But Smith, of Castle Croft, Dalmellington, admitted shoving the barrel of the rle into the home. And the victims inside cowered in fear as they could hear Smith shouting “Get out here, get our here.” CCTV footage captured the pair on their threatening violent spree. Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window. Police were called and discovered the metal pole used by Smith the following morning. A search warrant in Smith’s home uncovered pellets for an air rle in a box within her bedroom.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion.ldquoPeople have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8712633.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scrapping-glasgow-airport-rail-link-a-betrayal-labour-claim","story":"Glasgow Labour leader Frank McAveety made the comments after alternative proposals were announced last week for a shuttle pod system built to run between the airport and Paisley Gilmour Street instead.A direct rail link to Glasgow was announced as part of thepound. billion Glasgow City Region deal agreed in  and was expected to be operational by .After several delays and concerns over rail capacity at Glasgow Central station, it was indicated dferent options would be explored.Mr McAveety, former chairman of the City Region Cabinet, which progressed the plans, said the SNP should stop ldquodragging their feet over construction of an airport link.ldquoWhat has Glasgow done to deserve this  Mr McAveety asked.ldquoThis is the second time that Glasgow has had its rail link project axed by the SNP.ldquoGlasgow is one of few cities of its size that does not have a dedicated rail link to its airport.ldquoThis is a betrayal for the city.

The art of place-making was all but dead, as was the skill of creating genuine communities rather than rather soulless housing estates, until I determined to revive these timeless skills over  years ago.

But the work they do in rigorously researching and testing not only how the electorate thinks but, crucially, why it thinks that way, is crucial. Such organisations bring proper depth and understanding to political thinking, paving the way for better policies.Marianne Taylor: Brexit reveals Germanys unrequited love for UKAnd never has Scotland been more in need of rigorous thinking than now. The terrible situation we find ourself in, about to be ripped from the European Union against our will and plunged off the no-deal clf, wilfully ignored by a robotic Prime Minister most focused on keeping her partyrsquos fringe extremists happy, demands action. Or at least options, and independence remains the most obvious.The moral and democratic case for independence gets stronger and clearer by the day as the grim inability of Westminster to deal with the gravity of the situation plays out. On one side of the house you have a Tory party gone rogue, prepared to abandon its own fundamental principles and trash the country economically, socially and culturally in the name of a glorious English past that never was.On the opposition benches, meanwhile, you have a bafflingly ideological and ineffectual Labour party willing to harm the very people it claims to represent by allowing this madness to go unchecked. No wonder the partyrsquos membership in Scotland has noseed by  per cent in the last year.The perfect storm indeed. Some in Scotland - certainly those who shout the loudest on social media - would have you believe it is also the perfect time for another independence referendum. But as the democratic case for Scotland leaving the UK strengthens, the economic arguments are harder than ever to make.If an independent Scotland was a hard sell in  with both sides of the border inside the EU, the possible and probable consequences of the current stalemate are mindboggling. Imagine the economic ramications for an independent Scotland inside the EU, while its next door neighbour and biggest trading partner is outside the customs union, making tarfs necessary on every product or service that crosses what would quite possibly have to be a hard border. Then throw into the mix that they donrsquot use the same currency. All this may be happening to a Scotland and England already economically traumatised by the aftermath of a hard Brexit. Could Scots be persuaded to vote to potentially make themselves poorer in the short-term to achieve longer term prosperity  The Leave campaign persuaded a majority in England and Wales to largely ignore economics in , of course.Marianne Taylor: Brexit reveals Germanys unrequited love for UKThen therersquos the fact that referendums themselves have become the stuff of nightmares for many of us. The last two years of chaos and ision have shown that a close result on independence ndash say - in favour ndash could potentially be just as disastrous. The anger and disgust felt by many, meanwhile, at the Westminster class only highlights the distrust most of us feel towards all politicians. They have betrayed us.One can only imagine, of course, how the newly souped-up, Brexit-ed UK would look to thwart Scotlandrsquos independent ambitions. The arrogance and disrespect with which the UK Government has already dealt with the EU and Holyrood tells you much. And look at what is happening to Northern Ireland ultimately the Tory party has shown itself willing to sacrice peace,thatrsquos what it takes to achieve Brexit. Imagine how it would seek to punish Scotlandit tried to leave the union.When will Scots be ready to even contemplate another political upheaval  It wonrsquot be any time soon,you ask me, and certainly not until we believe there are sensible alternatives on the ballot paper.Marianne Taylor: Brexit reveals Germanys unrequited love for UKIrsquom not saying Scotland shouldnrsquot or wonrsquot be able to choose a dferent future for itself.

strategy","story":"Aberdeenshire residents will be encouraged to become recycling champions with the introduction of a controversial three-weekly collection programme.The revised waste strategy for all , properties in the Shire was approved in a - vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste bin.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch

only four natural ingredients – Scottish water, barley, hops and yeast.With an ABV of %, the lager is described as mildly aromatic and refreshing, with a crisp, dry taste, medium carbonation.Experienced brewer Neil Stirton joined the team last year and has been overseeing the brewing process.He said: “The cold temperatures of Scotland make it an ideal location for using the traditional Baian method of brewing.“Some of the base ingredients were sourced from Germany but as up to % of the ingredients in the brewing process is water, we wanted to ensure that the product was brewed in Scotland, using % Scottish water.“Water has a key role in the flavour and final quality of the product due to the fact the mineral content of water can be altered according to the requirements of the beer style being brewed.“This takes a lot of skill and we have worked hard to get TORR Lager just right before the official launch.”TORR is now available on draught and in ml

wanted to create a Scottish lager which uses Scottish water and reflects the pure, clean air of our mountains.“We know that people tend to drink considerably more lager than beer or craft ales so we

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to.

However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

But all are nasty, evil and damaging to those on the receiving end.At its worst, abuse can undermine the human rights of the people – usually, but not exclusively, women – who are subjected to it.One of the worst forms of domestic violence is sexual.Here in the UK we tend to think that we are alert to the dangers.As a society we believe that we abhor, and fight at every opportunity, to expose and excise abuse, of every iation.But just recently we were given a stark rebuke.

That women in this part of our country do not have the benefit of the same rights and protection of the law as the rest of us.If that was not bad enough,any of us, or our daughters, should move to that other part of the UK we would lose the rights we were born with.

But it is.The UK Supreme Court concluded that Northern Ireland’s abortion law is incompatible with human rights.: Nicola Sturgeon urged to back efforts to legalise abortion in Northern IrelandThe United Nations stated that the UK is violating the rights of women in Northern Ireland by restricting their access to abortion.To be clear, this is not an argument about the rights and wrongs of abortion, but of human rights. It is about whether people in every part of the UK enjoy the same basic rights.Before Parliament at the moment is an opportunity to address that inequality. But so far it remains untaken.And more often than not the excuse given is one that I find particularly hard to swallow: devolution.In each of the debates that I have been part of on this issue, the fact of the legislative existence of Stormont has been used as an excuse.The argument regularly made – and one I would normally agree with – is that devolved areas should not be interfered with.In this case, however, I am often left incredulous by those who say that while they recognise the situation is unacceptable and the law is in need of reform we shouldn’t interfere, even though Northern Ireland does not, at the moment have a working devolved legislature.That offends my sense of justice.When they have been asked, the majority of people in Northern Ireland have agreed that Westminster should step in.: Jacob Rees-Mogg: Easing NI abortion law would ‘damage the Union’Surely the people of Northern Ireland have a right to expect the same human rights as their fellow citizens in every other part of the UK I would expect no less for any of us in Scotland, although I am sure that we would never need that redress and certainly in this area the law in Scotland is already enacted.To be clear this is not, for me, simply about this Domestic Abuse Bill.Yes, Northern Ireland has the most restrictive abortion law in Europe with a near blanket ban, even for cases where there is a medical reason. And that is certainly central to the argument.This week Belfast high Court began hearing the case of a woman, Sarah Ewart, who was denied an abortion even though she was told her unborn baby had a fatal condition. She was forced to borrow money to make the journey to the UK for an abortion.Since , more than , women and girls have travelled to another country for an abortion. In , , made that traumatic journey.Sarah Ewart has the support of Northern Ireland’s human rights commission and of MPs like myself who last year voted to force Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to explain how officials can continue to enforce the ban.However, in Parliament, this has become about which should be more important: a constitutional argument or the human rights of the population.For me the people, not the constitution or national identity, should come first.Devolution, as I argued in the Commons, means that areas of legislation are delegated, or transferred to another authority.It should not mean that the UK Government abrogates all responsibility for the welfare of UK citizens or that it should not step up to resolve an injustice that is being done to some or any of our people, when there is no other body to fight their corner.And neither should those of us in areas with devolved authorities use it as a defence against helping others. Indeed, not only has the UN argued that is the case, two-thirds of adults in Northern Ireland have agreed that, without their own devolved government, Westminster should act to change the law.In parliament this week I felt for Conservative minister Victoria Atkins MP, a barrister in her former career, who had to make the Government’s argument that women in Northern Ireland could not have the protection of the Domestic Abuse Bill currently going through parliament because it is a devolved area.Ms Atkins obviously feels as passionately as any of us that domestic abuse must be tackled but could not accept the case that it should be extended to Northern Ireland in the absence of a working executive there. There is currently a private members’ bill going through parliament, which I have backed, aimed at tackling the same issue.And there have been several recent attempts to change the law over what should and, in a better world, would be the private healthcare concern of the inidual women concerned.For the moment at least, it seems that those who fail to overcome the roadblocks to re-establishing devolution in Northern Ireland also fail to protect the rights of its women.Surely it’s time the rest of us took responsibility.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4867335.1549294629!/image/image.jpg","title":"john swinney was opposed to workplace parking plan","story":"The Scottish Government is facing growing pressure to spell out how a controversial new charging regime for Scots to park at work will operate.It has emerged that senior SNP figures, including Deputy First Minister John Swinney, have previously opposed such a proposal.The Tories now say the scheme could \"fall apart\" before it has even begun.Read more: The SNP’s Car Tax is a Poll Tax on wheels - Brian MonteithThe workplace parking levy was among a suite of new taxes unveiled last week as a part of a budget deal with the Scottish Greens.But its has prompted a backlash among business leaders and motoring organisations with concerns that commuters could now be charged as much as £ a year to park at work.NHS staff will be exempt, but it remains unclearteachers will be excluded or whether it applies to blue-badge holders and emergency service workers.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4866978.1549266146!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon uk not remotely prepared for brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The UK is #not remotely prepared# for Brexit and the process must be delayed, Nicola Sturgeon will warn in a keynote speech in the US today.The First Minister will step up calls for a second referendum with just  days left until the UK is due to formally leave the European Union.Prime Minister Theresa May insisted yesterday that Brexit will happen “on time” as she prepared toto Brussels seeking changes to the Irish backstop, a sticking point of her EU Withdrawal Deal which has been rejected by the Commons.But she faced a warning from the Irish deputy prime minister that “there are no credible alternative arrangements” to the proposal.She was also stung by the announcement that Japanese car giant Nissan has axed plans to make its X-Trail x vehicle in Sunderland, citing several reasons including Brexit uncertainty.Ms Sturgeon will launch a broadside at the turmoil engulfing Westminster over Brexit and insist that Scotland’s interests have been treated as an “afterthought” in a speech in Washington, DC today.“The UK is not remotely prepared to leave the EU in  days’ time,” Ms Sturgeon will say. “The UK government should finally recognise that, and it should ask the EU to agree to put back the planned date for Brexit.”Such a request would have to be backed up by an “achievable plan”, with Ms Sturgeon suggesting the UK government could reconsider plans to leave the single market and customs union. She will tell her audience at Georgetown University that a “better option is to hold a further referendum on EU membership”. “The Scottish Government’s view is that this issue should be put back to the people,” the First Minister will say on the first day of a trade mission to the US and Canada.“That no Scottish Parliament, of any political composition, would approach Brexit in the way that the UK government has helps to explain why Brexit is also relevant to the debate on Scottish independence.“In the independence referendum in , voters in Scotland were repeatedly told thatwe became independent, we would have to leave the European Union. Voting to stay in the UK was portrayed as the way to protect our EU membership. That in itself raises the question of whether decisions about Scotland should continue to be taken at Westminster or whether it would be betterthey were taken in Scotland. And now the ongoing chaos at Westminster and the way Scotland’s interests have been consistently ignored makes that question even more relevant. “So I have said I will outline my thoughts on the timing of a possible independence referendum in the next few weeks, once the terms of Brexit are clearer. But, amid the chaos, confusion and uncertainty of Brexit, one thing is clearer than ever. Namely, that Scotland’s vital national interests are not properly served by relying on the Westminster system which treats Scotland as an afterthought, and that those interests can only properly be served by being an independent country.”But writing in a weekend newspaper article, Mrs May insisted the departure date will not change and that she would “deliver Brexit on time”.The EU Withdrawal Agreement she struck with Brussels was rejected by the Commons over the Irish backstop provision which is aimed at keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic open after Brexit.She said: “When Ito Brussels … I will be armed with a fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution that delivers the Brexit the British people voted for, while ensuring there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.”Last week Mrs May secured Parliament’s backing to go back to Brussels in the hope of hammering out a fresh agreement that does not include the backstop – which is unacceptable to the DUP and Brexiteer Tories – and which will command a Commons majority.The Prime Minister is due to report back to Parliament on  February, with a further series of votes by MPs expected the following day.However, there was a was warning for Mrs May that she may be opposed by her own Eurosceptic backbenchersthe deal she gets falls short of their expectations.European Research Group deputy chairman Steve Baker tweeted that there could be “trouble ahead” and suggested changes to the backstop may not satisfy them. “Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI [Northern Ireland] but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement,” he wrote.It came as a senior Nissan boss blasted Brexit “uncertainty” as he confirmed the company had scrapped plans to build the X-Trail x at its Sunderland plant.Gianluca de Ficchy, the Japanese firm’s Europe chairman, said the decision had been taken for “business reasons” affected by rules on diesel engines and reduced sales.The announcement that the X-Trail would be built in Japan was made in a letter to staff that followed a day of political rows between Brexit supporters and opponents over the reason for one of Wearside’s largest employers going against a  decision to build the car there.In the letter, Mr de Ficchy also said: “Clearly the uncertainty around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4867605.1549297775!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll half of voters back delaying brexit to negotiate new deal","story":"Almost half of voterswould back delaying Brexit beyond the scheduled date of March  to allow time to negotiate a better deal, according to a new poll.With just  days remaining to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, just % said they would oppose a delay for this purpose.Those questioned for the monthly YouGov tracker poll for The Times also backed postponing Brexit to give more time to make preparations for a no-deal departure, by a margin of %-%.But they opposed a delay to hold a general election by %-% or a second referendum by %-% and were almost evenly spliton whether the Government should seek more time to get Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement through.Some % of those questioned said that MPs were right to back the so-called Brady Amendment, offering Parliament’s support for the agreement so long as the controversial backstop arrangement for the Irish border is removed. -

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a lsquosafety netrsquo it ensures that you canhomeyoursquore stranded abroad and that your money is safe.Pay for your holiday by credit cardPorsche vandalised in KenilworthTravelling after Brexit - how it impacts data roaming and driving abroad Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"ldquoDonrsquot lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fundraiser in memory of limestone mother","story":"A FUNDRAISING night will be held this Saturdayin memory of a North Belfast woman who died suddenly just two weeks after she became a grandmother for the first time.Marie Branfdied suddenly at her Limestone Road home on St Patrick’s Day  after suffering a heart attack and going into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just . We need to keep funding research so that more lives can be saved.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mates pull pensioner from blaze","story":"A RIVERDALE man has recounted the dramatic moments when he and a friend saved two of his neighbours from a blaze that gutted their home.Antoin Carlisle and Terence Young saved an elderly woman in her s and a man in his s from the house fire in Riverdale Park South around .am on Saturday morning. After noticing smoke billowing from the property, the brave pair sprang into action, racing towards the fire to bring the people inside to safety.Recounting the dramatic ordeal, Antoin told us: “I couldn’t see the fire, so I thought it was the end house on my street. As soon as we got to the end of the street we could see the flames through the back windows – the whole lot was on fire.“Nobody lives in the house next door so I kicked in that door thinking somebody had broken in and set it on fire. Then I came round and hit the other door a boot and the fire nearly blew me off my feet.“I started smashing windows to let the smoke out. I smashed the front window and then climbed up and smashed one of the top windows and shouted at the top of my lungs, ‘Is anybody there ’“We found out there were people at the back of the house. We couldn’t get in the front because the flames were too big, so we went to the old couple next door, got them settled, and then my mate Terence started breaking down the fence with his shovel to get into the house. He got in the back way and lted the two people out of the house and out through the broken fence.“The smoke was all over the place so I thought all the houses were going to go up. I went to the houses on the other side and got them up. My neighbour had one of the kids and I had to bring the other one up the street to get them away from the smoke – I was trying to keep my hand over the child’s face to stop them breathing in the smoke. The black smoke was following us the whole way up.”Antoin added: “I think most people would have done it. I just did it because it was my own neighbours. I knew there were old people in those houses so I had to do something. When it’s your own street you can’t just walk past it. I have to thank my friend Terence too becausehe wasn’t here then God knows what would have happened.”A spokesperson for the Fire Servicesaid: “Firefighters were called to a house fire on the ground floor of a two storey, mid-terraced property. A man in his s and a woman in her s were out of the property before the arrival of fire crews. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire.“Both casualties were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and shock and taken to hospital. An elderly neighbour was also treated at the scene and taken to hospital. The cause of the fire is believed to be accidental.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcdaid double ends stars cup hopes","story":"Irish Cup Sixth RoundLarne Crumlin Star A SECOND half brace from David McDaid crushed Crumlin Star#s dreams of a place in the last eight of the Irish Cup as runaway Championship One leaders, Larne fought back from a goal down to claim the win at a sunny and cold Inver Park on Saturday.The Ardoyne side dared to dream when Joe McNeill put them into the lead on  minutes, but the hosts drew level on  thanks to a Jeff Hughes header and after the break, they went ahead when McDaid converted what looked a harshly awarded penalty after Hughes# shot hit the arm of Ciaran Hughes and the ex-Cltonville striker make sure of victory with a late goal.Star were far from disgraced in this game and their large support could be proud of their team#s efforts on the day as they put it up to the Premiership-bound opposition who were laden with players who have played at the top level including former Reds in McDaid, Martin Donnelly, Tomás Cosgrove and Conor Devlin.In front of a big crowd that added to the occasion, the visitors opened with confidence and two minutes in, Devlin had to get down to his right to claw Barry McKervey#s free-kick around the post for a corner that led to a shot from Mark Lyons flying wide right.Larne gradually got to grips with the early pressure and looked to move the ball quickly in order to find gaps in the Star defence.Their first chance fell to McDaid who didn#t get hold of his shot and it was easily saved by Shane Harrison.On nine minutes, Martin Donnelly weaved his way past a number of challenges from the right and found himself just yards out, but he elected to place his shot rather than put power behind it with the goal at his mercy and Harrison was able to get down to stop it and get his behind for a corner that was aimed at the back post, but McDaid headed just too high.Star remained a threat and were always looking to create an opening # something they did to perfection on  minutes when brothers, Aidan and Joe McNeill combined to perfection with Aidan playing a perfectly-weighted ball in behind the Larne defence with Joe beating Devlin to the ball and lted it over the goalkeeper and into the net to send the away support into raptures.The pressure was now on Larne and they bombarded Star in search for the equaliser.Patrick McNally # a replacement for the injured Shane McEleney # headed over from Tomás Cosgrove#s shot and Cosgrove then saw his shot at the near post saved.The hosts were getting closer and on  minutes, the goal came when Hughes rose to meet Donnelly#s corner from the right and thundered a header high into the net.The momentum was with Larne and Donnelly then saw his brilliant free-kick saved onto the post and cleared by Harrison, while on the stroke of half-time, Cosgrove#s curling effort from the edge of the box went just outside the post with the goalkeeper beaten.With the sides level at the break, it was all to play for and both tried to establish themselves early in the second period.Chances were thin on the ground with Larne#s Jeff Hughes hooking a th minute effort well off target, but they really should have gone ahead on  minutes when Cosgrove cut in on the left and rolled a good ball across the face of goal to McNally a couple of yards from goal, but he inexplicably lted the ball over when it looked much easier to score.Larne did get their noses in front on  minutes from McDaid#s penalty, but Star certainly felt the award was hard as Hughes# shot at goal seemed to just hit the arm of Burns who had no time to get out of the way, but a spot-kick was the decision of referee Shane Andrews and McDaid made no mistake, firing high into the net.Star now needed a goal, but they were unable to carve out any clear chances with Larne looking to put the game away and Martin Donnelly had a couple of chances, but couldn#t find the goal his performance deserved.Instead, it was left to McDaid who swept home in the final minute from Lee Lynch#s cross from the right to seal his side#s passage into the quarter-final.LARNE: C Devlin, C Ramsey, T Cosgrove, J Hughes, L Lynch, S McEleney , F Sule, G Kelly, B Tiney , M Donnelly , D McDaid.

I believe that the work that I set out to do is completed and that RRCANI now has a good foundation which they can continue to build on.”She added: “It is amazing what we all achieved in a relatively short period of time, most times relying just on friendships and a lot of good will. A heartfelt thank you and very well done to you all. I hope you will continue the good work with the Roma communities.”Remarkably, recipients of the email include her line manager at LORAG and the community group’s CEO Gerard Rice – both of whom Ms Long now claims were aware of her concerns. Both say they were not alerted to any concerns with the project until issues were raised by the Belfast Trust in late May .Another recipient of the email is her then fellow LORAG worker in the RRCANI project, spokesman for the Roma community of Belfast, Nicolae Nicola. Ms Long now says that he was the person charging vulnerable Roma for services, a claim which remains unproven and which Mr Nicola vehemently denies. Also copied into the email is Ms Long’s husband, Stephen Long.LORAG Chairperson John Gormley said: “We reject the claim that was broadcast on the Nolan show. LORAG had previously told the BBC Nolan Show that the first we became aware of an allegation of charging by RRCANI was through a conversation on or about  May  with Belfast Health and Social Care Trust officials. We were funded from June  to March  to provide mentoring and capacity-building support to RRCANI, in partnership with other agencies. At no time during the funding period was any allegation of charging by RRCANI made to LORAG by any of the other partners or by any LORAG staff member.”We contacted Ms Long via email but no response had been received as we went to press."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37779561.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/3301984-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"dups foster calls for brussels to talk about brexit backstop alternatives","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He will be closely engaged throughout the process.\" Meanwhile, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald yesterday repeated her partys stance that the backstop is the \"absolute bare minimum... the bottom line\" required.Speaking on the BBCs Andrew Marr show, Mrs McDonald said the backstop is essential to the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in \"all of its parts\".\"That is why a backstop, or a set of very specic protections were landed on,\" she said. \"They are minimal, but they are the absolute bare necessities to ensure that our economy, that our society and crucially our peace agreement isnt disrupted.\"Addressing the prospect of a border poll, she said Sinn Fein would \"prepare for the worst scenario and protect our national interest\".Her comments yesterday were made less than  hours after she told a gathering of party activists in Dublin that the unionist community needs to start \"preparing for Irish unity\".Meanwhile, Tanaiste Simon Coveney has again stated the EUs position that the withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated. Writing in the Sunday Times, he said the decision by MPs last Tuesday to agree to seek alternative backstop arrangements had caused \"disappointment and dismay\" in the Republic and Europe.Mr Coveney added that no \"credible\" options have been put forward as yet, but stressed the EU is \"committed to trying to agree alternative arrangements to replace the backstop\" once the withdrawal agreement is ratied.He warned that dispensing with the withdrawal agreement would have serious consequences for Northern Ireland.\"It is now time for the UK to keep its word, to deliver on these commitments and on its responsibilities,\" he said.The hardening of the EU position comes as the Prime Minister - who pledged yesterday that she is determined to agree a \"pragmatic solution\" that delivers Brexit - prepares to s to Brussels for further negotiations next Wednesday."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37779557.ece/89d40/AUTOCROP/w620h342/_1CZ6JF-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"nissan scraps its plans to build xtrail at sunderland plant","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The announcement that the X-Trail would be built in Japan was made in a letter to staff that followed a day of political rows between Brexit supporters and opponents over the reason for one of Wearsides largest employers reneging on a  decision to build the car there. In yesterdays letter, Mr de Ficchy said: \"Todays announcement will be interpreted by a lot of people as a decision related to Brexit. \"We have taken this decision for the business reasons Ive explained, but clearly the uncertainty around the UKs future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The Conservatives botched negotiations and threat of a no-deal Brexit is causing uncertainty and damaging Britains economy.\" And Sharon Hodgson, the areas Labour MP, said: \"This is a great loss of future investment in Sunderland and I am sure that people will share my huge disappointment and concern at this news. \"Tomorrow I will be seeking answers from Government ministers as a matter of urgency\". The announcement came as two senior Cabinet ministers rejected the idea of the UK remaining in a customs union as the price of getting a Brexit deal. Labour wants the UK to remain in some sort of customs union as part of a withdrawal agreement. But Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he believed Tory backbenchers would kill off such a plan evenit received Labour support in the Commons. And International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, asked on Skys Ridge on Sundayhe could \"stomach\" a customs union to achieve a deal, simply said: \"No.\" Their interventions came after Theresa May had said she would be \"battling for Britain\" when she s to Brussels to seek a \"pragmatic\" Brexit deal that can win over both the European Union and her own MPs. Writing in the Sunday , she suggested that Labour leader Mr Corbyn had agreed with her that the Irish border backstop as set out in the withdrawal agreement had to change. However, Mrs May was warned she may be opposed by her own Eurosceptic backbenchersthe deal she gets falls short of their expectations. European Research Group deputy chairman Steve Baker tweeted that there could be \"trouble ahead\" and suggested changes to the backstop may not satisfy them. \"Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NIbut with grave misgivings about the whole agreement,\" he wrote. \"Now the PM co-opts us into accepting everything but the backstop and, on the backstop, accepting a codicil. \"The right way forward is the Malthouse Compromise. \"If all we see is a codicil - a joint interpretative instrument - expect a further substantial defeat for the agreement.\" Mr Javid also denied reports that Downing Street was planning a summer general election. He told Andrew Marr that the Tories were only planning for a local election to take place in May as planned, adding: \"I think the last thing this country needs is a general election.\""},{"url":null,"title":"another outcome to withdrawal agreement not realistic dutch foreign minister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But we recognise there is a need for a backstop at this stage of the exercise.”His comments come as Labour has faced calls to clary its position on the contentious issue.Whilst we have got concerns that we have set out about the backstop, we do accept the principle that there has got to be a backstopSir Keir StarmerFacebookTwitterLast week, Labour MPs were whipped to vote against a Westminster amendment calling for “alternative arrangements” to replace the backstop.However, last week party leader Jeremy Corbyn also said he had a “problem” with the backstop proposal, insisting it was unacceptable that the UK could not unilaterally decide to withdraw from it.The purpose of the backstop arrangement is to ensure the Irish border remains open, evena wider trade deal between the UK and EU fails to materialise at the end of the Brexit transition period.It would effectively see the whole UK continue to adhere to the customs union, while Northern Ireland would also align with EU single market regulations on goods, meaning it would operate under a dfering legal framework to Great Britain.On Monday, Sir Keir met business and trade union leaders in Belfast, as well as leadership figures from Sinn Fein and the SDLP.He told the Press Association: “The Prime Minister has effectively run down the clock and therefore it is impossible to see a way forward without a backstop.“So, whilst we have got concerns that we have set out about the backstop, we do accept the principle that there has got to be a backstop.”Sir Keir said he did not believe Theresa May would succeed in agreeing an alternative to the backstop with the EU, stating: “The Prime Minister and her team have spent over  months trying to find an alternative to the backstop.“We have only got the backstop because they couldn’t find an alternative.“So for her to go back now saying, ‘I don’t want the backstop, I want an alternative’ is to stand the last  months on its head.“And I think that’s what is causing the anxiety because nobody realistically thinks she’s going to succeed in that objective.”After the meeting with the shadow Brexit secretary at the Europa Hotel, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said he had brought “clarity” to Labour’s position.It was important today to put to Keir Starmer that we need to see clarity from the Labour Party on the backstop. He did say in the meeting that the backstop is inevitable and that is the Labour positionMichelle ONeill, Sinn FeinFacebookTwitterShe suggested that during their meeting Sir Keir acknowledged that Labour had previously not been clear and consistent on the need for a backstop.“It was important today to put to Keir Starmer that we need to see clarity from the Labour Party on the backstop,” she said.“He did say in the meeting that the backstop is inevitable and that is the Labour position.“It’s their position because they understand the need to ensure there’s no hard border on this island.”She added: “The words he used to ourselves in the meeting today were clearly that a backstop is inevitable – that is the Labour position in order to protect or guard against a hard border and I can only say that that’s what he’s relayed to us.”Ms O’Neill said it was important that Sir Keir heard first hand “very clearly and directly” the need to protect the backstop.She described the backstop as the “least worst option” but nevertheless she said the Irish government and the EU needed to stand firm against the UK Government’s attempts to alter the Withdrawal Agreement.“The backstop is a legal guarantee,” she said.“There’s no-one here who trusts the word of the British Government at this moment in time.”She added: “It has to be legal guarantees. The backstop is the bottom line.”DUP MP Gavin Robinson said Mr Starmers comments on the backstop showed the internal struggle inside the Labour party.He said: “Keir Starmer’s comments about “a backstop” are similar to those he made over a week ago during a television interview. Far from being borne out of any deep concern for Northern Ireland, they are part of an internal struggle inside the Labour Party.\"When he talks about a backstop being inevitable it is code for keeping the UK fully inside the Single Market and Customs Union. Others in the Labour Party, including Jeremy Corbyn seem to recognise that such an outcome would not reflect the referendum result.\"When he talks about Parliament asserting itself he conveniently ignores last week’s vote where Parliament has set a course for what it wants to see from the government in negotiations with the EU.\"Most concerning is that he has effectively said the only alternative to the current backstop is remaining inside the customs union and single market because the European Union haven’t offered anything  forward. For all Labour’s criticisms of the government’s negotiations it seems Keir Starmer is prepared to accept defeat without even entering any negotiation.\"Whilst Keir Starmer’s attention seems to be fixed on the leadership of the Labour Party, the real focus should be on the European Union. They have already acknowledged that alternatives to the backstop will have to be found, but at the moment they refuse to negotiate until after th March. The focus should be on Brussels and starting meaningful negotiation immediately.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what is the malthouse compromise","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Plan A is similar to the current Withdrawal Agreement, but with changes to the Irish backstop and the implementation period. Plan B assumes that agreement on the Withdrawal Agreement is not possible and creates a “transitional standstill period”.– How is plan A dferent to the current deal on offer The bare bones of the Withdrawal Agreement remain the same, but the implementation period would be extended until no later than December . The aim of this is to provide a longer period to agree the future relationship, but it could also involve paying more money to the EU.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins.

He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Glasgow Airport Rail Link project has undergone review after review.ldquoOur city is growing year-on-year and continues to be the powerhouse of the Scottish economy.ldquoItrsquos time the SNP stopped dragging their feet, put the Glasgow Airport Rail Link project back on track and invested in the railway network that our city needs.Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said she would continue to listen to concerns raised by transport professionals over the viability of a rail link.ldquoImproving connectivity to Glasgow Airport is a key priority and one Irsquom absolutely committed to, she said.ldquoHowever, serious doubts remain about the viability of the option Mr McAveety continues to champion, about major detrimental impacts upon the daily running of the countryrsquos biggest railway station and whether tram-train financially stacks up.ldquoCouncillor McAveety would prefer that I give up on finding a workable solution, close my ears to the repeated concerns from transport professionals and take a massive risk with valuable public finances and our wider transport network.

You will understand of course that this figure will be subject to business cases being developed, which are independently assessed, and the usual processes of due diligence.ldquoIt is contingent too on a positive decision by the Nissan Board to allocateproduction of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant. We recognise that the UK has a stake, and we are backing your continued success in Sunderland to the hilt.The letter was published a day after Nissan announced it would not be building its X-Trail car in Sunderland.The company said the decision was taken for business reasons, but made clear that continued uncertainty around the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU was not helping it plan for the future.The letter was sent to Nissan chief executive at the time, Carlos Ghosn Mr Clark said in his letter: ldquoThe Government fully recognises the signicance of the EU market to your presence in Sunderland. It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU.ldquoWe will set our ambitions high and vigorously pursue continued access to the European market as an objective in future negotiations.The development came after union leaders pressed Nissan for guarantees on jobs and future production.Officials from Unite met with management at the Sunderland plant and expressed their ldquoanger and disappointment over how the announcement over future production of the X-Trail was handled.Unite official Steve Bush said a ldquogreat deal of anxiety had been caused to the ,-strong workforce.He said guarantees had been given that future production of the Juke and Qashqai models were not affected.Mr Bush said: ldquoUnite will continue to press for further long-term guarantees over future investment and new models to secure the sitersquos future for generations to come.ldquoWhat this whole sorry saga shows is thatthe sector-wide uncertainty caused by Brexit urgently needs to be addressed by ministers because it is draining the industry of skills, investment and new jobs.ldquoThe Government also needs to get a grip and do more to support car workers and the industry in the transition away from diesel to alternatively powered vehicles.ldquoTrashing diesel while pulling the plug on grants which help people buy electric and alternatively powered vehicles serves only to confuse customers and the industry.An offer of grants totalling pound million was made to Nissan in June , Mr Clark revealed today.The Business Secretary said in a letter to Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Select Committee, that a package of support included skills, research and development and innovation.Mr Clark said that when he appeared before the committee in December , there were aspects of his letter to Nissan that were commercially confidential.ldquoFurther to my discussions with Nissan on Friday and over the weekend, I understand that the commercial confidentialities for Nissan are now reduced, he wrote..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government offered Nissan up to  xAm in  to build new cars in UK article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a lsquosafety netrsquo it ensures that you canhomeyoursquore stranded abroad and that your money is safe.Pay for your holiday by credit cardldquoDonrsquot lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead.

According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
