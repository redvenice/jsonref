A little boy called Willem Fogle. He was my little son. Stillborn at 8 months. A little boy I never got to know. A little life that never got to live. A breath that was never exhaled.          Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds. She also posted a picture of Fogle (left) and his team          Fogle\u0027s climbing partner Victoria Pendleton (right) was forced to abandon the trek earlier this month on medical grounds\u0027His loss changed our lives and I think about him daily. Losing my little boy made me re-evaluate life. Not only do we hold our two beautiful children closer to us but it was a reminder to live life for the now. Don\u0027t waste it.\u0027 The trip was not without problems. He had to scale the final 2,700ft, known as the \u0027death zone\u0027, alone after his climbing partner, Pendleton, was forced to abandon the challenge.TV star Ben Fogle and ex-Olympian Victoria Pendleton start...TV adventurer Ben Fogle and former Olympic cyclist Victoria...Share this articleThe Olympic cyclist began suffering from the effects of hypoxia - oxygen deficiency - at Camp 2, 6,400 metres above sea level, and required additional oxygen to alleviate her symptoms.The double gold Olympic cyclist cheered on the team lead by experienced mountaineer, Kentoon Cool, from the side lines and posted her congratulations online when they finished: \u0027Congratulations to @benfogle@kentoncool Mark @fishercreative and the team for reaching the summit of Mount Everest thanks to @anythingispossible.world in support of @britishredcross #believe #everest2018\u0027.

Never. There is a spirituality but I can also feel the support and the love here on Instagram. There have been so many lovely messages.           Fogle offered to cancel his own ascent in solidarity but Pendelton insisted he continue to the summit with the others\u0027I am sorry that I haven\u0027t been able to reply to you all but I promise you I read your messages and once this adventure is over I will endeavour to reply to you all.\u0027Cradling little Willem to say goodbye, I made a promise to him to live my life brightly. To embrace everyday. To always smile. To be positive and to inspire. In some ways I am now living my life for two. \u0027Willem is always there. I think he is my guardian angel here. There is one particular star that shines brighter. It draws my attention. It reflects off the snow and ice. I feel so lucky. I will never take life for granted but above all I\u0027ll never be alone.\u0027          Pendleton, from Stotfold in Bedfordshire, admitted in December that she was taking part in the challenge because she was \u0027probably having a midlife crisis\u0027 Ben Fogle on Instagram: “A thank you to YOU ALL from the summit of the world @britishredcross @anythingispossible.world @unenvironment”"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/11/4C58CACC00000578-5739861-image-a-13_1526552773853.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles trusted circle Pictures women friends fly UK big day","story":"    While her family tears itself apart in the days before her wedding, Meghan Markle can at least rely on her trusted girl squad who have flown to the UK for her big day.

I’d done a student film for her when we were in university together, so she gave him the film the next day.‘He called me and said, “You’re going to make money, and I want to take 10 per cent”.

It\u0027s just a little sexist ...‘There needs to be a certain sense of equality where a woman is not just a plus-one, you know. It\u0027s nice to be your own identity, too.’But she appears to have accepted them as a team: in a recent poll published by Time magazine she hailed both Meghan and Harry as ‘leaders’.

It is thought she will meet the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the next 24 hours.On the night before the wedding she and her daughter will move with the bridal party to historic Cliveden, a 25-minute drive from Windsor Castle.It is widely thought that should her former husband, with whom she is said to be \u0027barely on speaking terms\u0027, fail to show, it will be Miss Ragland who has the task of walking her daughter down the aisle. Some royal insiders have also questioned whether Prince Charles might step in to do the honours.  How Meghan Markle\u0027s estranged family have turned the wedding into a VERY colourful affair Tracey Dooley, 52The recovering alcoholic, who sells advertising was once married to Meghan\u0027s half brother, Thomas Markle Jr.She was pictured arriving at Heathrow with her sons Tyler and Thomas, and are in the UK to conduct a round of interviews - even though she hasn\u0027t seen Meghan for around 20 years. She is documenting her stay in London on a Facebook page \u0027Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles\u0027 where she has uploaded a selection of pictures of famous landmarks.

And, naturally, he would receive an RSVP from the Palace, for he had ‘always supported her, she knows that’, he said, recalling how he had taken Meghan to feed the ducks and babysat for her when she was little.Oh yes — and there was bound to be ‘a plus-one for Darlene’, he added, glancing at his 36-year-old fiancée, perched at his burly shoulder and hanging on his every word.\u0027Why can\u0027t she just say she loves him?\u0027: Social media users...Does Harry need a wife or a mother? Diana¿s death left her...Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry...\u0027I have always cared for my father\u0027: Meghan breaks her...Share this article‘I would love to meet the Royals. I’d buy the prettiest dress,’ chirruped Darlene Blount, having, apparently, forgiven Thomas for drawing a gun on her less than three months earlier, during one of their drunken, violent quarrels.Fast forward 12 months and that two-hour conversation — which I listened to again yesterday on tape — sounds utterly surreal and, on reflection, rather sad. Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/14/4C661F4100000578-5742749-image-a-57_1526650912733.jpg","title":"Smiling fianc e flashing ring Meghan leaves family drama behind","story":"    Meghan Markle and Prince Harry smile and wave as they leave their Kensington Palace home to head to Windsor today.

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him. However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.    The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.          Police marksmen on the ground and on rooftops have to do \u0027whatever it takes\u0027 to keep people safe tomorrowIn return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.

Everyone will already know most of what to expect as the order of service is being released at midnight on Friday.1pmThe newlyweds will emerge about an hour later at the West Steps of the Chapel. They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St George’s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.The carriage procession through the streets of Windsor is expected to take about 25 minutes.7pmThe reception is not being televised and neither is the evening reception at Frogmore House, but viewers will get another glimpse of the royal couple when they leave Windsor Castle at 7pm for the evening do, which is hosted by the Prince of Wales.       Prince Charles, who walked family friend Alexandra Knatchbull down the aisle at her wedding in 2016, will step in for Thomas Markle, it was announced this morningThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points. Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrowArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million - which equates to around £12million today.Extra police from around Britain are being called upon to help ensure the event goes off without a hitch, as crowds will fill Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royals.  Since Prince William’s wedding the UK has experienced a surge in terror threats, meaning the cost of Harry’s nuptials outside of the city will be much higher.The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs. The Queen revealed has said she and the rest of the royal family will pay for the traditional wedding costs like the ceremony, flowers, music and the reception - but security is likely to be paid in full for by the taxpayer.             A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding            Crash barriers are also in place in Windsor to stop a terrorist attacking crowds using a vehicle  \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle.

Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week.

So, that\u0027s something to remember.\u0027I\u0027m sad. I think he was very good for Arsenal for maybe 12 to 15 years but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to organise our defence properly.

Both he and the Duchess (of Cornwall) have been encouraging for a number of years now.\u0027To channel the weight of heritage with the simple human easiness that he particularly demonstrates is an extraordinary feat and one of the reasons, as heads of state go, we\u0027ve got the best in the business.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C660FE400000578-0-image-m-70_1526652079593.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury praises Meghan Markle officiates wedding","story":"     The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (left) is pictured with American bishop Michael Curry (right) at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor today, ahead of the royal wedding tomorrowAsked about what he thinks of the Prince of Wales being chosen to walk Meghan Markle down the aisle, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Charles is \u0027someone of great care and affection\u0027.He added: \u0027He\u0027s a very warm person and that he\u0027s doing this is a sign of his love and concern and support.

There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportCrowds gather in Windsor to get view of royal wedding rehearsalHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal weddingYoko Ono and son Sean at launch of exhibition in LiverpoolSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Prince Harry goes to shake hand of mystery man in the crowdVideo shows fiery mushroom cloud from plane crash in HavanaIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.Royal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportCrowds gather in Windsor to get view of royal wedding rehearsalHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal weddingYoko Ono and son Sean at launch of exhibition in LiverpoolSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Prince Harry goes to shake hand of mystery man in the crowdVideo shows fiery mushroom cloud from plane crash in HavanaThe Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C657D1100000578-5745179-image-a-17_1526653536757.jpg","title":"Frail Yoko Ono visits John Lennons childhood homes Liverpool","story":"Yoko Ono visited Liverpool on Friday in order to open a new exhibition dedicated to her relationship with John Lennon before spending some time at two of his childhood homes, including Mendips (pictured)          Lennon moved to Mendips, at 251 Menlove Avenue, after his parents\u0027 marriage broke down.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

These momentous events always bring the entire elephant family together and we expect to see the other young calves in the group showing a lot of interest in the little one over the coming days, weeks and months.          Asian elephants, such as the newborn, are listed as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u0027s Red List. The birth is a \u0027huge boost\u0027 to conservation efforts\u0027Crucially, this is important news for Asian elephants more widely. The species is endangered in the wild. If we don\u0027t act now then the unthinkable could happen. By combining our breeding programme successes with field projects in the wild, we are really making a difference for these magnificent animals.\u0027The project at Chester Zoo has been working with conservationists in India for more than twelve years.They aim to prevent extinction in the wild by utilising the research produced in Chester.         A major project launched by the Zoo,  in Assam, northern India, has successfully eliminated conflict between local communities and the nearby Asian elephant population, offering a blueprint for the future conservation of the species.Scientists at the zoo are also researching a cure for the deadly disease which is threatening Asian elephants.There is currently no cure for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus, but scientists are hoping to produce a vaccine.           Thi gave birth to a healthy baby boy and keepers at the zoo say both mother and calf, who is yet to be named, are doing very well"},{"url":null,"title":"Royal Wedding guests bring food","story":"Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

A new Loony Left council. We’ve forgotten the lessons of history!I voted Remain. But to say our WWII troops were fighting for European values is insulting bunkum, writes DOMINIC SANDBROOK The era of hysteria! Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/18/4C6888F700000578-0-image-a-133_1526664553883.jpg","title":"Is African lodge called Shipwreck Prince Harry Meghan Markles honeymoon destination","story":"    Desolate: Shipwreck Lodge\u0027s design is based on the vessels washed up on the Namibian shoreAnd sources have told the Mail that £800-a-night Shipwreck Lodge, a new luxury hideaway in the remote spot, is being tipped as the couple’s venue of choice.

Instead, they’ll stay in the UK to attend Prince Charles’s 70th birthday celebrations on Tuesday. There are also plans for a trip to Dublin within weeks.          Luxury: Guest chalets at the lodge in Namibia feature breathtaking views of the oceanIndeed, their joint schedules are so busy over the coming months that some have predicted August is the earliest they will be able to escape. Last month, a local wrote on Facebook: ‘A little birdie told me that Prince Harry and Meghan are here for their honeymoon.’A spokesman for the lodge, Anica Britz, did not deny claims that Harry and Meghan might soon be jetting in, but said: ‘Unfortunately we cannot comment on or confirm the rumours that the royal couple will be staying at Shipwreck Lodge.’ Sources say Namibia – and the arresting landscape of the Skeleton Coast – is certainly top of Harry and Meghan’s list. Africa is a continent close to their hearts: both have done extensive charity and conservation work here and neighbouring Botswana was the location of one of their early dates, as well as a whirlwind holiday to mark Meghan’s 36th birthday last August. It will also appeal to their love of wildlife: Namibia is home to the world’s largest free-roaming black rhino population and Harry is a passionate animal-lover and anti-poaching campaigner.He has travelled to Namibia in the past. With ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, he canoed the Orange River in 2006 and missed Princess Charlotte’s christening in 2015 because he was working with rhino conservationists. Also said to be on the royal wish list is the enchanting opportunity to watch wildlife by moonlight at a waterhole in Ongava, a game reserve on the edge of the Etosha National Park. Visitors can watch leopards, rhinos, lions and zebras coming and going in near silence. Shipwreck Lodge, which is owned by the local government in conjunction with three upmarket travel agencies, has a number of activities on offer for any adventurous couple. Locals admit access is ‘tricky’ – making it perfect for this publicity-shy pair. Guests can charter a plane from the capital, Windhoek, or drive the five-and-a-half hours from Swakopmund to Mowe Bay themselves, after which the hotel provides guided 4x4s to cover the remaining two hours.          Insiders say builders are ‘frantically working to get it ready’ for the royal honeymoonersTheir nautically-themed accommodation features porthole windows and curved wooden beams.On the walls are vintage posters depicting the fates of vessels that have been wrecked, including the Dunedin Star – a cargo liner heading from Liverpool to Cape Town that ran aground in 1942.Day trips include excursions to the Mowe Bay seal colony, hyena-spotting at the Hoarusib River, sundowner cocktails in the spectacular dunes and treks to the homes of the nomadic Himba people.Rates rise to £1,450 in the August to mid-November peak season, although food and drink is included in the price, served by uniformed staff.

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married, William chose not to wear a wedding ring while Kate didIts popularity increased as the decades passed and as it became more fashionable for men to wear jewellery.In contrast to other royal men, the Prince of Wales does wear a wedding band, under a signet ring on the little finger of his left hand. There may be an element of social class at play for men who decide not to wear a wedding ring as those from the upper classes are said not to like jewellery.The Queen Mother began the tradition of royal wedding rings being made from Welsh gold after the precious metal was used to make her wedding band when she married in 1923.One nugget of gold was used to make the Queen Mother\u0027s wedding ring, the Queen\u0027s in 1947, Princess Margaret\u0027s in 1960, the Princess Royal\u0027s in 1973 and that of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981.  The Duke of Edinburgh, pictured on his wedding day in November 1947 with the then Princess Elizabeth, is from the generation which traditionally did not wear wedding ringsThe gold came from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine. There is now only a minute sliver, one gram (0.035oz), of the original nugget left.In November 1981, the British Royal Legion presented the Queen with a 36-gram (1.3oz) piece of 21-carat Welsh gold for future royal wedding rings.The Duchess of Cornwall\u0027s wedding ring was also crafted from Welsh gold from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine and the river Mawddach in the King\u0027s Forest.It was handmade in court style by Wartski and the precious metal was supplied by Cambrian Goldfields Limited."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/07/4C6AF5A000000578-5746935-image-a-3_1526712332086.jpg","title":"PICTURED Team florists getting church wedding ready stunning floral arrangements","story":"    Flowers and foliage surround the West Door of St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle today          Flowers adorn the front of the organ loft inside St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor this morning          Flowers and foliage surround the high altar of St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle todayToday, Meghan will be welcomed into the Royal Family surrounded by white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves, with branches of beech, birch and hornbeam.The floral array has been carefully crafted by Fulham-based floral designer - and the preferred supplier to Kensington Palace - Philippa Craddock.It was revealed in March that Ms Craddock had been hand-picked by the couple to deck out Windsor in stunning blooms for their nuptials today.Stand By Me, gospel choir, alternate vows and VERY modern...REVEALED: Meghan will enter Windsor chapel accompanied by...‘I can’t wait’!

A postcode search function has been added to the grocery section, which would tell potential customers whether food delivery is available in their area.The company has been running so-called soft trials of home delivery of food in Reading and Camden since the autumn. These could now be extended.Members of the chain\u0027s Sparks loyalty scheme members who live within a threemile radius of the Camden and Reading stores can select express delivery for £6.99 for 20 items or less within an hour of their online checkout, £1.99 for a one hour delivery slot, or a free click and collect service.          The chain has been looking at the idea for 10 years and, at one time, there were rumours of a partnership with Ocado, where the chairman is Lord Stuart Rose, who previously ran M\u0026ampSA source told the Grocer that the website changes could signal the start of a full rollout of an M\u0026ampS delivery service. The source said the lack of home food delivery was an \u0027obvious gap\u0027 and that shoppers consider such services a \u0027basic expectation\u0027.The source said: \u0027As M\u0026ampS\u0027 store numbers just aren\u0027t as high as other retailers, introducing this service could encourage more customers to shop at M\u0026ampS if it was made easier and more accessible for them.  \u0027It has quite a few hurdles to overcome to make this sustainable and economically viable, especially as shoppers don\u0027t tend to do full trolley shops at M\u0026ampS.\u0027 Another source said M\u0026ampS would be \u0027mad\u0027 to launch the service on the basis of the limited offer it currently has compared to mainstream supermarkets.          The company has been running so-called soft trials of home delivery of food in Reading and Camden since the autumn. These could now be extendedThey warned: \u0027Their margins will go south given how expensive delivery services are to run.\u0027 The M\u0026ampS chief executive, Steve Rowe, has accepted the retailer cannot afford to ignore the growing online grocery market, estimated to be worth £17.6bn by 2021.He is reported to have said at one internal meeting: \u0027We continue to review food online carefully. It has not cost us anything over the last five years by not being online with food. Our customers haven\u0027t moved yet, but they will and we need to ensure we are ready with the right response.\u0027 M\u0026ampS denied it was preparing to roll out a complete grocery delivery service."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/18/4C688EEE00000578-5745847-image-a-49_1526664659630.jpg","title":"Meghan Harry set Kensington Palace time royal wedding","story":"    Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel this evening      Make like Meghan in Roland Mouret bardot dressBuy now at FarfetchShe has just one more sleep to go until she marries Prince Harry, but Meghan Markle seemed to be as relaxed as always when she stepped out with her mother, Doria, at the Cliveden House Hotel where she will spend her last night as a bride-to-be before the big day tomorrow.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportCrowds gather in Windsor to get view of royal wedding rehearsalHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal weddingYoko Ono and son Sean at launch of exhibition in LiverpoolSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Prince Harry goes to shake hand of mystery man in the crowdVideo shows fiery mushroom cloud from plane crash in HavanaIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.Royal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportCrowds gather in Windsor to get view of royal wedding rehearsalHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal weddingYoko Ono and son Sean at launch of exhibition in LiverpoolSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Prince Harry goes to shake hand of mystery man in the crowdVideo shows fiery mushroom cloud from plane crash in HavanaThe Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C66A71000000578-0-image-m-42_1526655219722.jpg","title":"Dash cam footage shows shocking moment van pulls fully loaded 50 tonne HGV","story":"    Dash-cam footage shows the shocking moment a van overtook a fully loaded HGV before suddenly braking in front of it on the A50 in EnglandThe HGV motorist said: \u0027I was driving along the A50 fully loaded with timber weighing in at about 43.8 tonnes and with that weight, stopping has to be done with caution.\u0027When you consider a Ford Fiesta weighs about 1 tonne...I roarly want a go!

Yet both emerged as strong mothers described by their children as \u0027wonderful\u0027.Indeed, Princess Diana and Doria Ragland, one living in a palace in London, the other 5,500 miles away in a suburb of Los Angeles, even felt the same emotional urge to take their children to deprived areas where they could see just how difficult life was for those with virtually nothing.EXCLUSIVE: How Meghan Markle¿s ancestor was one of the...Princess Diana refused to wear Chanel shoes after orce...Share this articleBoth women married men who were 12 years their senior — and both marriages foundered.Diana, who would have been 57 on July 1 had she lived, was just 20 when she married the Prince of Wales at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral in 1981.Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979.All the dreams, hopes and ambitions that now face their children, Harry and Meghan, faced them.          Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

But to say our WWII troops were fighting for European values is insulting bunkum, writes DOMINIC SANDBROOK The era of hysteria! Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/18/4C6888F700000578-0-image-a-133_1526664553883.jpg","title":"Is African lodge called Shipwreck Prince Harry Meghan Markles honeymoon destination","story":"    Desolate: Shipwreck Lodge\u0027s design is based on the vessels washed up on the Namibian shoreAnd sources have told the Mail that £800-a-night Shipwreck Lodge, a new luxury hideaway in the remote spot, is being tipped as the couple’s venue of choice.

Instead, they’ll stay in the UK to attend Prince Charles’s 70th birthday celebrations on Tuesday. There are also plans for a trip to Dublin within weeks.          Luxury: Guest chalets at the lodge in Namibia feature breathtaking views of the oceanIndeed, their joint schedules are so busy over the coming months that some have predicted August is the earliest they will be able to escape. Last month, a local wrote on Facebook: ‘A little birdie told me that Prince Harry and Meghan are here for their honeymoon.’A spokesman for the lodge, Anica Britz, did not deny claims that Harry and Meghan might soon be jetting in, but said: ‘Unfortunately we cannot comment on or confirm the rumours that the royal couple will be staying at Shipwreck Lodge.’ Sources say Namibia – and the arresting landscape of the Skeleton Coast – is certainly top of Harry and Meghan’s list. Africa is a continent close to their hearts: both have done extensive charity and conservation work here and neighbouring Botswana was the location of one of their early dates, as well as a whirlwind holiday to mark Meghan’s 36th birthday last August. It will also appeal to their love of wildlife: Namibia is home to the world’s largest free-roaming black rhino population and Harry is a passionate animal-lover and anti-poaching campaigner.He has travelled to Namibia in the past. With ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, he canoed the Orange River in 2006 and missed Princess Charlotte’s christening in 2015 because he was working with rhino conservationists. Also said to be on the royal wish list is the enchanting opportunity to watch wildlife by moonlight at a waterhole in Ongava, a game reserve on the edge of the Etosha National Park. Visitors can watch leopards, rhinos, lions and zebras coming and going in near silence. Shipwreck Lodge, which is owned by the local government in conjunction with three upmarket travel agencies, has a number of activities on offer for any adventurous couple. Locals admit access is ‘tricky’ – making it perfect for this publicity-shy pair. Guests can charter a plane from the capital, Windhoek, or drive the five-and-a-half hours from Swakopmund to Mowe Bay themselves, after which the hotel provides guided 4x4s to cover the remaining two hours.          Insiders say builders are ‘frantically working to get it ready’ for the royal honeymoonersTheir nautically-themed accommodation features porthole windows and curved wooden beams.On the walls are vintage posters depicting the fates of vessels that have been wrecked, including the Dunedin Star – a cargo liner heading from Liverpool to Cape Town that ran aground in 1942.Day trips include excursions to the Mowe Bay seal colony, hyena-spotting at the Hoarusib River, sundowner cocktails in the spectacular dunes and treks to the homes of the nomadic Himba people.Rates rise to £1,450 in the August to mid-November peak season, although food and drink is included in the price, served by uniformed staff.

Judge Lorien Kite called it “witty, wise and constantly surprising” and “a delicate, historically nuanced portrait of Britain in the age of Brexit”. Cordelia Fine’s Testosterone Rex, an examination of the science behind gender bias that won the 2017 Royal Society science book prize, was also picked for the shortlist, alongside Christopher de Bellaigue’s The Islamic Enlightenment, a history of reformations in Islamic countries during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mark Mazower is also shortlisted for his memoir about his family’s roots in Russia, What You Did Not Tell, alongside Darren McGarvey’s Poverty Safari, an investigation into Britain’s most deprived communities and Clair Wills’s Lovers and Strangers, a history of immigrants in Britain.Kite, a journalist for the Financial Times, said the six titles “together illustrate the vigour and variety of political writing in our tumultuous times”.“Brexit, immigration, revolution, gender, poverty, the Middle East – the dominant themes were always clear, but so too was the range of approaches deployed by this year’s Orwell prize entries. History, fiction, memoir and science are all represented in our shortlist, six titles that succeed in quite different ways,” said Kite, who is joined on the judging panel by the politician and academic Andrew Adonis, the literary journalist Alex Clark and the novelist Kit de Waal.The winner will be announced on 25 June, Orwell’s 115th birthday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"im worth more than what i put on my face","story":"Cook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsCook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsIn my life, I’ve inhabited many different worlds. I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d296d2c2e4b7861b1b71142c0514c65b787e536/0_265_5007_3006/master/5007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a177647e97ed3fba38ce7508d70f1d","title":"chris grayling east coast mainline nationalisation","story":"Struggling to supply a lick of bright paint to his plans for the east coast mainline, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, settled on the word “iconic”. He told the Commons on Wednesday that the new, publicly owned operator scheduled to replace the failed Virgin-Stagecoach combine next month will be called the LNER. “One of Britain’s iconic rail brands … the London North Eastern Railway,” he said, getting it half right as usual: the original title had a conjunction – it was the London and North Eastern Railway – which gives a truer idea of its scope. Without the conjunction, it might be a suburban transport network that reaches no further than Enfield. With it, you have a notion of the 500-mile line that connects London King’s Cross to the great cathedrals of York and Durham, and skirts the North Sea all the way from Alnmouth to Aberdeen.Does pedantry always come with a liking for railways? Perhaps it does. (I often wonder at my own irritation. In the film Dunkirk, for example, the evacuees from the beaches come ashore in England to entrain in a carriage that obviously dates from the 1950s. Why oh why? ) But if railway enthusiasm can mean pedantry, and pedantry can mean truthfulness, then we might conclude that Grayling spent very little of his youth on the station platforms of Buckinghamshire, where he grew up. He was born in 1962, after all, which means that by the time he went to school in High Wycombe trainspotting was close to vanishing as a mainstream pastime for adolescent boys. He may have been aware that the railway that ran through his town was one of Britain’s last main lines, built jointly by the Great Western and Great Central to connect London more directly with the Midlands and the north he may also have known that, after the railway amalgamations of 1923, the LNER itself sent trains rushing through the Chiltern Hills. But a man who uses the phrase “iconic rail brands” does not seem likely to have been such a boy.I saw what I think of as my first LNER engine in December 1948. I know the year and the month because we were on our way from Lancashire to my grandparents’ golden wedding in Fife, and snow lay thick in the cuttings as our train climbed to the summits at Shap and Beattock. The railways had been nationalised in January that year, and, so far as I knew, as a child born into old London, Midland and Scottish territory, all engines were shabby and black. Then, at Carlisle, my brother pointed out a green engine – “apple-green” was the LNER’s description – that had probably travelled across England at the head of a train from Newcastle. I never saw one so unforgettably green again – it must have been one of the very last to have been painted in LNER colours – though a duller green was eventually adopted as the livery for the express classes on British Railways after an experimental year or two in a rich dark blue.When we moved north a few years later, to a house at the end of the Forth bridge, we found ourselves firmly in the LNER’s old domain. “Iconic” wasn’t then a word in regular use, but it would be true to say that the company had established a reputation for speed and modernity, which it owed to real achievement as well as a gifted publicity department. It was an LNER engine, the Mallard, that held the world speed record for steam traction (126mph near Grantham, 3 July 1938), and 15 years later locomotives of the same streamlined class regularly passed the bottom of our street, with names such as Empire of India, Commonwealth of Australia, Kingfisher and Merlin. Wedge-shaped fronts improved their aerodynamics and lifted smoke clear of the driver’s line of sight, while their distinctive chime whistles made us aware of their coming when still miles away. No other British steam engines took trains so frequently to speeds above 100mph, including the Flying Scotsman but then no other railway had a flatter or straighter mainline.Many children of my generation also witnessed the past in another way. From the late 1940s, writers such as John Betjeman, C Hamilton Ellis and OS Nock published essays and books that implied the golden age of British railways had died with the first world war. They would take a fragment of memory (like mine of the green engine at Carlisle) and from it construct what almost amounted to a worldview: Things Were Better Before. When this nostalgia was combined with an English distaste for state ownership, fostered by publications as disparate as Orwell’s 1984 and the , it left the nationalised railway with few friends and it was no wonder that when John Major talked of railway privatisation he summoned visions of the marvellous old Great Western and its coaches in their livery of chocolate and cream.The company that won the first franchise on the east coast mainline also reflected this affection – in its name, the Great North Eastern Railway, and also in the Victorian coat of arms that embellished the side of its trains, and the handsome blue-and-white crockery in its restaurant cars. None of this old-fashioned elegance, however, could alter the fact that it had overbid for its franchise – which also proved the case with its unloved successor, National Express, so that the service was taken into public ownership in 2009 and held there until the latest over-bidders, Virgin and Stagecoach, came along in 2015.Despite this unhappy record, Grayling is determined that the franchise will be delivered into private hands once again in 2020, this time as part of an experimental partnership with the owners of the track, the public institution Network Rail. The details are so far unspecified. All we know is that we have a brand, LNER, that floats disconnected from any historical reality. At least, unlike its immediate predecessors, it sounds neither like a soap powder nor a bourbon. For this small dignity we should be grateful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6dfca7dc97294668095c332db03ed678dd55f0/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86982d0ac7b1f0a4511def756dc001e","title":"harry meghan republican royal wedding","story":"The royal wedding, as we now know it, was born in 1922.

For the first time in a long time a royal wedding was held at Westminster Abbey, with a full procession and coverage by Pathé News. “It is now no longer Mary’s wedding,” wrote her brother, the future George VI. “But (this from the papers) it is the ‘Abbey Wedding’ or the ‘Royal Wedding’ or the ‘National Wedding’ or even the ‘People’s Wedding’.”Royal weddings are no more about two people being in love than a presidential inauguration is about a politician’s first day in a new job. That doesn’t mean the couple in question don’t necessarily love each other. Only that it is not a prerequisite for the ceremony.When it comes to royal events it is not iniduals but the institution – the monarchy – that really counts. So the nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are a private ceremony only in the formal sense that it is not an official state occasion. It will be televised, has received acres of newspaper coverage, has 600 guests, costs £32m, and 1,200 “commoners” have been nominated to “join in”.I wish it was private. Then they could have their seclusion and I could ignore it. But then what would the point of that be? “To be invisible,” wrote the 19th-century constitutionalist Walter Bagehot, “is to be forgotten … To be a symbol, and an effective symbol, you must be vividly and often seen.”I for one have already seen enough. I’m a republican for all the obvious reasons. A monarchy establishes inherited privilege at the heart of government and embeds patronage at the centre of power. The royals are a class act. And that’s the problem. I’m not a very passionate republican – many things bother me more than the monarchy. But as principles go it is unwavering. We have a class problem in Britain and the monarchy exemplifies it. If it’s a guilty pleasure I’m after, I don’t turn to betrothals in real-world feudal dynasties: I have Netflix. The political scientist Benedict Anderson described countries as imagined communities. Call me a misery guts, but I’d rather imagine one in which I am born a citizen, not a subject, and others are not born to govern me.I’d be fine leaving the whole thing alone the trouble is it won’t leave me alone. Last week Harry and Meghan showed up in both my kids’ book bags – they’d been invited by their schools to celebrate their wedding by wearing red, white and blue or buying cupcakes or both.This is propaganda through tasty pastry. The purpose of these highly scripted and tightly choreographed weddings is twofold: to renew the monarchy’s sense of legitimacy and to establish its relevance. Those who claim God has ordained that they should rule over everyone else will always have to worry about credibility. The Russian tsar executed by the Bolsheviks was the Queen’s grandfather’s cousin. Her husband, Prince Phillip, was evacuated from Greece as a baby on\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspwarship in a cot made from a fruit box. So she knows a thing or two about what can happen when legitimacy is lost.It is worth noting that the wedding in which the most royal PR capital has been invested – between Prince Charles and Lady Diana – was for the marriage that failed most publicly and calamitously. The uncertain response to Diana’s death was the one occasion in recent memory the institution looked vulnerable. For all that, the monarchy seems safe. Half of Britons think it is good for Britain and even more believe it should continue.Given the parlous state of our political class, the polarised nature of our political culture and the absurd figure we cut on the world stage following the Brexit vote, institutions such as the monarchy can be reassuring for some. A royal wedding provides a semblance of stability and the hope of unity for those who’d favour the certainties of a benign dictatorship over the vagaries of democracy.The royals’ relevance relates to their ability to adapt their elite entitlements to the popular mood. The Queen, for example, used clothing ration coupons to pay for her wedding dress (the government gave her £200 extra). Meanwhile both the Duchess of Cambridge and Markle have university degrees, the first royal brides who can claim such erudition. Being black, Markle is the first who can claim such melanin. These attributes, we’re told, illustrate the institution’s capacity to evolve. If anything they reveal the opposite. Women with university degrees and interracial marriages are neither recent nor rare in Britain. The fact they are remarkable at this level of the aristocracy is itself remarkable.But the weddings I enjoy are the ones where I know the people getting married. I have no more inclination to be interested in this wedding than to wander into a random church on a Saturday afternoon and become engrossed in the ceremony of anyone else I don’t know. I don’t begrudge anyone feeling differently. I understand that all sorts of people see all sorts of things in her, him, them and it. And I get the intrigue over Charles’s late entry as the candidate to walk Markle down the aisle. “A princely marriage is the brilliant edition of a universal fact, and, as such, it rivets mankind,” wrote Bagehot. “A royal family sweetens politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty events.”Once upon a time maybe. But at this stage the appeal for many seems to lie in a cross between Red Nose Day and the Eurovision song contest – a camp and kitschy licence to be lowbrow on a national scale. If they can derive pleasure from the elite marriage of strangers, that’s great. I bear no animus towards the happy couple on their big day.I am a republican and a humanist. Indeed, I am a republican because I am a humanist. I wish the iniduals well and the institution ill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a97d99d5e479c83c6835d20c3f4bb977126b76/0_0_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f47d5b5bee58113d28bf88138bebacb","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Sea otters, an African forest elephant and endangered Francois’ langurs are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65395bfd1bb5849346baf1c74b52c01d97033622/0_0_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f3876647acade4e0a5b99c784278c8e","title":"antonio conte chelsea winner lost mojo fa cup final","story":"Antonio Conte, clean‑shaven on the eve of the FA Cup final, digested the question, took a deep breath and then conjured a fresh analogy for an increasingly weary theme. “Last season was a wonderful season because we reached an important success,” the Chelsea head coach said, his mind retreating exactly 12 months to the raucous celebrations with the Premier League trophy on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. “But then you have to understand the way you won. If your car is going at 300km per hour, or if you are winning while going at normal velocity and aren’t risking burning out your engine.”The question, asked before the resumption of hostilities with José Mourinho and Manchester United, had been about whether defeat by Arsenal in last year’s Cup final had, in hindsight, provided glimpses of the unravelling which would follow. Whether Diego Costa’s post-match insistence that he would not be forced to China but would hold out for Atlético Madrid, or that glimpse of a team who had taken their eyes off the ball, were a portent of everything unsettling to come. It said much that Conte’s response, impressively inventive in his second language, was effectively a return to a default position.His sense of dissatisfaction at recruitment policy and perception that the board failed to build on last season’s success infected Chelsea through the second half of his tenure. The drip feed of negativity has lowered the collective mood. At times it is as if he has been goading Roman Abramovich, a notoriously trigger-happy owner. Quite possibly it was only the unpalatable prospect of a hefty compensation payout that stayed the owner’s hand, particularly after humiliations against Bournemouth and Watford. As it is he would have to fork out £9m to dispense with Conte’s services but there is a sense that the orce is imminent.Chelsea are used to chopping and changing. Theirs has been a boom-and-bust approach under Abramovich, and it has still yielded a trophy haul the envy of virtually every club in the country. Those on the inside accept they can be the victims of the kind of emotive, forthright manager they tend to appoint, though Carlo Ancelotti and others might argue it is a tolerance of relative failure that has been lacking.What the board has to contemplate is whether it would be to Chelsea’s benefit to dispense with an elite coach who has claimed major reward at every club he has overseen since 2010 – a promotion with Siena, three Serie A titles at Juventus and, after two years with Italy, last season’s Premier League – transforming a side who had finished 10th into title winners with only three key additions. Can a club condemned to the Europa League attract a candidate of similar status? Probably. Is there scope financially to lure a Luis Enrique or Leonardo Jardim, Maurizio Sarri or Massimiliano Allegri, plus their respective entourages, while also meting out compensation? Maybe, at a push. It might be worth the cost just to be rid of the whingeing.Conte’s constant sniping infuriated Juventus’ hierarchy eventually, for all the club’s dominance in Serie A, though the head coach had a point this time. Adding Álvaro Morata, Tiémoué Bakayoko, Danny Drinkwater, Antonio Rüdiger, Davide Zappacosta and Willy Caballero to ranks depleted by the departures of Nathan Aké, John Terry, Asmir Begovic, Nathaniel Chalobah, Nemanja Matic and Costa hardly constituted bolstering options before a title defence and Champions League campaign. An opportunity was passed up once Chelsea balked at Mino Raiola’s fee to restore Romelu Lukaku to Stamford Bridge, or Juve’s £80m asking price for Alex Sandro.There had been fears of a parting even in the immediate aftermath of the title win. Relations became so strained over the summer that Conte’s backroom staff, who had mainly been living in short-term lets, moved into a local hotel while they waited to discover if they would be retained. An uneasy truce was secured, with a new contract on improved, if not extended, terms papering over the cracks.Even the midwinter additions of Ross Barkley, Emerson and Olivier Giroud did not serve to appease. “I’m a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy players,” Conte said through a rueful smile in February. “I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good at persuading their clubs to spend money to buy top players.” That was an interesting message to send to the new arrivals, the recruitment department and the director Marina Granovskaia, who had assumed Michael Emenalo’s duties.Then there was the regular damning of Chelsea with praise for Manchester City, whose emergence under Pep Guardiola, secured until 2021, threatens to block any short-term route to recovery. “They are a club that want to invest and improve,” he said last month. “They did a great job on and off the pitch they were very well prepared for the season.”That unsettling sniping is unlikely to stop. If Granovskaia, with whom the Italian’s relationship is understood to have been particularly frosty at times, can secure someone more amenable to working within the relative financial constraints of Chelsea 2018 rather than Chelsea circa 2004 – Jardim perhaps – there would be fewer headaches all round. Thoughts drift back to the infamous text exchange between Conte and Costa. It was no secret the Italian hoped to be rid of the high-maintenance striker but those upstairs had not sanctioned him to communicate it so bluntly. It was as if he did not entirely trust the board to push through the sale, so forced the matter himself.The schism with Costa did not impress the players. Back in those celebratory scenes a year ago, there was a unity between staff and squad. The endless high-octane training had driven Chelsea, against the odds, to the title. This time round there is a sense of grumbling disquiet. The gruelling sessions left the team 30 points off City. In finishing 10th in 2016, Chelsea had been 31 points from the summit.Many were baffled by the six changes made against Huddersfield this month just as a semblance of momentum was building in the pursuit of the top four. David Luiz has hardly featured since questioning the management after a humiliation at Roma. Eden Hazard has not enjoyed his guest appearances as a false No 9. Willian, who has started once since a stroppy substitution in the Cup semi-final, was asked about his relationship with Conte by ESPN Brazil this week. “Oh boy, do you really want me to tell you?” he replied. “Well, let’s save it for our next interview.” Chelsea will be far more reluctant to lose Hazard or Willian than Conte."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8d8898129f62b5a9a650a25ea935655bb9a0e0/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c6ab48649e0608d24bd1e5e2004da2","title":"google facebook security data duckduckgo","story":"Over the past month I’ve tried my best not to use Google. I deleted my Facebook account. I’ve gone through all my phone and iPad apps, closing down the “permissions” that give them access to my calendar, camera, contacts and location. And I’ve switched to DuckDuckGo as my (home) web browser. Like millions of others I was astounded not just by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, but the industrial-scale data harvesting by Google revealed in that extraordinary article by Dylan Curran in the .After reading it, I picked a random day in 2014 to find out what Google had on me – and was astonished at the intensity of location tracking and snooping on all my movements.But my trial separation has been tough. I’ve (almost) completely finished with Facebook. But living without Google has been far harder.My partner calls me “iPaddy” for the amount of time I spend on the bloody thing – mostly reading and checking news sites. But a good thing about the iPad is that in “settings” it’s simple to switch out of Google and into DuckDuckGo as your default browser.DuckDuckGo, if you don’t know, is the search engine that promises not to intrude. “It’s sort of creepy that people at search engines can see all this info about you,” it says. Unlike Google, it doesn’t attempt to track you. It doesn’t store IP addresses or personalise your search results according to what past data it has built up on you.But does it work? There is nothing I’ve not been able to find while using it although, as I haven’t put every search request into Google and DuckDuckGo at the same time, it’s not an entirely scientific comparison. Results are displayed and ranked in a similar fashion to Google. There are ads, but you can go into settings and turn them off.The biggest drawback was mapping – DuckDuckGo puts you through to Apple’s service – although images aren’t great, either. Until you are off Google, you don’t realise what a beautiful thing its mapping features are. And my determination not to give away my location means I’m now assailed by pop-up boxes once I click on a site. Last Sunday I searched for films at my local Omniplex cinema. Google would probably know where I was, and send me to the page with listings appropriate to my local area. Now I have to click into the general cinema site, click past the location pop-up request, then manually select which cinema is my local. But these are small gripes and I’m very happy to continue with DuckDuckGo on my iPad.Changing ad settings has been enlightening. We’re warned that if we turn off personalised ads, we get a weirdly untailored experience. You\u0026nbspdo – but so what?Cutting free from Google on a smartphone is another matter. If, like me, you have a company paid-for Android-based phone linked to Gmail, you can hardly hide from Google. But I’m not prevented from turning off location services, and since my phone is the main way it tracks me, it\u0027s a small triumph.I was never a Facebook fan, so deleting it was entirely painless. But it doesn’t let you go without a fight. It said it would hold the door open for me to return, and not delete all my data, should I come back within a short while. It worked. A week later I came back on, as I needed to contact a Facebook group for work. But that has been the sum total of my Facebook life since. But then there’s WhatsApp, which has become the key way our wider family connects. It is, of course, owned by Facebook. Some companies you can’t escape from."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e834ddfcf276c5a88110c761b6e1afa60efbb2/19_136_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37055a92981ef1850d3358a9594a561d","title":"rare whisky vintage scotch auction","story":"Vintage Scotch dubbed ‘holy grail of Macallan’ auctioned in Hong KongA bottle of single malt whisky has been sold for a record $1.1m (£815,760) at an auction in Hong Kong.The very rare 1926 Macallan scotch whisky was sold an hour after a bottle of the same vintage also changed hands for a slightly smaller seven-figure sum. The whisky bottles, which had not been seen in public since they were last auctioned three decades ago, are described as the “holy grail of Macallan” because only 24 bottles were produced as gifts for the distillery’s most-valued customers. The bottles feature specially commissioned labels by the pop artists Valerio Adami, which sold for $1.1m (£814,000), and Sir Peter Blake, which sold for just over $1m. The Blake-designed bottle sold to a telephone bidder and the Adami-designed bottle was sold to a bidder in the room at Bonhams auction house in Hong Kong. The record sale price works out at £1,080 per millilitre of whisky. Both bidders were undisclosed.The previous whisky sale price record was set in 2017 with the £730,000 sale of a six-bottle lot of Macallan. The previous record for a single bottle was the £466,000 paid for a Macallan M Imperiale in 2014, although an Imperiale contains eight and a half 70cl bottles worth of whisky. Daniel Lam, Bonhams’ head of fine wine and whisky in Hong Kong, said: “These two bottles are the most significant whiskies ever produced in 20th century and truly presented a once-in-a-generation opportunity for collectors to acquire the holy grail of Macallan.“Active bidding came in from around the world but we saw new bidders from South-east Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, reflecting the growing appetite and appreciation for whisky among Asian collectors.”The whisky, which was bottled in 1986, is presented in specially commissioned cabinets or Tantaluses, based on the traditional ‘brass and glass’ distillery spirit safe. Blake is best known for co-creating the Beatles’ album cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club band in 1967, which was voted by Rolling Stone magazine as the No 1 album of all time. Adami is an Italian artist famous for painting bold, flat forms outlined in thick, black lines, in a style reminiscent of comic art.

And they often bear documents, photographs, audio recordings or videos.This surveillance apparatus has remade the rules of celebrity. Drip-drip revelations about Lindsay Lohan’s trial for theft in 2011 prompted one judge to compare TMZ to the CIA.The site is respected, imitated, feared and loathed – but never ignored.“Harvey has amazing contacts and they just keep plugging away,” said David Thompson, a former LA-based editor for OK! magazine who now runs a public relations firm, Cavalry PR. “They have the manpower. They’re not just about repeating gossip because they don’t stop until they get to the source of the story.”Fobbing off TMZ tends to not work, said Thompson. “With someone like TMZ you’re usually not helping the client if you’re a publicist and all you do is say no comment. It’s going to turn out better in the long run if you’re able to work with them.”That wasn’t an option for Buckingham Palace after it left Markle’s father, a retired lighting director, unprepared and ill-equipped to handle the paparazzi who staked out his home in Mexico.The 73-year-old cracked under the strain, collaborated in clumsily staged photos and suffered heart problems and emotional agony, putting in doubt whether he would walk his daughter down the aisle.TMZ swept in and got a scoop on each twist, turning TMZ into the Thomas Markle zigzag chronicles – essential reading for royal watchers and the palace’s hapless wedding planners.“We didn’t pay him anything, he didn’t ask for anything,” Levin said in one of the site’s daily syndicated TV shows. A reporter contacted Prince Harry’s future father-in-law and won his trust, simple as that, said Levin.TMZ’s founder is more circumspect with reporters. Contacted for this article, Levin referred the  to a publicist who said no company representative was available for interview.Much of TMZ’s success has a simple explanation: boots on the ground. In an era of shrivelling newsrooms it stations teams in courthouses to scan dockets and deploys others across LA, chasing tips and rumours for celebrity news big and small.“TMZ are out there on the street with video cameras pouncing on BCD-list celebs,” said one former reporter for Mail Online’s LA office. Other outlets, in contrast, “mainly just write around sets of pics that come in from freelance photographers”.TMZ cultivates multiple sources – defence lawyers, prosecutors, court clerks, bellhops, chauffeurs, chambermaids, barmen, police, paramedics – and lubricates, when necessary, with cash. Levin, 67, founded the site in 2005 with a resolve to smash, as he saw it, a corrupt cocoon of fixers and enablers who hushed up celebrity crimes, follies and misdemeanors.Scoops flowed: Mel Gibson’s antisemitic rant, Michael Richards’s racist diatribe, Michael Jackson’s death (reported 18 minutes after he stopped breathing), Chris Brown beating up Rihanna, Prince’s death, Solange Knowles assaulting Jay-Z. A 24-hour ticker-tape of revelations that stoked anxiety in Hollywood. Rumours spread of a TMZ vault with salacious material withheld from publication as long as celebrities gave up other secrets.One bodyguard, speaking on condition of anonymity, assumed – not necessarily correctly – that TMZ was the main client for the paparazzi who stalk his client, a singer. “Whenever she’s ready to leave, they’re there.”Some celebrities and publicists have adapted by discreetly collaborating with TMZ, which sometimes sheathes the sword for fawning stories and flattering photos.Others wage a cold war and denounce Levin as Frankenstein, or worse. “He is a festering boil on the anus of American media,” Alec Baldwin told the New Yorker. Prince Harry may have had choice words in 2012 after TMZ published pictures of him partying naked in Las Vegas. Levin, a fitness fanatic who works out before dawn, takes special pride in consequential scoops, such as a video of US marines urinating on dead insurgents in Afghanistan or a bailed-out bank blowing millions on a party.

Most seem to expect a holiday abroad a couple of times a year, new clothes and meals out – whereas we go for a few drinks in the pub at the weekend and eat out less than once a month.There have only been a couple of times in my life when I’ve not had to worry about money and, unusually, one of those periods was when I was a student. I juggled jobs as a childminder, shop assistant and nightclub attendant and could earn £150 a day, going into bars asking people about cigarettes and alcohol for a market research company.My bank balance dipped when I left university, married and bought a house. I dreamt of a career in journalism and took on freelancing jobs for a local paper. When in 2012 my husband and I decided to move back to London, we swapped our three-bedroom terraced house in Frome – which sold for £205,000 – for a wreck of a flat in Clapton, east London, and money was tight.My freelancing wasn’t earning enough for anything other than bare essentials and after a year of spartan living I realised my chosen life wasn’t working out. I put my journalism ambitions to one side and took a full-time contract job copywriting for a tech startup. At its peak it earned me £250 a day. Suddenly I didn’t have to worry about money any more. I didn’t get paid leave so in my two years with the company, I rarely took a day off.That flush period was short-lived. When I gave birth to our three-year-old I lost the job. I was told my post would be kept open for me but they wouldn’t put it in writing – and it wasn’t. The statutory maternity pay of £137 a week and the £10,000 I’d saved kept me going for 10 months, and when it ran out I took a part-time job on a magazine, though that only paid £75 a day. Luckily, my parents were very generous when it came to childcare.When my daughter was one I set up a digital parenting magazine, theearlyhour, for new parents, like me, who felt lonely in the early hours of the morning. I learned how to monetise it, and it now earns me between £500 and £2,000 a month. Setting up the business has led to consultancy work – I do it once or twice a month, and charge £500 a day. There have also been brand collaborations and photoshoots, which can pay up to £1,000 a job. I earn £200 a month blogging for BabyCentre and £600 copywriting for women’s app Clementine. Recently I was given a £5,000 advance by 4th Estate to write The Freelance Mum, a guide for other mothers looking to fit freelance work around family.I now have two young children and choose to work around them rather than forking out for full-time childcare. My daughter is at pre-school from Monday to Friday, and my one-year-old son has a childminder two half-days a week, which costs £400.Although my income has improved and we split the bills, we still have to live fairly frugally because I don’t have a predictable salary. I need to earn about £1,200 net to pay my bills and on months when I exceed this I put the extra into a holiday fund or a savings account to cover the lean times.We’ve cut out meat from our diet to save money. I reckon that’s reduced our food bills by a third. We cook from scratch to make food go further and typically spend about £600 a month in supermarkets.We allocate about £200 a month for family spending at the weekend. My husband pays the mortgage, utility bills, weekend days out and for the car. I cover childcare, food during the week, clothes for the children and me which averages at £100 a month, my £45 a month phone bill and subscriptions to Netflix and Spotify.As told to Anna Tims"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a41f632fef42d63a5425fb982283f7115d3cd8a2/0_0_3600_2396/master/3600.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=517a5633a005f370c49c09756e09dc07 2600w","title":"may names nine new tory peers to boost party after brexit defeats","story":"Timing of announcement prompts claims that No 10 is using royal wedding to hide itTheresa May has on the eve of the royal wedding nominated nine new Tory peers, including the former cabinet ministers Sir Eric Pickles and Peter Lilley and handed one to Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party as she tries to bolster her party’s fragile position in the House of Lords.Four other former Tory MPs are to be elevated to a chamber which has defied May’s government on 15 occasions over Brexit, in an afternoon announcement that has prompted accusations that No 10 was trying to use Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding to bury the news.The full list of Tories includes Sir Edward Garnier, Sir John Randall, Sir Alan Haselhurst and Andrew Tyrie, all former MPs. May’s other nominees are Diana Barran, Catherine Meyer, the founder of Action Against Abduction who is married to former US ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer, and Amanda Sater, a former party deputy chair.The nominations will tilt the balance of the chamber slightly in favour of May, taking her party’s total of peers from 244 to 253. But no party has a majority in the 780-strong upper house, and the government has been so heavily defeated on some amendments that introducing a handful of more supportive peers will only make a modest difference in getting Brexit through parliament.The DUP will nominate the former MP William McCrea, who has been criticised for sharing a platform in the past with Billy Wright, a loyalist paramilitary. Only McCrea’s name emerged, despite rumours that the DUP was initially offered at least one other nomination.Labour was granted three nominations, and Jeremy Corbyn put forward the former party general secretary Iain McNicol and the race equality campaigner Martha Osamor, the mother of the MP Kate Osamor, as had been expected. The third nominee is Pauline Bryan, a Scottish campaigner and editor of What Would Keir Hardie Say?, a collection of essays once given by Corbyn to Barack Obama.The proposed elevation of Osamor was immediately criticised by a Jewish campaign group after it emerged that she was one of several signatories to a 2016 letter complaining about the suspension of Ken Livingstone and others over antisemitism. Arguing that the suspensions were McCarthyite, the letter said the charges of antisemitism were being used to “silence criticisms of Israel … and undermine Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn”.Gideon Falter, the chair of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said that elevating Osamor was a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, and that Corbyn’s decision was “telling us not only that he sees her behaviour as unproblematic, but that he sees it as being worthy of the highest honour and a lifelong seat in the House of Lords”.Political peers are nominated periodically at the initiation of Downing Street in a behind-the-scenes haggling process, which in this case began in November, and starts with a debate about how many each party is granted. Names are suggested informally and canvassed before the House of Lords appointments commission to see if they meet the appropriate financial and legal standards before finally being formally submitted.The Liberal Democrats did not make any nominations, although it is well represented in the chamber with 98 peers. Dick Newby, the party’s leader in the Lords, said: “This is a cynical response from Theresa May to losing a string of votes in the Lords in recent weeks.”Lilley, a Thatcherite who has long been a Eurosceptic, was Margaret Thatcher’s trade secretary and then social security secretary in John Major’s government. At the 1992 party conference he sang about his “little list” of benefit fraudsters and was an energetic promoter of the idea that many people on social security were scroungers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0983f3f3bdfd0334154d8c41fc1f2333f9da823/0_0_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=822aaf2b14e96304582572ace29afe4a","title":"theresa may john bercow andrea leadsom alleged stupid woman remarks unacceptable","story":"Theresa May’s spokesman says ‘unacceptable’ comment must be looked at if complaint madeTheresa May has said there should be an investigation if a complaint is made over allegations that John Bercow, the House of Commons Speaker, called Andrea Leadsom a “stupid woman” in heated exchanges after prime minister’s questions.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “We’ve seen the alleged remarks and clearly the prime minister thinks they are unacceptable. And if an official complaint is made, it should be properly investigated.”But MPs have said the Commons system of investigation is too flawed to do an effective job. Although any complaint can trigger an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, her report has to be submitted to the committee on standards.On Tuesday, MPs on the committee blocked an inquiry into historical allegations of bullying by Bercow by three votes to two. The committee is unique because it has lay members, but they do not have a vote. It is understood these members unanimously supported an investigation. Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has been spearheading work to improve the system for reporting and investigating complaints. She is said to believe the committee’s decision underlines the need to revoke MPs’ power to decide on sanctions.In the Commons on Wednesday, Bercow was overheard swearing under his breath after he criticised Leadsom for arranging government statements that took up time intended for a Labour debate on Grenfell. An opposition MP told Leadsom what they had heard. She is understood not to want to raise a complaint personally and so far no one has lodged a complaint with the standards commissioner. If a complaint were lodged, it is thought this could allow Stone to investigate the historical allegations of bullying, despite the committee’s move to block it.The Speaker’s office did not deny that Bercow made the remark. “Strong and differing views” had been expressed in the chamber on an “unusual and controversial day”, it said, adding: “The Speaker treats his colleagues with respect and strives at every turn to facilitate the House of Commons.”The historical allegations of bullying were made earlier this year in a BBC Newsnight investigation. They involved two senior members of Commons staff, who had each been Bercow’s private secretary after he was elected Speaker.Kate Emms allegedly developed post-traumatic stress disorder after working for him, and Angus Sinclair took compulsory early retirement. He said Bercow had demeaned and physically intimidated him, once smashing a mobile phone on his desk. Later, another former senior parliamentary figure, David Leakey, criticised Bercow. Bercow has emphatically denied allegations that he bullied Sinclair and Emms.The allegations emerged after Leadsom had finished her inquiry into overhauling the complaints system in the Commons. She has made no secret of the fact that she wanted the committee set up to investigate complaints to be given the power to examine recent allegations about past incidents.Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP who was on the committee and is part of the steering group overseeing reform, said: “If there isn’t urgent reform to the standards committee there will be a massive outcry.“For as long as MPs are both judge and jury we are never going to have a fair and independent complaints system – it urgently needs to change so there is a proper way to deal with allegations of this nature. otherwise we are letting down Commons staff and ending up with trial by media which risks wronging everyone.” Bercow, a former Conservative MP, has had an increasingly stormy relationship with MPs and ministers, mainly those on the Tory side of the house, since he was elected in 2009.James Duddridge, one of his most outspoken critics, challenged Labour MPs over their support for Bercow. “Labour can’t pretend to be a decent party that cares about issues of sexism and bullying and procedure while supporting him, even if he is a pain for the government and helpful to them,” he said. “There’s a bigger picture here. He’s normalising bullying.”Bercow’s detractors feel he is immune to criticism because of the unique authority of his office. The Speaker is the champion of backbenchers, and of the principle of government accountability to the Commons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f4aa3f8292242490615cd099ff523aec3047041/0_251_3672_2203/master/3672.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71fdfb40fbe4bffe41457eb8fe531617","title":"maro itoje saracens wasps premiership semi final","story":"Saracens have won the second halves of their past four matches by a 149-0 aggregate. Their average scoreline in the same four games is 54-11. It seems the fug that disrupted the middle of their season – some might call it international rugby – has well and truly passed.If NovemberDecember was a good time to play them and FebruaryMarch not bad, the Saracens machine is purring again just when it matters, the long, brutal English season reduced now to the only two weekends that really count. Wasps, not afraid of a play-off themselves, travel to north London on Saturday for quite the Premiership semi-final assignment.“We’re in a very good place,” the blindside flanker Maro Itoje said. “We have a strong team that unfortunately had a couple of injuries, but some big players are coming back for us, so all in all we’re moving in the right direction at the right time.”The biggest of the players is Billy Vunipola, who makes his latest comeback after an injury-disrupted 18 months, lining up opposite another England No\u0026nbsp8 returning from injury, Nathan Hughes. Saracens are not without absentees even now, but the sense of a force gathering at the right time is difficult to deny, an echo of the Leicester and Wasps teams that dominated English rugby for so long, mastering the play-off system.There are parallels between Saracens’ season and England’s, although Eddie Jones’s team might be said to find themselves where Saracens were at the turn of the year, reeling from an unfamiliar combination of consecutive defeats. Itoje and Owen Farrell, the new England captain, are among those players who have turned Saracens round, which has encouraging implications for England’s tour to South Africa next month, the more so if Saracens’ form continues over the next couple of weekends.Itoje himself was the subject of scrutiny during the Six Nations, questions asked of his state of mind and body, the jewel of English rugby seemingly tarnished by the demands of the modern game. His response has been decisive.“You know what, talk of tiredness doesn’t really bother me. I know how I was feeling. I know my body. Since then we’ve had some good weeks at work and some down weeks, and I’m feeling good.”Some of the down weeks are attributable to those tribulations midwinter. Saracens scraped through to the quarter-finals of Europe, and a trip to Leinster a fortnight after the Six Nations proved an assignment too much even for their returning form. That was five games ago. Interspersed between the subsequent romps against Premiership opposition have been two rare weekends off, leaving the team simmering in a way that was impossible when they last played in a Premiership play-off, a year ago at Exeter, the weekend after they had won the Champions Cup.To ask anyone in the Saracens camp this week about the difference between now and then was to be met with a look of disdain, as if they were being invited to explain away their absence from last season’s Premiership final by as human a failing as fatigue. Saracens have long ago dispatched any suggestion they can play only one way, but what underpins the cavalcade of points (they have scored more this season than anyone since the 26-round Premiership of 1999, and their points differential is the best by anyone) is\u0026nbspruthlessness.For the neutral, Wasps are the perfect opponents. If any team have a chance of teasing out the fluffier side of Saracens, it is them, their commitment to the brilliant as unswerving as it is life-affirming and effective.At the heart of it, Danny Cipriani has finally earned the England call‑up for which so many have clamoured. He and Farrell represent perhaps the pick of some delicious head-to-head battles this weekend. They may feature side by side for England in South Africa. Cipriani enthused about the prospect this week. Farrell’s reaction when asked if he was looking forward to it was to narrow his eyes and say: “Not\u0026nbspyet.”The flamboyant and the ruthless. England hope they might dovetail in June. This weekend they face off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18bf979bf88d366c324d691a018b9461582e2f23/0_12_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3f846d026cd06f73d705c75181ec643","title":"jos buttler england recall","story":"It might seem odd that English sport’s great invisible superstar is back in the Test team on the back of his Indian Premier League status but his selection is bold and sensibleEvery year in the US five people die and 10\u0026nbspmillion dollars of damage is caused as a result of deep-frying a turkey. This appears to be a festive tradition among bearded flag-draped men with hunting knives and baggy shorts, men for whom freedom’s just another word for caramelising your own arteries and shouting a lot on YouTube.But freedom comes at a cost. Each deep-fried turkey takes seven gallons of superheated fat. A special chain is required to lower it into its hell-cauldron. Moisture is the\u0026nbspkey issue: a pocket of concealed water inside the turkey can cause it to explode into a roiling spume of flames and fat.All things considered it would probably be more sensible to cook these turkeys in the oven, to play it straight. But then, you don’t get a special chain. You don’t get seven gallons of oil, or great melting mouthfuls\u0026nbspof face-scalding fat-soaked bird, so tangy and\u0026nbspmoist and crispy-skinned you’re already salivating over it now.Bad ideas that look delicious. Delicious ideas that are – despite being delicious – also clearly very bad. Ideas that end up with everyone catching salmonella, the house on fire and England 86 for eight on a nibbly green seamer. There was a note of this in the first sight of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan next week with specific reference to the gripping, oddly decadent selection of Jos Buttler as a specialist No\u0026nbsp7 batsman, given licence to wander out, sniff the air and basically make the game up in front of him.There is a degree of natural resistance to this, a sense that to pick Buttler is to devalue decisively the proving\u0026nbspgrounds of county cricket. Buttler averages 17\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspfour red‑ball games over the past year. His selection\u0026nbspis at odds with all we have heard about the informed methods of Ed\u0026nbspSmith, out there crunching his data curves, occasionally emitting a clank of excitement over some outstanding first-innings metrics from the strangely overlooked Cakebread-Thomas of Derbyshire\u0026nbspseconds.Instead we have this. Faced with an ailing team and a general anxiety about how to make all forms of cricket more instantly comestible the selectors have reached for the most more-ish option have decided, basically, to just give up and deep-fry the turkey.And yet it is undeniably the right thing to do. Not playing Buttler when you have the chance to play Buttler: that really would be weird. “He hasn’t been picked because of the IPL,” Smith said this week. But he clearly has. Buttler has been picked, in part, because he is famous, because right now he is among the top three hottest, most luminously attractive cricketers in the current edition of the sixth biggest sporting league in the world.This is simply the truth and everyone involved should embrace it, because it’s both entirely sensible and entirely consistent with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s more gimmicky attempts to popularise the game. If we’re willing to junk\u0026nbspthe basic robustness of the sport via the Hundred, to introduce the new colts cricket rules trailed\u0026nbspthis week – ditch the lbw law, double-run maxi zones in the field – then it looks like old-school good sense to pick the most pop-famous cricketer in the country as often as possible.The fact is Buttler stands outside the normal rules and numbers. This has been said before about other cricketers. But in this case it’s actually true. He was a ludicrous spectacle in the IPL this year, driving and cuffing and gliding his way to 389 runs off 258 balls at an average of 97, with that familiar, beautifully delicate kind of violence in those whip-crack wrists.It is traditional at this point to suggest batting on pitches where the ball moves, where a flighty fifty can lose a game rather than win it, is a different matter altogether. Plus Buttler has been batting with a self‑made technique in India, adopting that white‑ball power hitting stance, front leg shifted to one side so he can hit in front of square from the same base, sending the ball through the field in a weird flat, scything arc.The thing is, it works. Just as moving up to open has worked, despite the need to adapt instantly to new angles, speeds, pressures. English\u0026nbspcricket has no history of producing unorthodox players, certainly not at this global-genius level. But for once it is perhaps simply time to go with it.The real issue around Buttler’s career isn’t his ability to defend against the swinging ball. The absurdity of mature Buttler is that he is essentially a blank in his own country, a Category\u0026nbspA sports person in a global game who could probably walk in and buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognition.This week the chairman of the ECB told us children just don’t like cricket. This is of course dangerous nonsense. The game is good. The talent is there. But it is also invisible to swathes of the population, just as Buttler has become English sport’s great invisible superstar, hidden away behind the high hedge on the last\u0026nbspremaining patch of green.For an industry that spends a lot of time quivering and whining about what it doesn’t have, Buttler is the asset, the talent. Centre stage may be a little left of centre these days. But it’s time to get him out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7e479c340117e27c6bbc7ab017c44ec31d419f0/39_82_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bce23ede95766d01852d2a48d2afc2dd","title":"talking horses addeybb can land lockinge stakes newbury horse racing tips","story":"Any Aidan O’Brien runner in any race deserves the highest respect and his Rhododendron is a veteran of nine Group One contests, making her a formidable opponent for anyone.

The deal calls for changes to fiscal policy and a €780 (£680) monthly basic income for poor families.It also spells out a new crackdown on immigration, including a “serious and efficient” programme to drive out migrants who arrive in Italy illegally. The plan calls for more detention centres to be opened in every region, in which migrants could be held for up to 18 months.The agreement calls for an overhaul of the Dublin treaty, so that asylum seekers would be distributed across the EU instead of being required to stay in the country where they first arrive, and it calls for religious leaders to be registered with the state. All camps of “unregistered” Roma would be shut down under the plan.Italy’s general election on 4 March resulted in a hung parliament. Matteo Salvini, the head of the League, and the Five Star Movement’s Luigi di Maio have been locked in negotiations for weeks to agree on a common set of governing goals. The pair have still not agreed on who should serve as prime minister. The new government’s platform is expected to be approved by M5S members late on Friday in an online poll. On Monday, Di Maio and Salvini are expected to meet Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, to formalise the launch of the government. Once a prime minister has been nominated and ministers sworn in, the government will face a vote of confidence in the parliament. Both parties ran campaigns that vilified migrants, and Salvini has attacked Italy’s Roma population throughout his political career. It is not clear whether Italy has the legal right or resources to follow through on some of the radical ideas that were agreed, but the League vowed during the electoral campaign to institute mass deportations of asylum seekers to Africa as part of a reshaping of migration policies.Immigration experts said the new agreement meant programmes seeking to integrate new migrants could be closed. “They campaign against any positive actions or programmes, which are the very basis for any minority. This keeps them in a structurally backward position,” said Francesco Palermo, a former senator who was a vocal proponent of Romany rights in Italy. “It is more populist than racist, they feel this is what the voters want, and unfortunately average Italian society is against Roma, against migrants, against sexual minorities.”Kyenge, who now serves as an MEP, has worked for years to try to change Italy’s citizenship laws so that children of migrants can be recognised as Italians. Last year the government failed to pass a law that would have eased the path to citizenship for 800,000 minors who were born in Italy or came as young children. Kyenge said these children were unable to fully participate in schools and in society. “The identity of a person begins when you are little and it is then you must have an opportunity to say ‘I am an Italian’.”The Congolese-born doctor has lived in Italy since 1983, and has been on the receiving end of deeply offensive racist slurs. Roberto Calderoli, a senator and former minister under Silvio Berlusconi, likened her to an orangutan and told her she should be a minister “in her country”. Mario Borghezio, a far-right MEP, said Kyenge would impose a “bongo-bongo” administration on Italy – comments that led to him being expelled from a Ukip-led group in the European parliament. In 2017 a judge ordered him to pay €50,000 to Kyenge for his racist remarks.Kyenge still has bodyguards to protect her when she is in her home country, as a result of racist abuse from politicians. “People want to attack me because of the colour of my skin and many of those are politicians and it is very sad because politicians should give an example,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3269547a7c15387881c41f5ddc23fd209ec68957/69_0_2063_1238/master/2063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e3c59c0618af81f9e784f5627a3137","title":"china says air force lands bombers on south china sea islands","story":"Exercise described by air force as preparation for ‘the battle’ for the disputed waters China’s air force has landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region, it said in a statement.Several bombers of various types – including the long-range, nuclear strike-capable H-6K – carried out landing and take off drills at an unidentified island airfield after carrying out simulated strike training on targets at sea, the Chinese airforce said.“A ision of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) recently organised multiple bombers such as the H-6K to conduct take-off and landing training on islands and reefs in the South China Sea in order to improve our ability to ‘reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions’,” it said.The statement said the pilot of the H-6K bomber conducted assault training on a designated sea target and then carried out take-offs and landings at an airport in the area, describing the exercise as preparation for “the west Pacific and the battle for the South China Sea”. The notice, published on the PLAAF’s Weibo microblogging account, did not provide the precise location of the exercise. The US has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is also subject to claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia. The waters are vital global shipping routes and contain what are believed to be significant oil and natural gas deposits.“The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Christopher Logan said. “We have seen these same reports and China’s continued militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilise the region.” Wang Mingliang, a defence expert cited in the Chinese statement, said the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force “strengthen its combat capability to deal with maritime security threats”.The move comes weeks after US network CNBC reported that China had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defences on outposts in the Spratly Islands that are also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines, citing sources close to US intelligence.Washington warned Beijing would face unspecified “consequences” over its militarisation of the South China Sea, and said it had raised the issue with China.In an analysis published on its website, CSIS said the location of the runway was believed to be Woody Island, China’s largest base in the Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.China has engaged in years of land-reclamation efforts on reefs it controls in the region and built both civilian and military facilities in the contested area.Chinese military facilities include air bases, radar and communications systems, naval facilities and defensive weaponry including landing strips able to accommodate military planes.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496108.1526392982!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new furry prey for the windhover by any other name","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFor raptors like kestrel (above) and barn owl, the influx of voles and greater white-toothed shrew  offers a change of diet. Illustration: Michael VineyWhere the hill behind us curves round to face west, there’s a stretch where it steepens sharply and is littered with glacial rocks. Any breeze from the sea – which is usual – bounces up the slope to let a kestrel hover there with spread wings and least effort: perhaps it has a wind-map in its mind of these things.“Windhover” is an old name for Falco tinnunculus (falco being the Latin for sickle, the shape of the wings, and tinnunculus for jingling, as of a bell and onomatopoeic for the kestrel’s rare cry). It is also a name I love, surviving the ecstatic densities of Gerard Manley Hopkins’s much-parsed poem. Pursuing the word’s history online brought me to a lively row over two supposedly ancient alternatives in historic English usage: “windfucker” and “windsucker”. The first is advanced in an online dictionary compiled by an American sociologist and author Douglas Harper (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001-2018). A criticism that the elongated “s” of old manuscripts has simply been misread has prompted vigorous and erudite exchanges (see Wiktionary: Talk: windfucker).The current balance of the argument seems to be that both words have sound provenance, with the “f” word in use as synonym for “beat” or “strike” – something vigorous, anyway – in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the other as having local usage from Kent to Orkney. Of much more interest scientifically has been a Finnish study in the 1990s, which showed the hovering kestrel’s ability to track voles on the ground below through ultraviolet (UV) reflections from the urine and faeces the rodents use to scent-mark their runways.In northern Europe, and notably in Scandinavia, there are broadly four-year cycles of change that synchronise crashes in the vole population with kestrel migrations over hundreds of square kilometres. When this happens, how do the birds seek out the most promising concentrations of voles?The Finnish researchers used captive kestrels in laboratory experiments to show that they detected vole scent marks in UV light but not in visible light. Then they moved out into field trials over some 100sq km of level farmland.They ided this into areas with and without artificial vole trails of urine and faeces, and without trails at all, and distributed kestrel nesting boxes between them, 15 to each. They watched the foraging, mostly male birds for 24 mornings as they hunted near the boxes the following spring and charted their special attention to the areas with artificial scent trails.Ireland had no voles until the bank vole, Myodes variolus, arrived in the 1920s with German earth-moving machinery brought in through Foynes to build the Shannon dam at Ardnacrusha. They now extend through nearly half the island, mostly in the south and west.Another alien invader, the greater white-toothed shrew, was discovered in 2008, its little bones showing up in disgorged pellets of kestrels and barn owls in Tipperary and Limerick. The shrew is thought to have arrived en famille in the root ball of a big plant imported to an Irish garden centre now, advancing at some 5km a year, it is colonising seven counties.Ireland has been poor in small mammal species, but the two newcomers have threatened those we have, and notably the native field mouse and pygmy shrew. The latter is disappearing altogether where both aliens are present.Such changes have brought what has been called “an invasional meltdown” to the ecosystems of hedgerow and grassland. And for raptors like kestrel and barn owl, it offers a change of diet.Dr Pat Smiddy, an ornithologist and conservation ranger, decided to take some measure of change by analysing kestrel pellets across 650sq km of east Co Cork and west Co Waterford – farmland within the aliens’ known territory. From nest sites in old and ruined buildings, many of which he knew, he collected 1,057 of the pellets.Teased apart for significant bones, every site yielded bits of bank voles, especially where the greater white-toothed shrew was also present. The pygmy shrew turned up mostly where the bigger shrew was absent and never where both aliens live together. Field and house mice and brown rat – traditional kestrel prey – were low in the percentage of remains.This research into Irish kestrel diet, the most comprehensive so far, shows how important the alien mammals have become for birds of prey and the impact of their competition with native furry species. Our birds of prey are changing too, as red kite, golden and white-tailed eagles have been introduced as apex predators, so that a whole new wildlife scenario heads into the problems of climate change.Dr Smiddy’s study is published in the Biology and Environment journal of the Royal Irish Academy.

Photograph: Dado RuvicReuters  Nearly 900 paid-for advertisements relating to the referendum on the Eighth Amendment, including some paid for by overseas groups, have been captured by transparency researchers in the run-up to the vote on May 25th. Ads from both sides of the campaign are still appearing online, despite Facebook’s announcement earlier this month of a ban on foreign-funded ads relating to the abortion referendum.Google followed within days with a total ban on ads related to the referendum. The Transparent Referendum Initiative (TRI), a voluntary initiative established to enable “open, truthful, respectful” debate during the campaign, found 230 new ads served on Facebook last week and said the number of ads was increasing. Data captured by the browsers of about 600 volunteers around the country now includes 224 unique advertiser pages relating to the campaign. Some 43 per cent of the advertisers are registered with, or affiliated with the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo), while 57 per cent were in no way affiliated with that body. Both sides of the campaign were spending on Facebook ads, with an increase in the final weeks. The researchers said some groups were untraceable and that the location, identity or intent of the person paying was not known. There were also overseas organisations paying for ads targeting Irish voters. Activity that would be regulated if it happened offline was also seen by the researchers, who found spending by overseas organisations to influence the vote, untraceable advertising with no accountability for misinformation, and spending to get high quality video ads seen by “hundreds of thousands of people”. TRI founder and transparency specialist Liz Carolan said on Friday the group had spoken to many people to try to figure out how much money was being spent online on the campaigns but said there was “no way of knowing”. “What we can see though is there is a significant amount of activity. We have no idea of how many ads are circulating in this referendum.”She noted a lot of the activity on Facebook was linking people to websites which had the capability to gather a lot of information about undecided voters. This had been seen in other contexts, where the information was cross-populated with other information an organisation had about voters. She said clips from RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live debate on Monday were also being used in some paid ads, sometimes taken out of context and not presenting a balance of views. They were presented almost as “American-style attack ads”, she said.“Those are racking up, within very short periods of time, tens of thousands of views online.”Ms Carolan said she believed there was “a need to go back to first principles on our electoral rules and try and build them so they are fit for purpose”. She said we were at a point before the referendum where there was still time to make sure we were not in the position after it where we were holding parliamentary committees, such as those held in the UK and the US after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.“I think it’s not an exaggeration to say that when two major multinational corporations for the very first time ever withdraw core products from a market because they say it’s too unregulated to operate in, it’s time for us to have a proper response and to treat that as the kind of regulatory crisis that it is.”TRI, working with researchers at the Geary Institute at UCD, found there were a number of advertisers which claimed or tried to appear neutral on the referendum, while demonstrating “bias towards or against one of the sides”. Seven advertisers posting 28 ads which appeared neutral, but which clearly favoured one side, were discovered by the advertisers.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he came to his own conclusion on how Ireland’s abortion laws should be reformed in advance of the Oireachtas committee which shaped the Government’s own proposals.Mr Varadkar largely kept his counsel as the committee conducted his work, and for weeks after it issued its report in December.However, he said on Friday he had reached the same conclusion as the Oireachtas body in advance but independently of the committee process.The committee recommended the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution should be repealed and to permit abortion without restrictions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Mr Varadkar has said legislation would be introduced along these lines if the referendum passes next Friday.The Citizens’ Assembly, which laid the ground for the Oireachtas committee, had also recommended the introduction of abortion without restriction for the first 12 weeks.“I wanted to make sure we had a proper, deliberative process,” the Taoiseach told the Don’t Stop Repealin’ podcast, citing the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee.“It was only after that work was done that I really wanted to let people know about the conclusions about that I had come to as well, which was very much in line with that. I think if I had announced where I was heading earlier I might have been accused of trying to influence or put pressure on members of the all-party committee, which I didn’t do.“Having studied the facts, they came to a similar view as I did, very much independently.”In publicly announcing his position last January, Mr Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.“In making my decision to support it, I listened to the views of others – medical experts, the public, my party and Ministers, friends. Above all, I listened to women. I had to think long and hard about the provision for abortion without a specific indication in the first 12 weeks.”“The Taoiseach’s own views were formed over a period of time. There is no particular day on which they crystallised. He was very much informed by the views of the Citizens’ Assembly, the views of the party, the public, and the all-party committee.

Photograph: Andrew YatesGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to keep Britain aligned with the EU customs union after the end of a post-Brexit transition period has run into resistance from Conservative backbenchers, with former party leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that it should not last more than a month or two.The cabinet agreed this week that the whole of the United Kingdom could remain linked to the customs union beyond the end of 2020 if trade negotiations failed to find a solution that would keep the Irish Border open.Mr Duncan Smith said Brexiteers could accept such a move but only if it was very strictly limited in duration and he warned against agreeing to an extension at this stage in the negotiations.“If they do require to have some kind of backstop, most people will accept that on the basis that it is there for practical reasons but that it is not in any way about the politics, it is wholly about the practicalities,” he told the BBC.“Pre-announcing an extension would be barking mad – you would send a signal to the EU that we don’t know what we want.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the prime minister’s proposal, which she has yet to outline in detail, was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border.“If I was an investor looking to invest in my own constituency here in Rochdale, or for that matter anywhere across Northern Ireland, I’d want a bit more certainty about how long this is going to last,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to have some real fleshing-out, because no hard border is not just for 2019, 2020, it’s got to be into the long future.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week that a plan for customs would not be enough to resolve the Border issue, which would require Britain to retain close ties to the single market too. EU negotiators are sceptical about a customs-only solution, pointing out that border checks would still be needed for regulatory purposes.\u0026nbspBrussels has also made clear that its proposed backstop for Northern Ireland, which would see the North effectively remain in parts of the single market, will not be available to the whole of the UK.Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches are adamant that Britain must not maintain regulatory alignment for goods with the EU after Brexit and that the country must be free to negotiate new, independent trade deals as soon as possible.Following 15 defeats in the House of Lords on the EU Withdrawal Bill, Ms May has nominated nine new Conservative life peers, including a number of former MPs. Since most of the amendments opposed by the government were passed with majorities numbered in the dozens, the appointments will not make a decisive difference to the arithmetic in the upper house.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated three life peers and DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds nominated former mid-Ulster MP William McCrea.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500170.1526644221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"monarchy in the uk the royal family s uncertain future","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLondon barriers decorated with a royal family version of the Top Trumps card game. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday in Windsor Castle. Photograph: Paul EllisAFPGetty ImagesThe transatlantic soap opera surrounding Meghan Markle’s family has added a touch of drama to a royal wedding that has failed to excite most of the British public, according to a poll this week.The YouGov survey, which was commissioned by the anti-monarchist group Republic, found that two out of three respondents were “not very interested” or “not interested at all” in the ceremony, while 60 per cent planned to have a normal weekend.Prince Harry is the most popular member of the royal family, with an approval rating higher than the queen’s, but he is sixth in line to the throne, behind Prince Charles, Prince William and his three children, so his wedding is of no constitutional significance. It will have an economic impact, however, generating more than £1 billion in tourism, retail, fashion, merchandising and PR value for brands, according to accountancy firm Brand Finance.The company, which specialises in intellectual property and publishes an annual assessment of the brand value of the monarchy, found that brands associated with Markle had already gained a significant boost since her engagement was announced last year.“Meghan Markle is an accomplished actress in her own right, with a global popularity and a strong personal brand. It can be expected that, supported by her association with Brand Monarchy, she will become a powerful ambassador for British brands, especially in her native United States.“Although we are observing only the beginnings of a ‘Meghan effect’, Ms Markle will quickly match or even surpass the Duchess of Cambridge in her incredible influence on the fashion industry,” said chief executive David Haigh.Haigh estimates that the monarchy generates about £1.8 billion for the British economy each year, far outstripping the £300-350 million it costs the state. More than a quarter of a century after the queen’s “annus horribilis” of 1992, when Windsor Castle went on fire, Princess Diana’s tell-all book with Andrew Morton was published, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles’s intimate “squidgygate” phone calls were broadcast, and Prince Andrew separated from his wife Sarah Ferguson, the monarchy enjoys solid popular support.“When you talk to people rationally about whether the monarchy makes sense – should we have a monarchy or a republic, should we allow these hereditary people to have a say in the running of the country – when people are talking with their heads, they usually say, no not really. But I think emotionally people act in a different way. They think, oh it’s very nice isn’t it, it’s a great traditional thing and aren’t they nice people, a bit like East Enders. And then the heart kicks in,” Haigh says.Harry and his brother William are more popular than their father and his siblings, especially among the under-40s but it is the queen who, at 92, remains the linchpin of the monarchy. Its supporters are already anxious about the future after she dies.Detailed plans are already in place for the days after her death, including 12 days of public mourning leading up to a state funeral.“I think it’s pretty much tied down. There are various military planning documents that spell out exactly how the funeral will take place. Clearly the BBC and other state broadcasters have preparations for what they do. Most of the plans are predicated on the idea of the queen’s health fading and the announcement of her death being made at a particular time of day, a very controlled way of doing it. That of course is blown sky high if there’s a leak on social media or something,” said one official involved in the planning.“An interesting thing will be what the mood is about how long the BBC plays solemn music, do the newspapers have black edges, when do they start covering other stories. When do normal events start coming back onto the agenda.”After 65 years on the throne, the queen’s reign has been so long that few Britons can remember any other head of state, and the official predicts that, despite her age, the response to her death will be one of deep shock.“I think it’s impossible to overestimate the impact that the queen’s death will have, particularly in the rather febrile world that we live in at the moment. There’s so much uncertainty about Brexit, about international relations, our relationship with the United States, our economy, about our future as a country and our relationship with each other. And the one constant, the one thing that holds it all together is the queen,” he says.“She’s just been so much part of everybody’s life for such a long time, she has maintained this sense of fairness, of honesty, of fair play, of an old Britain that perhaps thinks it’s slightly more important than it is. And I think with her gone, all that is blown out of the water and I think that will hit people almost immediately, that nothing will ever be the same again. I think there’ll be a great baring of souls and fear, in a sense of ‘what happens now?’”The pageantry and deference surrounding the queen, which seems unremarkable in association with her, could feel more like an anachronism under a new monarch. Charles has recovered from his lowest point in the public’s affections after Diana’s death but he remains the most unpopular of the senior royals.This is in part a legacy of his unhappy union with Diana and his subsequent marriage to Camilla, but it also owes something to his record of seeking to influence politicians and his sometimes bad-tempered campaigns in favour of complementary medicine and against modern architecture.The official involved in planning for the succession believes that Charles should make an early gesture towards reducing the scale of the monarchy, bringing it closer to those of Denmark and the Netherlands.“If they’re seen to have too many fripperies, too many luxuries, too many private planes, too many palaces, too many numbing bits of protocol, then that’s where the problems will begin. If they’re sensible, then they’ll immediately trim things back.“The complication is that a lot of it is theirs anyway, and there’s nothing very much that the state can do about it. In a sense, Charles’s Achilles’ heel is his reputation for being lavish, for taking the royal train, for chartering jets, for having six butlers when one would do and having someone to squeeze his toothpaste tube and cut the top off his egg. I think that’s what he’ll need to watch,” he says.“It’s very easy to defend the current monarch and to trot out the line about what she means to Britain’s reputation, what she means for tourism, what she means for our sense of who we are. I think it will be harder to do that for a new monarch, and I think if Charles is sensible, he’ll quite quickly make a couple of gestures, perhaps giving up a palace, perhaps saying that Buckingham Palace is going to become an art gallery to house the royal collection and maybe a state guesthouse but no longer a residence.”A poll last year found that two out of three Britons do not want Camilla to become queen but the official believes she will overcome any remaining hostility to her as they become more familiar with her.“Camilla is in a way the best thing about Charles. She’s very straightforward, she’s down to earth, she likes a joke, she’s got that great, rasping smoker’s cough, she likes a drink. She’s in a sense the person who’s made Charles much less weird,” he says.For Haigh, the biggest threat to the monarchy lies in the personal behaviour of members of the royal family. He fears that the fanfare surrounding Markle’s arrival into the royal family as an American orcee of mixed racial heritage could sound hollow if, like so many recent royal marriages, Harry’s does not endure.“All of the problems that have arisen around Prince Charles and Prince Andrew and Prince Edward and various minor royals, they all come down to their personal behaviour. Whether it’s being accused of taking money where they shouldn’t or giving favours where they shouldn’t or behaving in a bad way or having opinions which are too extreme, there are a lot of personal behavioural issues,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Now I personally think it’s extremely unlikely that Meghan Markle will put a foot wrong. I think the real danger is that for some reason or another they don’t suit each other and eventually they fall out and split.“The other real problem, which is now looming bigger and bigger every day that goes by, is her remarkably dysfunctional family. I must admit that I was really surprised that they completely excluded all her family.“I think if she had invited her family to the wedding, she’d have a better chance of controlling what they do. Instead of which, they’re all going rogue as far as I can see. It’s bonkers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"makings markle debacle family feud almost derailed royal wedding","story":"In many ways, the extraordinary events of the past few days beggar belief.As Britain waits in earnest for the royal wedding in a few hours time – an event destined to whip up a circus at the best of times – a family saga so far-fetched it would not seem out of place if written into a soap opera plot has been playing out.But for many, the remarkable antics of the extended Markle clan will have come as no surprise.Over the past few months, while Britain had its back turned on the American gossip columns carrying details of hate-filled open letters from disgruntled relatives, bitter asides on breakfast television and tawdry kiss-and-tell publishing deals, a chaotic family feud has been brewing....Register for free to read this article, or log in to your  accountRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live updates: Prince Charles to walk Meghan Markle down aisleWhat time is the royal wedding?

Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the Long Walk. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, while park and walk and park and glide bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to get married - latest newsWhat time is the Royal wedding?

That’s the claim being made by a team of 33 researchers published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.They are not referring to aliens in a metaphorical sense, but literal aliens from outer space.Since the paper was released on Sunday, a trickle of news coverage has turned into a torrent, with increasingly alarming headlines about octopuses and their extra-terrestrial origins. Octopus discovered making armour out of shells on Blue Planet IIIt will not come as a surprise to many to learn that these claims have been roundly mocked by the scientific community, who have branded the paper – published in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology – as ridiculous and unscientific.What are the claims being made?They suggest the Cambrian explosion, a sudden burst of life that occurred around 540 million years ago, was the result of extra-terrestrial intervention.\u0026nbspThe paper asks whether this event, which saw the rapid emergence of most of the main animal groups that still exist on Earth today, was “terrestrial or cosmic”. Their conclusion is the latter.How do the scientists suggest this would work?Specifically, the researchers propose the idea that alien viruses crashed to Earth in a meteor, infected a population of primitive squid and caused them to evolve into octopuses.\u0026nbspAnother theory they suggest is that fertilised squid or octopus eggs were delivered to Earth by a meteor.Are octopuses aliens from outer space? This peer-reviewed article by 33 scientists argues that the octopus genome is too complex to have evolved naturally on earth and therefore that octopuses probably came...from space\u0026nbsphttps:t.coR7qE77AGrJ\u0026nbsppic.twittervgDC5vgDz6The idea is essentially a\u0026nbspreimagining\u0026nbspof the “panspermia” hypothesis, which suggests that life on Earth was “seeded” by space dust or asteroids crashing into Earth. One of its first proponents,\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspWickramasinghe, is one of the authors of the new paper.Why do the researchers look at the octopus in particular?Octopuses are weird. They are molluscs, meaning they are closely related to snails, and yet they are incredibly intelligent.\u0026nbspOn top of their large brains and sophisticated nervous systems, the authors of the new paper list camera-like eyes, flexible bodies and ability to camouflage themselves by changing colour and shape as evidence of their extra-terrestrial origins.So suddenly did these features appear in the octopus family tree that “it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant ‘future’ in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large,” the authors write.\u0026nbsp“Such an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm,” they continue. This is a strong contender for understatement of the century.What reason is there to doubt the claims being made in the paper?There are plenty of reasons. First off, as Mark\u0026nbspCarnall\u0026nbspfrom the Oxford University Museum of Natural History pointed out in a series of tweets, not one of the paper’s authors is a zoologist.\u0026nbspMuch of the authors’ speculation rests on the idea that the genetics of octopuses and their relatives are mysterious – yet a\u0026nbsp2015 paper published in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsprevealed the octopus genome, so this is rather disingenuous.In fact, octopus genes suggest they fit into the generally understood theory of the evolution of life on Earth, and require no alien invasion. They are thought to have split from the squid lineage around 135 million years ago.Molecular geneticist Professor\u0026nbspKarin\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspof the Max Planck Institute Molecular Genetics, who was asked to review the report, concluded that it cannot be taken seriously”.The primary reason for doubt given by Professor\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspis that there is “no evidence at all”.Haven’t I heard something about octopuses being aliens before?Writers are fond of comparing octopuses to aliens due to their unusual appearance and great intelligence. Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith, who has written a book about octopus intelligence titled\u0026nbspOther Minds, has described them as “the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”.On top of that, this is not the first time octopuses have been mistakenly labelled aliens by the press.\u0026nbspAn unfortunately worded press release concerning the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper describing the octopus genome led to a slew of online news pieces in 2015 about researchers finding “alien DNA” in these creatures.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

In Brinsley, Notts, for example a mock royal wedding will take place, with kiddies plonked on a Shetland pony on their way to the church, almost like the real thing. Meanwhile, Margate’s Dreamland amusement park will emulate Windsor’s royal chapel with an inflatable bouncy church and free entry for anyone named Harry, Meghan or wearing a wedding dress (or all three). You might also try a giant live-screen event in the medieval grandeur of Winchester Cathedral or the one at Wembley’s Designer Outlet or screenings at the Southbank Centre and the Skylight rooftop bar in Tobacco Dock, most, admittedly, in London.  Live updates on the build-up to the Royal WeddingThe betrothal of HRH Prince Henry of Wales and Ms Meghan Markle off of Suits is what telly folk have been looking forward to all year, even if their viewers haven’t. So the broadcasters will be throwing their best assets into the coverage, which takes over BBC1, BBC News, ITV, and Sky News all day. Even though she’s been round this particular block a few times, Kay Burley’s breathless joyfulness at meeting another pensioner in a union jack outfit is always, well, breathlessly joyful, and balanced by the encyclopaedically knowledgeable and calm Alastair Bruce. Huw Edwards takes on the role of BBC Silvery Haired Dimbleby-in-Waiting. What those guys don’t know about royal carriages isn’t worth knowing. ITV is making do with Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham, as their trump card, Tom Bradby, who actually knows the Royal Fab Four, has been unwell, though there are reports he will be a guest at the wedding.How to avoid it1. Pubs, the theatre, exhibitions – life goes on…Even in a Britain infected with a sort of royal fever, there are some who are immune to it, and will be looking for other distractions. Best choice of all would be a day spent at the The Alexandra Hotel in Derby, which has banned mention of Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and will fine (for charity) anyone heard mentioning them, and is a wedding-free zone – indeed the bar will be closing at its usual time of midnight rather than taking advantage of the general licensing hours extension to 1am.  Eccentrically, you could head down to the lovely Theatre Royal, Windsor, where there is an outside chance you can get a ticket for the highly appropriate Horrible Histories Live: More Best of Barmy Britain, featuring the likes of Elizabeth I and Henry VIII. So then you can claim you met “royals” at Windsor on the Big Day.Almost as unconventionally you could follow the true path of Diana worship and relive the glamour of her era, at the exhibition of her style and fashions being held at Kensington Palace. There’s also the Museums at Night festival, where some of the most inspiring museums including the National Gallery and Keats House are open into the night as part of the event.2. Hit the roadGiven that the great majority of the population is going be watching TV andor drunk, the roads (apart from around Windsor) will be blissfully clear for a nice long drive. Suggestions would be the A149 North Norfolk coastal route past Sandringham, listening to North Norfolk Radio, of course the A93 from Perth to Royal Deeside, taking in Balmoral and the magnificent A4086, from Capel Curig to Caernarfon, which also has an inoffensive tangential royal connection. An alternative would be take the rare opportunity to circumnavigate in a near deserted M25 in daytime a little over an hour each for the clockwise and anti-clockwise legs will tick that one off the old bucket list. For the highly, ambitious, you could try fitting all of them in over a long weekend.    3, Er, just change TV channelsYou don’t need to get on a flight to Fiji to escape the wedding (and that might not even work such is its global appeal). For there are plenty of telly alternatives, and there are some left-field choices. None more left-field than BBC Parliament’s rerun of Prime Ministers Questions, which features, by common consent, an unusually strong performance by the left-field monarch-sceptic Jeremy Corbyn. (The leader of the opposition, by the way, won’t be watching the wedding live, but on catch-up, apparently). You may instead like the look of London Live’s alternative, a classic movie about the Second World War the Malta Story (1953), featuring the incomparable Sir Alec Guinness (it’s available outside the capital online). Homeless charity enraged as police impound bus ahead of royal weddingChannel 4, who once gave us an alternative Queen’s speech with Quentin Crisp seems to have given up on the satire, sticking a triple bill of The Simpsons on instead. The brilliant thing would have been a special edition of The Simpsons starring all the Windsors and the Markle clans in their colourful glory. But, then again, maybe that is precisely the point of the royal wedding. Conversation for the royalistsThese are fairly obvious, and will be endlessly churned during the coverage on the day, but here is a short checklist for the topics:1. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is setting new standards for restrained good taste and 10 is WTF awful, how ridiculous are Beatrice and Eugenie’s hatsfascinators? 2. Isn’t the 96-year old Duke of Edinburgh doing well on his new hip ? 3. Where does Meghan’s wedding dress rank in the pantheon of frocks running from, say, Princess Elizabeth in 1947 through Margaret (1960), Anne (1973 and 1992), Diana (1981), Fergiana (1986), Sophie (1999), Camilla (2005) and Kate (2011). Ditto the ring, the kiss, the size of the crowd. 4. How’s Pippa looking (front and rear)? 5. The Palace shouldshould not have done more for Meghan’s family to protect them from the media and the paps (caution: this could take all day).6. Starting with Prince Charles, how far down the order of succession to the throne can you get without recourse to Wikipedia? Can you make it to Zenouska Mowatt (number 57)? Conversation for the republicans1. How should an elected head of state be chosen: direct vote of the people by parliament, or Commons alone by exhaustive ballot or resolution of the house by a Labour Party-style electoral college including the unions via online poll by Simon Cowell and Tom Jones by a Congress of People’s Soviets?2. Try and think of the best offensive headline for a fantasy left-wing paper front page, based on some classics from the Morning Star and Socialist Worker from the 1980s, eg “Parasite Marries Scrounger” (Sarah Ferguson and Andrew) or “Noddy to Wed Big Ears” (Diana Spencer and Charles). 3. Is the biracial Meghan a step forwards or backwards for progressive politics?4. Who is paying for all this?​​TV coverage of the royal wedding starts from 9amor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It emphasises direct democracy and sits in Ukip’s group in the European parliament.Friday’s joint programme makes no mention of the parties’ stance on the EU or the euro, leaving the situation ambiguous.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen.

It\u0026rsquos really important in China that change is also seen to come from within.HSI says it is urging central and local government to implement an action plan to crack down on Yulin with road blocks before the festival starts so that trucks stuffed with dogs and cats can be stopped from entering the city.It also wants temporary emergency shelters, run in partnership with expert animal groups with the veterinary skills, to be set up to care for confiscated animals as well as a nationwide public information campaign to alert dog traders that they will stopped from entering Yulin and face punishment.Humane Society InternationalThere are calls for authorities to provide packages for dog meat traders to move into new business.There are also calls for authorities to provide packages for dog meat traders to move them into new business.\u0026ldquoUntil the dog traders invented the Yulin festival in 2010, there was no history of dog eating in the city and so it\u0026rsquos entirely feasible to help traders move on, added Ms Higgins.\u0026ldquoUltimately, of course, China needs a robust animal protection law because right now there is nothing to protect these animals from harm at all."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/959418_1.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding 2018 news Meghan Markle faux pas Prince Harry Saturday","story":"As Britain officially heads into the sunny wedding season, so will Prince Harry and Meghan tie the knot at St George\u0026rsquos Chapel, Windsor, today on Saturday May 19.Meghan is expected to steal the show later this afternoon with an affectionate speech about her husband-to-be.However, a team of researchers have now told\u0026nbspExpress\u0026nbspthings could go incredibly awry for the bride if she commits one of the many wedding cardinal sins.A study of 2,000 Britons, commissioned by Pimm\u0026rsquos ahead of wedding season, has found wedding guests do not take very kindly to wedding cliches and speech\u0026nbspfaux pas.

On the back of the stalls are nearly 800 plates which commemorate Knights of the Garter past and present.On the High Altar is a jewelled Cross, given by Queen Victoria, and two silver gilt candlesticks dating from the reign of King Charles II.Also displayed are three gilt dishes of very great size, elaborately embossed one was intended to have been the gift of Mary of Orange, sister of King Charles II, while the other two smaller dishes are the gift of Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, wife of the future King James II.Looking down on the Quire from above is the wooden oriel window installed in the Chantry Chapel of King Edward IV by King Henry VIII so that his Queen, Katherine of Aragon, might watch the ceremonies of the Installation of Knights of the Garter in the Quire below.The window bears the arms of Henry and Katherine and the intertwined Tudor Rose of England and the Pomegranate of Aragon.It has frequently been used as a Royal Pew or watching chamber and it was from this vantage point that Queen Victoria watched the wedding in the Chapel below of her son, the Prince of Wales, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863.It was at this same wedding that the fine East Window, created by Messrs Clayton and Bell in commemoration of the late Prince Albert, was first seen.The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby, Archbishop of CanterburyPRAYERGOD of love,send your blessing upon Harry and Meghan,and all who are joined in marriage,that, rejoicing in your willand continuing under your protection,they may both live and growin your love all their days,through Jesus Christ our Lord.AmenThe service is led by The Right Reverend David Conner KCVO, Dean of Windsor.The marriage is solemnised by The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury.The service is sung by the choir of St George\u0027s Chapel, conducted by Mr James Vivian, Director of Music, St George\u0027s Chapel.

No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God. HARRY and MEGHAN are now to enter this way of life.They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring.We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God\u0027s purposes for the whole of their earthly life together.All stand.The service is sung by the choir of St George\u0026rsquos Chapel.THE HYMNLORD of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy,Whose trust, ever child-like,no cares could destroy,Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray,Your bliss in our hearts, Lord,at the break of the day.Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,Whose strong handswere skilled at the plane and the lathe,Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray,Your strength in our hearts, Lord,at the noon of the day.Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,Your hands swift to welcome,your arms to embrace,Be there at our homing, and give us, we pray,Your love in our hearts, Lord,at the eve of the day.Jan Struther (1901-53) \u0027Slane\u0027, Traditional Irish MelodyAll remain standing as the Archbishop leadsExplore London like Meghan and Harry with this pick of London spots connected to the royal couple                    Instagram1 of 16Chelsea in Bloom is one of the attractions London\u0027s King\u0026rsquos Road has to offerTHE DECLARATIONSFIRST, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.The Archbishop says to the CoupleTHE vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.The Archbishop says to the BridegroomHARRY, will you take MEGHAN to be your wife?Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?He answersI will.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend an Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey.The Archbishop says to the BrideMEGHAN, will you take HARRY to be your husband?Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?She answersI will.The Archbishop says to the congregationWILL you, the families and friends of HARRY and MEGHAN, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?All answerWe will.The Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he saysMeghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026rsquos love story in pictures.

Few would deny that it has been a bumpy week for Meghan, when she might have hoped to spend her time quietly preparing for what is going to be a momentous wedding day.I need no convincing that Windsor likes a royal occasion but the undoubted goodwill towards bride and groom combined with perfect early summer weather has transformed this castle town into a maelstrom of activity.Overshadowing all this was the \u0026ldquowill-he? won\u0026rsquot he? drama of poor Mr Markle, the bride\u0026rsquos father.In the end a combination of stress, ill-health, shame at being caught in a well-meaning if ill- conceived attempt to present himself as an involved father, culminated in the news that he was not coming.Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0026rsquos mother, will still accompany her from Cliveden on the journey along the Long Walk.Prince Charles knows his way up that aisle.In June 1968 he processed in to be installed as a Knight of the Garter, and in 2005 he escorted Camilla Parker Bowles to the High Altar for the service of blessing.It was always said that he regretted not having a daughter of his own, but he has stepped in before, when Lord Brabourne was not well enough to escort his daughter Alexandra to the altar in Romsey Abbey in 2016, though Brabourne was present with his wife Penny.Prince Charles looked delighted as he steered the bride gently by the hand.\u0026nbspOn that occasion he was described as a \u0026ldquohigh class substitution.The same applies today.Prince Charles as he tours the world for his royal visits.

A solution to that is they all go out wearing balaclavas.Mr Thomson, speaking in a podcast, said satellite tags were 25 times more likely to fail suddenly and mysteriously in Scotland than any other country in the world, suggesting the birds were being killed and the transmitters destroyed.\u0026nbspThe missing birds of prey including golden eagles and sea eagles (pictured)And he called for stronger deterrents for criminals who believe they are \u0026ldquoindestructible.

These crimes are taking place in the middle of nowhere where witnesses are few and far between, where finding the evidence to prove that that bird was killed by that person is well nigh impossible.Mr Thomson said Scotland is considerably further ahead of the rest of the UK, however, in terms of developing and strengthening legislation, and putting in place other potential sanctions and deterrents.He added: \u0026ldquoI am accused often by representatives of the gamekeeping or the landowning fraternity saying, \u0026lsquoYou just want gamekeepers sent to prison\u0026rsquo.

But what is her real name?She is known around the world as Meghan Markle - with fans stunned by the revelation her real name is actually Rachel.It is the same as her character in hit US TV show Suits, where she plays paralegal-turned-lawyer Rachel Zane.It is unknown which name her soon-to-be husband Prince Harry calls her by.The Queen let slip as she officially blessed the couples marriage, saying: “My Lords, I declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between My Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle, which Consent I am causing to be signified under the Great Seal and to be entered in the Books of the Privy Council.”Its not unusual for celebrities to change their names for the stage.Meghans in company with Elton John, Katy Perry and Jamie Foxx, who all famously swapped their first names for more glamorous monikers.Even Prince Harry goes by a different name to the one he was born with.His birth name is Henry Charles Albert David, and his official title is Prince Henry of Wales. The official announcement revealed that the pair became engaged in London in November 2017.It read: Prince Harry has informed Her Majesty the Queen and other close members of his family. Prince Harry has also sought and received the blessing of Ms Markles parents.The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said they were delighted for their grandson and his bride-to-be, and wish them every happiness.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge added: We are very excited for Harry and Meghan. It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and to see how happy she and Harry are together.The Royal Wedding is taking place today.The ceremony is to be held at St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle.After their wedding, the couple will live together in Harrys current home, Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace.Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry and joining the Windsors.She is expected to become a duchess - just like Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.But unlike Kate, Ms Markle is not a future queen. With the arrival of the Cambridges children, Harry is too far down the line of succession to have a realistic prospect of being monarch.Ms Markle will most probably become HRH the Duchess of Sussex, if Harry is made the Duke of Sussex by the Queen on the morning of his wedding."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000394024049.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding guest list invited meghan markle prince harry","story":"The Royal Wedding is sure to be a star-studded affair, with the couple having many high-profile pals. Heres what we know about who will be attending the big day.The wedding invitations were printed on March 22, and the couple have kept fairly tight-lipped about their guest list.There wont be as many wedding guests as when Prince William tied the knot in 2011, but it has been confirmed that Harrys older brother will be the best man.Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, with 1,900 guests but St Georges chapel, Harry and Meghans venue, can hold 800 people.They have also invited 2,640 members of the public on the day to the Windsor Castle grounds including 1,200 people, who have demonstrated strong leadership in their communities. Around 600 people have been invited to the service which takes place at St Georges Chapel on Saturday May 19.Unfortunately those wanting a glimpse of Prince Louis on the day will be disappointed, as the palace has confirmed he wont be attending - instead being cared for by a nanny nearby on the day.It was confirmed on May 16 that Prince George will be page boy and Princess Charlotte will be a bridesmaid at the Royal Wedding.On Harrys invite list were ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, it is likely some Army comrades who he served alongside in Afghanistan also made the cut.Meghans older half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr and Samantha Markle, have not be invited on the big day.Her nephew, Thomas Jrs son Tyler Dooley, and his mum Tracey Dooley, are also rumoured to have been left off the guest list. Meghans mum, Doria Ragland, will be attending, and her father, Thomas Markle Sr, had plananed to walk his daughter down the aisle.However, on May 14, US media reported that he had been struck down by a heart problem and pulled out of the ceremony after realising he might be too ill to make the trip.It has since been reported that Thomas Sr underwent heart surgery on May 16, and while the operation was successful, he will not be attending his daughters nuptials.On May 17, Meghan released an official statement via Kensington Palace confirming her father will not be attending the ceremony on Saturday to focus on his health.All three of Princess Dianas siblings will be in attendance - Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer.Lady Jane Fellowes will be giving the reading.A fleet of glamorous pals including tennis ace Serena Williams, Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, stylist Jessica Mulroney and Made In Chelsea’s Millie Mackintosh were believed to have been in the running for bridesmaid duty, but it has since been revealed that Meghans bridesmaids are all children and she will not have a maid of honour.Protocol normally means that royal brides do not have adult bridesmaids, although Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton was an obvious exception to this rule.At the very least, we expect to see a few of Meghan’s mates as guests at the wedding – as well as fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who’s thought to be the woman who set her and Harry up.And several of her Suits co-stars have been spotted in London ahead of the event - Patrick J Adams (who plays her on-screen love interest), Rick Hoffman, Vanessa Ray, Gina Torres and Gabriel Macht. Sarah Rafferty has been posting photographs from a family trip in Europe.Its inevitable that the wedding will be attended by a host of foreign royals.One man who seemed determined to get an invite is Anthony Joshua, one of Harrys guests during his special Radio 4 appearance – and he wants a starring role.It has also been reported that two of Prince Harrys former flames, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy have both scored invites.Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and his wife, Princess Mabereng, who have worked alongside the Prince and his charity Sentebale since 2006, will also attend.In addition to Donald Trump, a whole host of political big names including President Obama, his wife Michelle, and Theresa May have reportedly not made the cut.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: It has been decided that an official list of political leaders - both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms Markles wedding.Her Majestys Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.The Sun has revealed that Elton John will be attending the Royal Wedding.The Rocket Man has cancelled two Las Vegas gigs on the same May weekend as the royal nuptials, which leaves him free to attend or even perform.The singer was a close friend of Harry’s mum Princess Diana and was among a handful of celebrities to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.It was the same venue where he famously sang Candle in the Wind at Diana’s funeral in 1997.Mel B was speaking on US talk show The Real when she confirmed that all five of the Spice Girls were invited to the wedding.Unfortunately, Scary Spice did not budge when she was asked about the invitation or other details around the wedding.Mel sternly said: “Im not saying any more,” but when she was asked whether they would perform or not, she grinned and looked down at her hands.Victoria Beckham, aka Posh Spice, also confirmed she had received a coveted invitation.It was reported that the couple were keen to invite Barack Obama to the wedding rather than Trump - which had all the makings of a sticky political situation.The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with Obama and his wife Michelle since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.But government mandarins had pleaded with the couple to change their minds as Britains relations with Trumps White House sank to their lowest ebb since his election last year.And as the big day approaches, the ushers, bridesmaids and page boys have been revealed.Ushers:Bridesmaids:Page boys:The Sun Online exclusively revealed that Lady Amelia Windsor has been snubbed by the royal couple and she is not invited to the wedding.The Edinburgh student and her older sister Marina, 25, have failed to bag an invitation to the wedding of the year.A friend said: “They were a little surprised not to be invited as they were looking forward to going.“Amelia is creating quite a name for herself with her modelling and Instagram posts.“Perhaps Harry just wanted to keep the family invited to a small number or maybe he didn’t want anyone upstaging the bride.”Lady Amelia and Lady Marina are William and Harrys third cousins - granddaughters of the Duke of Kent who is the Queens cousin.Numerous members of the public are selected to watch outside the chapel when the couple get married. These include:The Suns Bizarre column exclusively revealed that the Foo Fighters have dropped hints they want to perform at the wedding.Frontman Dave Grohl said: “I’ve saved the date. The performance was good. It’s nice to feel like a wedding band when everyone’s at tables eating tiramisu.”The band, who picked up Best International Group at the Brit Awards 2018, played at Harry’s Invictus Games in 2014.Some performers have already been confirmed such as cello please Sheku Kanneh-Mason. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It doesn’t free us to be the global trader she wants. Boris Johnson’s “Max Fac” does — but it will take time.The bigger problem, though, is the EU. Negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly says the Tories are wasting their breath since he intends to reject either solution.He is stoking the Irish border problem and privately mocking Mrs May’s discomfort. It is dangerously destructive. We should challenge Brussels to help us make Boris’s solution work. If it won’t help, we should walk away. It would be bad for the EU, Barnier and us. But it looks more inevitable by the day.SIXTY dead, thousands allegedly wounded. The Gaza bloodbath should horrify even Israel’s staunchest supporters.It is hard to argue that shooting live rounds into a crowd is proportionate. But consider the terrifying threat Israel faces. This was not a peaceful demo. Hamas, the terror group sworn to wipe Israel off the map, aims to use it to penetrate the border and kidnap Jews.“We will tear out their hearts,” its leader has said. Some Jewish families live near the fence. Israel is right to fear for them.But its ruthlessness has handed Hamas the PR coup it cynically craves.MPs have again spared the Press and public a costly new “Leveson 2” witch-hunt.We congratulate Culture Secretary Matt Hancock and the 301 MPs who put Press freedom first. We doubt the rest, the Lords or Hacked Off will ever call it a day. But the media has changed beyond recognition since the last inquiry. Facebook and Google dominate. Newspapers are fighting for life.Campaigners should refocus away from their grudges and the distant past.It is more important to consider how a viable, noisy free Press can survive.THE vast sums blown on misguided ­Government environment obsessions are a monumental scandal.One £23billion scheme launched in 2011 to help people install heating systems using renewables was a huge flop.A Commons committee says forecasts were wildly over-optimistic, yet the Energy Department has since learned no lessons from it.Some politicians shouldn’t be trusted to boil a kettle, let alone run an energy budget worth billions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not. Yet it’s all I’ve heard about on the news recently.I’m not being mean. I hope they all have a lovely day.But I couldn’t give a monkey’s if Meghan was led up the aisle by her dad, or Piers Morgan, or a flock of cackling greylag geese.In truth, Meghan and the royals aside, does anyone else?ISRAEL has over-reacted in trying to control the Palestinians rioting by the border fence.It’s handed a huge propaganda coup to the racist terrorists of Hamas. They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people. Even if they are bombarded with Molotov cocktails.It’s still the case that the biggest barrier to peace is Hamas, not Israel.LIKE you, I’m working on my hip cleavage so I’ll look dead good on the beach this summer.I’m going to have my bikini bottom glued somewhere just below my armpits, in order to look like Bella Hadid or Genie Bouchard or Alessandra Ambrosio.It all reminds me of the old joke. Young bloke complains that no girls on the beach fancy him. Won’t even look at him.So his friend advises: “Put a couple of potatoes in your trunks. Then they’ll look.”Young bloke comes back the next day and says: “It’s even worse. Now they run away from me.”His friend looks at his trunks and says: “I meant put the potatoes down the FRONT of your trunks, not the back.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s based on a couple of premises not a single country would be able to accept.“The costs are big and even then you don’t end up with a smooth border. You could perhaps have Max Fac in 2085, but it’s not readily available now or even in three to five years. It would be the miracle solution.”The official said the UK and EU could agree to either change the end date for the transition, currently set for December 2020, or to roll it over until an answer is found.They said: “There’s no legal limit, so in truth it will be a political decision in the end. It would be a bit more complicated if it’s really indefinite in time.”And they insisted EU leaders will not let the UK crash out without a deal given the risks that would pose to their economies.They revealed: “Leaders won’t want to take any additional risk that would dampen growth even more. There’s still a lot of common sense out there.”They made the remarks as it emerged Brexiteers have lost the battle within Cabinet over keeping us in the Customs Union beyond 2021.Ministers have thrashed out the compromise as an alternative to Brussels’ backstop proposal, which would see Northern Ireland stay in the Single Market and Customs Union.But it is likely to be immediately rejected by Eurocrats, who will insist the UK must extend the whole transition if it cannot find another way to avoid a hard border.They will also demand that Britain still signs up to a legal promise of a backstop regardless, with trust between the two sides over the issue at rock bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the “transition” was time-limited. This effectively extends that. When would it ever end? When the EU finally decides it is happy for new technology to monitor the Irish border.Never, in other words.It is already sneering it will take till 2085. It will use any excuse.We are told Britain would be free to sign trade deals during that time. But how could we negotiate without the flexibility to diverge from EU rules?We would be nominally “out”, yet forever marching in lockstep with it over trade. “Perpetual purgatory”, as Jacob Rees-Mogg rightly calls it.Theresa May is under huge pressure. But this is not seizing the opportunity Brexit presents. It is defeatism, attempted damage limitation without realising the REAL damage of a half-Brexit.The Cabinet is running scared of Brussels and Tory Remainers, as the EU ratchets up the panic.The alternative is to leave with no deal. But we are failing abjectly to prepare for that.It will cost us dear.IT is a national disgrace that shale gas was successfully demonised by a ­campaign of hysteria and lies.This is a potentially immense energy resource beneath our feet which could power the country cheaply for decades.But eco warriors’ baseless scaremongering about the environmental risks, amplified by social media and grossly irresponsible politicians, has prevailed.The tall tales were debunked, but the public remains afraid of fracking.We salute the Government, then, for finally grasping the nettle with measures to help firms explore for shale and compel councils to approve it.Not long ago we were self-sufficient for energy. Now we partly rely on the murderous, flaky Putin regime’s gas. We have to get cracking with fracking, like the US.And the Government must launch a PR offensive to convince a doubting nation it is clean and safe.IT would be insane not to ban combustible cladding on tower blocks after Grenfell.And it should be mandatory to test panels physically.We know the tragedy had several causes. We accept Dame Judith Hackitt’s damning view of a building regulations system unfit for purpose.But 71 people died. Why risk more lives with dodgy panels?The Government is already spending £400million removing them nationwide.It must thank Dame Judith for her report — then swiftly take far tougher action than she has in mind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It needs to change to survive.Prime Minister Theresa May won as many votes last year as Margaret Thatcher did in her prime.She earned the party its biggest share of working-class votes since 1979.The Conservatives are now back ahead in the polls.But across some of the parts of the population that are growing the fastest, the Conservatives are still trailing behind Labour.In last year’s General Election, Jeremy Corbyn’s Little Red Book did not just win over university students.He also won over half of people in their thirties.A recent poll showed only nine per cent of those aged 25 to 39 say they will definitely vote Conservative.The Conservatives are behind among people who rent their homes privately — and there are twice the number doing that as there were in 2000.Nearly four times as many people from ethnic minority communities voted Labour than voted Tory — and those different communities are a growing part of our population.So if the Conservative Party does not broaden its reach, it is finished. It is that simple.That does not mean the Prime Minister should copy Corbyn’s empty promises.Let’s not forget that Labour’s most recent manifesto proposed to raise taxes to their highest level since World War Two.Or that Corbyn’s plans to borrow huge, unprecedented sums of money to embark on a spending spree would put a millstone of debt around the necks of younger people.Or that the only thing he wants to cut is our defence budget — and from the Falklands to Russia, he has a bad habit of siding with Britain’s enemies.The Tories have spent eight years cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. We do not want to repeat their mistakes.We remember the dangerous situation where the Government was borrowing a quarter of all the money it spent.We did the hard yards slashing the dole queues Labour left behind, and now we have got more people in work than ever before.But we can not just rest on our record. There are five big challenges we need to solve if we are going to deserve the votes of Sun readers at the next election.The FIRST is obvious — we have to make a success of Brexit. We should ignore pompous members of the House of Lords who say we should just override the democratic result of the referendum.But we should make sure we listen when businesses and exporters say they want sensible arrangements to keep business flowing between Britain and Europe. That’s exactly what the PM is negotiating.The SECOND is to give young people at least the same chances to get on in life that older people have enjoyed.That means reversing 15 years of falling home ownership and building more homes that young working people can afford.But it also means reforming taxes to focus on growing the number of homeowners, not just expanding the amount of rented property.The THIRD challenge is to build a united Britain and make the Conservative Party feel like the natural home for working people, whatever their race or religion.We believe we must continue to strongly control immigration and stop illegal immigration. But we also believe in making sure everyone can feel part of Britain.We admire those who have come here with nothing and built amazing businesses — and we know that the Conservative priorities of enterprise, family and education are often their priorities, too.Many feel very patriotic about this great country that is now their home. That is why we, as a party, must do much more to reach out to ethnic minority communities.It is why, in government, we must make sure that everyone, no matter their background, gets help to speak good English so they can get a good job and be part of a united country.FOURTH, we need to do much more to help places that have suffered in recent decades. Not just by aiding big cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham — some of which are now growing faster than London.But also by tackling deprivation in the neglected smaller towns and coastal communities where opportunities have been hard to come by for years.FIFTH, we must build an economy that really does work for everyone, not just the well-off.It is brilliant that unemployment is at a 40-year low. But wages fell a long way in the last recession and though they are growing, working people have been through a very difficult decade.Policies such as the National Living Wage and tax cuts for the lower-paid have helped those who want to work, earn more and keep more of their earnings.But now we have to find ways to raise average wages and help businesses invest in their workers.Government should be taking more of a role in helping people to retrain between jobs or to work in new industries to reduce the impact of new technology.And we must do more to help working families with everyday costs of living. That means cutting high energy bills and helping working families who face some of the most expensive childcare in the developed world.If we do these things and govern always in the interests of working people, we can beat Corbyn’s tried-and-failed 1970s politics.By becoming the party for working people, the Conservative Party can earn a solid majority and make Britain fairer — and more united.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At that point I decided to just walk away.”The photograph shows a grey-haired man with his pants down.Holding a piece of toilet paper, he is squatting over a concrete path by a brick wall and looking in the direction of the camera.Steve has since discovered that the man is married, and lives in a well-kept house with a manicured garden not far from the apartment block in the southeastern Brisbane suburb of Greenslopes.Steve wrote on Facebook that the man was a Greenslopes resident but he was “not sharing his name at this stage, unless he continues to do it”.“Hopefully someone (either friend, acquaintance or even his employer) will recognise him,” the commenter said.“I can see no reasonable excuse for his filthy and disgusting behaviour. The fact that he has done this on numerous occasions makes it even worse!”.Steve has distributed the poster in a local letter drop to houses including the one in which the poo jogger lives.Last year, a female jogger in Colorado dubbed the Mad Pooper left a family at their wits end when she repeatedly defecated in front of their home.He said that the man ran past on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, but did not stop to relieve himself on the path every time.“He ran straight past on Monday,” Steve said.He and other neighbours had tried to talk to the man, to no avail.Facebook users suggested having a police car outside the apartment block, and another said he hoped the photograph would “shame the police to take it seriously”.But it was pointed out that, at best, the man could be charged with trespass and be served with a notice.“As it is on private property the police cannot really do anything. If he was crapping like this on public property, he could be charged with disorderly behaviour,” a Facebook poster wrote.Steve told news.au he had been hoping police could go and have a talk with the man, but was now hoping the photograph might deter him from doing it again.This article originally appeared on news.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406952490-e1526634010461.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding time full schedule events step by step guide may 19","story":"The Royal Wedding Ceremony will be closely watched by the couples family and friends.

So I can do what I want!” And he made the most of it.Harry’s cheeky sense of humour and ­happy-go-lucky nature made him instantly lovable.Trying to make life “normal”, Diana took her boys to theme parks, ­fast-food joints and trips to the cinema.As they got older, ­visits to Aids clinics, homeless shelters and kids’ charities showed the boys how other people lived.But even Diana’s patience was tested by the young prince.Inspector Ken Wharfe, who looked after the young princes and Diana, says the angriest he ever saw her was when she was telling off Harry for hitting William with a snooker cue while they stayed on Richard Branson’s Caribbean island Necker.He said: “Harry was always pushing the boundaries. That was never the case with William.”Harry was not academic and struggled with his schooling.He started at Mrs Mynors’ ­nursery school in London’s Notting Hill in 1987 before going to ­Wetherby School in 1989.He began boarding at Ludgrove Prep in 1992. While there he was told his parents were separating — they divorced in 1996.The fallout of Charles and Diana’s ­marriage ending had a big impact on their sons.But Diana’s death in August 1997, when Harry was just 12, changed him for life.Struggling with this tremendous loss, on September 6, 1997, Prince Harry walked past thousands of people who had gathered to say goodbye to the woman many had dubbed “the People’s Princess.”He trailed behind his mother’s coffin in the funeral procession along with his brother, father and grandfather Prince Philip.He was held back a year at Ludgrove before passing the entrance exam to Eton in 1998.Like other teens, Harry liked to party — and he hit the headlines in 2001 and 2002 for drinking and smoking pot.He spent a gap year travelling through Africa, Argentina and Australia in 2003.He started ­dating Zimbabwean Chelsy Davy in 2004 and their on-off relationship would last until 2011.Harry enrolled at Sandhurst in 2005 to train in the Army.In April 2006, he joined the Household Cavalry as a Blues and Royals officer.He spent ten very happy years in the Army, latterly as an Apache helicopter ­gunner, and secretly completed two tours of ­Afghanistan before leaving in 2015.In April 2014 he split with actress Cressida Bonas, his second serious girlfriend.Harry went on a blind date in June 2016 with American actress Meghan Markle . . . and they got engaged in November last year.With his party exploits in the past, Harry is now best known for his charity work and founding the Invictus Games for injured troops.Im proud of who I am... a confident womanRACHEL MEGHAN MARKLE was raised mostly by her mum, Doria Ragland, in Los Angeles.Doria and Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, got divorced when she was six.It was a second marriage for Tom, who has children Samantha and Tom ­Jnr with his first wife, Roslyn Loveless.Describing her heritage, Meghan said: “My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African-American.“I’m half-black and half-white. I have come to embrace (this and) say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident, mixed-race woman.”The young Meghan found it quite tough to split her time between social worker and yoga instructor Doria and dad Tom, ­a ­Hollywood lighting director.But she enjoyed spending time with him on set and he paid to send her to private school.Meghan attended the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse primary and the all-girls ­Catholic Immaculate Heart High School.And she developed an outspoken voice at a young age.Aged 11, she wrote to then First Lady Hillary Clinton and the ­makers of a TV advert that ­featured the line: “Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.”When her male classmates saw the ad and yelled that the kitchen is where women belonged, Meghan complained about what she saw as the slogan’s sexist assumption.She was delighted when her letter-writing campaign led to the ad’s wording being changed from “women” to “people”.Meghan — who was born on August 4, 1981, and shares a birthday with Prince Harry’s great-grandmother the Queen Mum — went on to study theatre and international relations at Northwestern University School of Communication.She graduated in 2003.As an aspiring actress, she struggled at first to make ends meet, waitressing and appearing as a game show glamour girl in the US ­version of Deal Or No Deal.In 2002, Meg landed her first TV acting role with a guest spot on daytime soap General Hospital.She went on to appear in a number of other series, including sitcoms Cuts and The War At Home, as well as the dramas CSI:NY and 90210.As a biracial actress, Meghan would later talk about the ­challenges of trying to get cast in racially specific roles while also finding her voice as a performer.Her big break came in 2011 when she ­landed the part of ­paralegal Rachel Zane on the US series Suits, which co-starred Gabriel Macht, Patrick J Adams and Gina Torres.The show became a top ­performer among USA Network’s scripted programmes.Set in a Manhattan corporate law firm, the legal drama sees savvy Zane attending Columbia Law School to pursue her dreams of becoming an attorney.Meghan left the show last year after filming her on-screen wedding.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKShe also founded a popular lifestyle blog called The Tig.

Sources said the meeting at Windsor Castle went “very well”.Asked how she was feeling last night, Meghan, in a £1,350 navy Roland Mouret Barwick dress, said: “Wonderful, thank you.”However Meghan — like Prince Harry — was said to be suffering the “normal nerves” of any couple getting married.A royal source said: “They are both ready. The last couple of days all their friends have been arriving.“Everything has started to feel very real after a long time planning. All weddings are complicated to plan, and something on this scale is completely different. They have made every decision.”Meghan’s dad Thomas pulled out of the big day so late that the order of service — revealed today — still says he will be walking his daughter down the aisle.Sources said Charles offered to step in instead — despite official claims that Meghan asked him.Kensington Palace said in a statement yesterday: “Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George’s Chapel on her Wedding Day.“The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.”Doria had been tipped to perform the role but Charles is vastly experienced at appearing in large-scale public events amid intense security.He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, daughter of his friend Lord Brabourne in 2016.It is understood Harry was also involved in the discussions.Meghan and her “glam squad” of best girlfriends, including stylist Jessica Mulroney and TV producer Lindsay Roth, have taken over an entire wing of the luxury Cliveden House hotel.There is a white tunnel in place which will be rolled out this morning as Meghan leaves in her dress — ensuring no one sees it before she arrives at St George’s Chapel.Meghan will walk up the Nave of the chapel — the first part of the church — on her own in front of a global TV audience.She will be followed by six bridesmaids and four pageboys including Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three.Meghan will then be joined by Charles through the Quire, which begins in the middle of the Chapel.Buckingham Palace yesterday confirmed the Duke of Edinburgh — who has been recovering from a hip operation — would be attending the wedding.Meghan and Harry have brought a modern touch to their marriage ceremony — fusing the old and the new.Their Order of Service reveals the soul classic Stand By Me by Ben E King will echo around the 15th-century ­chapel, performed by Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir.Harry will also wear a ring. Meghan will not promise to obey her husband and the wording of the service is more contemporary than traditional.The gospel choir will perform Etta James’ uplifting version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine — a favourite in African-American churches — as the newlyweds leave the chapel.The service will also feature English Baroque composer William Boyce’s Symphony No 1 in B Flat.It will use the words from the Marriage Service from Common Worship, printed in 2000, which features modern language, such as “you” rather than “thee” or “thou”.The prince and his former actress bride will pledge themselves to one another “for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part”. In the Declarations part of the service, they will also promise to love, comfort, honour, and protect one another and be faithful to one another for the rest of their lives.The 600-strong congregation will also be asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury: “Will you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?” The guests will then answer: “We will.”Harry’s mum Princess Diana will also be remembered by the hymn Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was sung at her funeral in 1997 and also at William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.Harry and Meghan wanted the family of the prince’s late mother to play a role on the day.Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes will deliver the only reading, from the Song of Solomon, which stresses the strength and power of love.Kensington Palace said the couple had thought carefully about the music, hymns and other parts of the ceremony, while also turning to Charles for help.It said: “Like any couple getting married, Prince Harry and Ms ­Markle have taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service.“This has been a collaborative effort led by Prince Harry and Ms Markle. They have also sought the advice of the Prince of Wales for the orchestral music before the ­Service begins.”Music before the service includes Ralph Vaughan Williams’ Fantasia on Greensleeves and Elgar’s Chanson de Matin.In keeping with royal wedding tradition, the National Anthem will be played at the end.Yesterday started early for Meghan and Harry, with both ­making final wedding-day preparations at their London home of Kensington Palace.Meghan’s dad Thomas is said to be recovering from heart surgery in the US. She said in a statement on Thursday: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, it is not known whether that will be in the wedding chapel or at the Frogmore reception, or both.Sir Elton holds a special place in Harry\u0027s heart as the singer was a close friend of his late mother, Diana, and penned and performed Candle in the Wind for her funeral in 1997.The Rocketman singer also attended William and Kate\u0027s wedding in 2011 and he has rescheduled two concert dates which were meant to be happening this weekend.Keeping with the British theme, there were rumours the Spice Girls may also sing, with Mel B - Scary Spice - apparently letting slip that the band would be performing at the royal wedding.:: Royal wedding 2018: The ultimate guide However, Mel C - Sporty Spice - then said she was \"joking\".Chart toppers Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Stormzy have also thrown their hats in the ring, all expressing interest in playing for the newest royal couple.As Hereford-born Ellie Goulding, a friend of Harry\u0027s, sang at William and Kate\u0027s wedding, it is unlikely she will perform at Saturday\u0027s reception.:: Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars arrive for royal wedding Some veteran acts could also be entertaining the couple and their friends and family.Another question will be what Meghan will be wearing for the reception.Her wedding dress, which is rumoured to have cost \u0026#163100,000 - paid for by herself - is sure to be the star of the show, just as Kate\u0027s was in 2011.Like her future sister-in-law, she is expected to change into something which is a bit easier to dance in for the reception. As an actress on the red carpet she is used to wearing striking, and sometimes revealing, dresses, so she could well choose something similar for the party.Royal weddings have more British traditions than most, but Meghan is sure to bring some American traditions of her own - especially to the reception.They have already bucked the British tradition of a fruit cake by having a lemon and elderflower sponge, and may well have more dainties at the after-party.In America, during the cake-cutting ceremony the newslyweds feed each other the first two slices of the cake - and often stuff the cake into each other\u0027s faces. The first dance in the UK takes place after the cake-cutting, but in America, the couple usually have the first dance immediately after they are announced into the dining room.Meghan is likely to toss her bouquet into a crowd of single female guests, but whether Harry will follow the American tradition of lifting up the bride\u0027s gown to pull off a garter and fling it into a group of his friends, remains to be seen. In the UK, the father of the bride usually gives a speech, but as Thomas Markle cannot attend, her mother, Doria Ragland, may give a speech.Harry and William, as the best man, will both give speeches as is traditional in the UK.However, what is very untraditional in the UK but very American, is the bride giving a speech.With Meghan\u0027s acting background and experience of giving passionate speeches about charitable causes she supports, she is also likely to give an address.She previously said she is not having a matron of honour as she could not pick between her good friends. However, as it is tradition in America for the chief bridesmaid to give a speech, either - or all - of her her best friends, Jessica Mulroney, Lindsay Roth and Misha Nonoo could give a speech."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-harry-meghan-royal-wedding_4314339.jpg?20180519054951 ","title":"royal wedding ceremony revealed the modern touches chosen by harry and meghan","story":"In a nod to her American roots, Stand By Me, by American soul singer Ben E King, will be performed by gospel group The Kingdom Choir.:: LIVE: For all the latest updates on royal wedding dayAs the newlyweds leave St George\u0027s Chapel, the choir will perform Etta James\u0027s version of Amen/This Little Light Of Mine, which is a favourite in African-American churches.:: The lowdown on Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding after-partyWith the Queen being head of the Church of England, the ceremony is still very religious.

And that is why today\u0027s announcement has sparked such outrage.On the one side there are those who think that controlling the scope of betting machines amounts to proof of a nanny state.The Government is meddling, they say, and it will cost jobs and destroy fun. If people want to waste their money on betting machines with a paltry chance at making a profit, so the argument goes, who are we to stop them.On the other side are those who point at the victims of gambling addiction, and who believe that the state\u0027s role is, basically, to stop people doing things that are bad for them, their families and, you might say, for society at large.Now it is hard to say that fixed-odds betting terminals do any social good. Yes, they raise money for the Treasury, and help bolster the profits of some - but not all - betting companies.It may be that some people find them fun, just as some people think fox hunting is fun, but social good? Hardly.The flip side is that it is hard to argue that they don\u0027t do harm - there are many stories of players frantically spending the family savings, of desperate addiction, and of the hapless inadequacy of the existing laws to stop repeat losers.One gambler lost \u0026#16314,000 in seven hours others have been convicted after smashing up shops in desperate fury.The industry will have us believe that these people will all drift to alternative locations - amusement arcades, casinos and shadowy back-street suppliers. The problem, they say, will just be moved elsewhere. What\u0027s more, so we are told, the collapse of these machines will also result in hundreds of shops closing, thousands of job losses, and a huge hit to the Exchequer.And yet sometimes Governments are there to make these sort of judgements.Presumably, somewhere, there are people who were laid off when the local land-mine factory closed.At the end of the First World War, workers were laid off from the factory in Avonmouth where Britain had been making mustard gas. It\u0027s not good enough, frankly, to defend something purely on the grounds that an industry supports jobs.As for the Treasury - that\u0027s a matter for the Government. But within the context of the nation\u0027s tax take, it\u0027s not a big loss, particularly when set off against the plans to impose a different levy on the betting industry.Our giant betting companies are all profitable enterprises, whose future is not dependent upon these machines.

We told how the Prime Minister hoped to “bury the bad news” she was sending another batch of party loyalists to the bloated House of Lords, which is already stuffed with about 800 peers.  And sure enough, at 4.55pm, nine new Conservatives were ennobled in an announcement overshadowed by the run-up to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ’s nuptials tomorrow. The Tory cronies who will take ermine include ex-Social Secretary Peter Lilley and former Cabinet heavyweight Sir Eric Pickles, as we predicted. In total, six former MPs become Conservative peers, as does the party’s former deputy chairman Amanda Sater, and SafeLives charity founder Diana Barran. But former Chancellor George Osborne was snubbed. Ex-MP William McCrea, of the DUP , which props up Mrs May’s minority administration, also becomes a peer. The move came after Mrs May was humiliated by 15 Brexit defeats in the un-elected Chamber, where she does not have a majority. Labour was given three new peerages: former party general secretary Iain McNicol, veteran campaign Martha Osamor, mother of Shadow International Development Secretary Kate Osamor, and author Pauline Bryan. Electoral Reform Society Chief Executive Darren Hughes accused the PM of hiding the announcement “behind the euphoria of a Royal Wedding ”.

A new study has lifted the pastry lid on the pies we most enjoy to tuck into, as well as our opinions regarding the classic pub grub staple. In terms of sweet treats, the apple pie was considered the best of the bunch. And on the savoury scale, steak and ale topped the charts, closely followed by steak and kidney and chicken and mushroom. In fact, the humble steak and kidney pie has been voted more quintessentially British than classic dishes like bangers and mash, bubble and squeak and toad in the hole.  Online casino Casumo commissioned the survey in support of their Play Absurd campaign, which sees comedian Paul Foot attempting to best the world’s fastest pie-scoffers in the Pie Eating World Championships in Wigan.    Greg Tatton-Brown from online casino Casumo , said: “When thinking about a food that Brits all love, a delicious pie is never far from the top.  “Whether savoury like a steak and kidney or sweet with a filling of apple, there are very few people who would turn down a slice of the pastry-wrapped treat. “Our survey found savoury pies are far more popular than sweet, however, which is perhaps due to them most commonly being found at football grounds around the country.” Savoury pies are favoured by 42 per cent of the population, though 44 per cent have no preference whether their pie is sweet or meaty. In order to be considered a pie in its true form the dish must have its filling entirely encased – meaning sides and a lid – in pastry, accord to three in five discerning Brits.  Twenty-seven per cent think a pie isn’t a pie unless it has a meaty filling, and one in six think there must be a rich gravy contained inside the pastry casing. When it comes to the matter of pastry, shortcrust is the variety of choice for 37 per cent of pie enthusiasts. One in four would prefer the light texture of puff pastry, and 10 per cent enjoy a flaky pastry.  The classification of the shepherd’s pie as an official, bona fide pie has long been a controversial decision, and 45 per cent of Brits say the mash-topped treat shouldn’t be considered as such. A further 21 per cent think it should be featured in the pie category, while the remaining 34 per cent couldn’t make a decision one way or the other. It also emerged the average Brit will eat three pies a month, with chips the ultimate side of choice, followed by mash, roast potatoes and mushy peas.  Fifty-four per cent have made a pie at home themselves, and most would rather suffer a burnt crust than a soggy bottom on pulling their creation out of the oven. Brits have also tried some truly bizarre pies in their culinary past, including one bought in Ecuador that contained iguana meat and another containing nettles. Greg Tatton-Brown added: “Pies aren’t just great for eating, they can make for entertainment as well – pie-eating contests take place around the world.

Paul Duffy had been given a court order forcing him to sell the \u0026pound320,000 home in Ratby, Leicestershire, after a lengthy battle.  The blast destroyed the building and shattered a neighbour\u0027s ground floor windows, the Leicester Mercury reports.  Duffy, 57, lapsed the buildings insurance and doused the empty premises in fuel before igniting it, knowing he was due to be evicted any day. People living in two nearby streets were evacuated when the emergency services attended. Duffy, a self-employed window fitter, claimed to have been blown out of the house. He then went into nearby woods intending to kill himself - but changed his mind and returned to the scene to confess.  Duffy admitted committing arson in the early hours of Tuesday April 17. At Leicester Crown Court yesterday Andrew Peet, prosecuting, said the defendant and his ex-partner, Mary Williams, were in a “volatile and unhappy” relationship, which began in 1997 and broke down in 2015. He said: “The defendant can be described as being a bully who exercised a degree of control of his partner, the mother of his two daughters. “The defendant was the legal owner of the house in Church Lane, with the mortgage in his name.” Ms Williams had contributed “significantly” to the deposit and stood to gain in excess of \u0026pound50,000 from the sale, along with having her \u0026pound40,000 legal costs paid from the defendant’s smaller share.  But that was all lost when the property exploded. Mr Peet said the defendant had been a “vexatious litigant” with repeated appeal applications against the sale of the house, after Ms Williams moved out with their children to start a new life. Three petrol cans capable of holding 25 litres, 20 litres and five litres were taken into the property. Fuel was later identified in 27 areas. Mr Peet said: “There was a petrol trail around the ground floor, up the stairs and the loft hatch was left open, no doubt deliberately so it would blow the roof off.”  Mr Peet added: “The explosion left a shell requiring demolition on just a plot of land. “It’s probably worth nil because of the mortgage. “He’s defeated any claim she may have had on the property.” Of Duffy’s mental state, Mr Peet said: “He wasn’t unstable through mental illness, he was perfectly stable, perfectly rational.” Judge Stokes said: “This was a very grave offence. “It wasn’t simply a fire lit in frustration that the fire brigade were able to put out. “It was a carefully planned episode where you wanted to do as much damage as you possibly could.  “Your motivation was revenge against your former partner. “Although you were the legal owner of the property, the (county) court decided she had the majority equitable interest in this property. “You were upset about that and sought permission to appeal.  “That permission was refused and you took it to the Court of Appeal and appropriately, for the same reasons, the judges declined your application for permission to appeal and comments were made that the time had come for you to comply with the order of the court.  “A purchaser had been found and you remained in the property. “You refused to leave it, resulting in an application to the court to have you removed from the property.  “Before the court officers could put that into effect, you chose, in a carefully planned endeavour, to destroy the property. “It wasn’t just a spur-of-the moment offence, borne of frustration, but deliberately and carefully planned. “The object being to destroy the property and impoverishing your ex-partner, who also had the benefit of a \u0026pound40,000 costs award against you. “You allowed the buildings insurance to lapse. “You placed those petrol cans inside the property and caused an ignition. “There was an explosion, you say it caused you to be thrown outside the property. “The house was completely and utterly destroyed, as evidenced by photographs. The judge added: “Given your mitigation, I understand relationships that break down can cause immense emotional strain on individuals.” "},{"url":null,"title":"everyday item clothing kate meghan","story":"NewsEveryday item of clothing Kate and Meghan can\u0027t wear in front of the Queen - even though they love themKate Middleton has been photographed wearing them on several occasions, but she can\u0027t wear them to events the Queen will be at\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseySocial Audience Writer16:40, 18 MAY 2018Updated17:45, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKate Middleton and Meghan Markle have very different styles when it comes to fashion.

Bronte Howard says her massive debt is already more than the mortgage her grandparents took out on their three-bedroom home in the 1970s.  And the amount will continue to rise each year due to interest.  The Wales Online reporter discovered she owes \u0026pound53,409.20 after checking her student loan statement for the first time this week.  She says MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis told her to rip up the statement, saying it\u0027s totally irrelevant and shouldn\u0027t be sent.  But she questions whether it is as simple as that. Below, Bronte writes of her shock and the advice she has been given.   Her words first appeared on Wales Online .   I’m 22 years old and I already have a massive debt hanging over me. It’s more than the mortgage my grandparents took out when they bought their three-bed house back in the 70s. I’m not a frivolous shopper, I don’t have gambling debts and it isn’t from buying property. It’s the price I - and millions of others - have paid to continue studying since tuition fees were first introduced in 1998. For those of you who were lucky enough to be able to borrow from Student Finance Wales (which I believe has a slightly better system where the Welsh Government contributes towards tuition fees, meaning students only pay \u0026pound3,000 a year) or were able to pay the fees without needing to take out loans, I’ll briefly explain how the English system worked when I took out my loans in 2013 and 2016.  I paid \u0026pound9,000 a year to study a bachelor\u0027s degree in English Language and Linguistics at the University of Sheffield. This cost me \u0026pound27,000, which I borrowed. I was also given money in the form of loans (which I have to pay back), grants and bursaries to cover things like rent, food and books. I think in total I had around \u0026pound8,000 a year to spend. Some students studying now are even worse off after the Government scrapped grants and introduced a second loan for students whose parents are on a low income. But after added interest, which started being added to the already hefty bill in April 2017, I currently owe \u0026pound42,711.43 for my undergraduate degree - a lot more than my Welsh friends. I then decided to do a master’s degree in journalism at Cardiff University so I took out a \u0026pound10,000 from Student Finance England and it barely covered my tuition fees. So I actually ended up with overdraft debt and had to rely on my parents (thanks mum and dad) and savings.  At the time, Student Finance Wales didn’t offer a postgraduate loan, so in a way, I was better off than some of my coursemates. (Although now Welsh postgraduate students are entitled to borrow up to \u0026pound13,000). I start to pay this back when I earn \u0026pound25,000 and what I pay is based on how much I earn, not how much I borrowed. But after four years of university, I now have a debt that, unless I win the lottery, I doubt I will ever fully pay back. I didn’t really think about how much I owed and I didn’t know the exact figure until a few days ago when I checked my statement online. I’d almost forgotten that I owed money because it’s almost an invisible debt. I thought it would be somewhere in the region of \u0026pound40,000 because naively, I didn’t really understand interest rates when I took out the loan at 18. It’s actually \u0026pound53,409.20 and will continue to go up each year when interest is added.   The interest rate for my postgraduate loan has also been increased to 6.1%, which is higher than the interest rate for a lot of mortgages and is probably going to go up again. So, after seeing the huge figure I asked finance expert and MoneySavingExpert\u0027s Martin what I should do. After all, it’s a huge amount of money but it doesn’t seem like anybody really cares. He said: \u0027Rip up your statement - it’s totally irrelevant - and shouldn’t be sent. Just consider that you’ll pay 9% extra tax if you earn above \u0026pound25,000. Why on earth would you try and pay it off?” When I eventually start paying the debt, I’ll pay 9% of whatever I earn above \u0026pound25,000 until the bill is paid, or wiped clean.

A white British teenager, dressed in a sari, injured, distressed, her body covered in cuts and bruises. She had been dumped on the Pennine moors in the middle of the night and told to walk home.  Distraught and terrified, she instead made for the Rochdale Crisis Intervention Team’s office to wait for Sara Rowbotham to arrive at work. That was just one harrowing memory from Sara’s 10 years as an NHS sexual health worker in the town where she uncovered evidence of horrific sex abuse being perpetrated against dozens of girls by older Asian men. Her hard work won Sara and her team a Special Recognition honour at the NHS Heroes Awards, brought to you by ITV and the Mirror, which will be screened on Monday.  The Rochdale abuse scandal shone a light on other towns and cities and helped expose other child grooming rings in Telford and Aylesbury. But while Sara is pleased victims are now taken seriously, she says still more needs to be done. She says: “I think every area in the country now has a strategy, a procedure, a dedicated team, so lots of investment has been put into this. Everyone is more aware. “But at the same time I saw a story in the local paper a few months ago where a 12-year-old girl was walking down the street in a state of distress. “Some people came out to make sure she was okay – she was upset because her boyfriend had finished with her. But her boyfriend was 25 and he had groomed her online. So it hasn’t stopped, has it? And the prevention techniques that have been used haven’t stopped that 12-year-old from becoming involved with that perpetrator.”  Tackling the predators should be the main priority, she says. “All they ever talk about is making children and young women resilient to the pressures. They don’t talk about why the hell aren’t we making these men pack it in? “What are we doing to change their attitude and stop their behaviour? Where is the prevention around that? “I don’t think long sentences are deterrent enough. We are still in an environment where predatory men are seeking out children.” For years, Sara and her team banged on the doors of police and social services trying to get help for the girls and action against the men who preyed on them. In 2012, nine men were finally convicted for grooming young girls after an investigation had found more than 40 girls across Rochdale had been targeted and groomed at takeaways in the area.  Some girls were raped by several men, one after another, or taken in taxis to locations across the North of England, plied with drugs and alcohol, and raped. Some of the girls got pregnant. One, aged just 13, had an abortion. Fighting back tears, Sara says: “Those girls had so much potential. What makes me so upset is that I watched them deteriorate because of the terrible abuse they suffered. They could have achieved whatever they wanted, but they didn’t. “Now some of them have substance addictions, severe mental health problems, have had their own children taken into care. What happened to them impacted on their entire futures.” Sara, now 51, had set up the Crisis Intervention Team in 2003, and very quickly realised that Rochdale had a problem with child sexual exploitation. She says: “The first girl who was referred to the team was described as performing sex acts for free to year 10 boys in school hours. “By the time she was about 14 she started to make disclosures about situations she was involved in, like going to parties, taking other girls, getting really drunk, having sex with multiple people at parties, sometimes she would be given money, sometimes she wouldn’t.  “That group of girls got bigger and we were concerned about all of them. “But then, completely separate to that, we met another group of girls who started to say similar names of men. We started to piece things together. It was very rare that a young person would come in and say they had been sexually assaulted or exploited.” The BBC drama, Three Girls, showed how Sara, who was played by Maxine Peake, and her team compiled lists of names, and started to flag up their concerns to police and social services. But their reports fell on deaf ears, as shown in the drama, which also starred Liv Hill, Lisa Riley and Molly Windsor, who won the Leading Actress TV BAFTA last Sunday for her portrayal of one victim. Sara made more than 180 referrals to police and social services, but little or no action was taken. She says: “It just became a case of batting the ball back and forwards. Sometimes social services would do an initial assessment and that was it, sometimes the police would take information for intelligence, but that was it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"james hewitt prince harry rumours","story":"NewsThe truth behind THOSE James Hewitt rumours as they resurface ahead of Prince Harry\u0027s weddingRumours that James Hewitt fathered Prince Harry during his affair with Princess Diana have persisted for decades - here\u0027s what he\u0027s had to say\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRoss Logan20:21, 18 MAY 2018Updated23:42, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWith Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to US actress Meghan Markle dominating the news, the scurrilous rumours about his parentage have surfaced once again.

Pressed over why the rumours have persisted for so long, he said: It sells papers. It\u0027s worse for him [Harry] probably, the poor chap.  Hewitt began a secret affair with Diana in 1986 - which was two years after Harry, now aged 32, was born. Despite this fact, gossip mongers have continued to speculate over who Harry\u0027s father really is, given the resemblance between red-haired Hewitt and the Prince. In 2002, Hewitt told the Sunday Mirror: There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry\u0027s father. I can absolutely assure you that I am not. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine, and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time, I must state once and for all that I\u0027m not Harry\u0027s father. When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.  It is understood Prince Charles also reassured the young Harry that he was his biological father before he started school at Eton in 1998. Supporters of Diana, including her former butler Paul Burrell, have previously spoken out in a bid to quash the rumours. And Diana’s former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, also denied the rumours, writing: “The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly. “The nonsense should be scotched here and now. Harry was born on 15 September, 1984. “Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait.” Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other around the same time Prince Charles was said to have begun an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now his second wife and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Hewitt defended his romance with the Princess, saying he could be forgiven for falling in love with her because it was so easy. Their affair was exposed five years after it started, shortly after Hewitt, a former tank commander, had served in the first Gulf War. Nowadays, the 59-year-old lives as a recluse in Dorset, but said he has no regrets about falling in love with the People\u0027s Princess. No, I don\u0027t regret that, he said last year I regret some of the things that have been caused by that but not that at all. No way.

It was thought Thomas Markle c ould receive his own family coat of arms as a special wedding gift . While Kensington Palace and the College of Arms declined to comment on the present, courtiers said it is a tradition unlikely not to be followed. The fathers of the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie, the Duchess of Wessex, both received the gift when their daughters married into the royal family.  However the decision means Meghan\u0027s relations, who have been outspoken in the lead up to the royal wedding , will not be able to boast their own coat of arms, according to the Daily Mail . A source at the College of Arms told the newspaper: Mr Markle will not have his own coat of arms. We were told it would be too \u0027complicated\u0027.  Instead, the Mail claims Meghan will be given her own coat of arms, following the example of the Duchess of Gloucester, Birgitte van Deurs, who married the Duke of Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen, in 1972. For anyone to be given the distinctive heraldic bearing, they need to prove they have an ancestor who was a subject of the Crown. Mr Markle\u0027s ancestors include Mary Smith, a maid who was recorded in 1856 as working at Windsor Castle, where Meghan will be married in May.  After the family receive their coat of arms, Meghan, 36, and Prince Harry, 33, can get their own “conjugal coat of arms.  They are likely to be officially unveiled a few years after they marry. William and Kate’s made its debut in September 2013, just over two years after their April 2011 wedding.

Kensington Palace revealed last month that hundreds of schoolkids would be invited to tomorrow’s wedding. But there was no reason for all the others to miss out on the party. And as wedding fever swept playgrounds today, one school got into the spirit big-time with a performance by their very own “Harry and Meghan”. Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both 10, played the happy couple in Fleetwood, Lancs.  They arrived at church in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by two residents of a nearby care home, who played Prince Philip and the Queen. The youngsters walked down the aisle before being showered with confetti by flag-waving pals from Flakefleet Primary. The mock wedding was intended to teach the children about being proud to be British.  Thousands of pounds were donated in the form of dresses, crowns, suits, bunting, flags and flowers in an event that captured the heart and imagination of the community. Headteacher Dave McPartlin said the event started as a way of creating memories for the children. But it snowballed after sharing videos of a mini-Meghan and Harry on their first date, on their hen and stag dos on social media. Mr McPartlin said: “It exceeded all of our expectations. It went absolutely to plan and the children had a fantastic time. They made memories that they’ll never forget.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum meet maam how meghan","story":"NewsMum, meet Ma\u0027am: How Meghan Markle\u0027s “free-spirited” yoga teacher mum went from humble beginnings to tea with the QueenMeghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland beamed with happiness as they arrived at luxury Cliveden House Hotel to spend the night before the royal wedding together\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachael Bletchly21:37, 18 MAY 2018Updated22:22, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey swept up the long drive in a royal Range Rover with armed bodyguards following in the car behind. Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland beamed with happiness as they arrived at luxury Cliveden House Hotel to spend the night before the royal wedding together. A relaxed Meghan told fans outside she was feeling “wonderful”. And while the proud mother-of-the bride also looked composed, she must have been pinching herself after three whirlwind days that took her from her modest Los Angeles home to the \u0026shygrandeur of Windsor Castle. Doria, 61, a “free-spirited” yoga teacher and social worker had just had tea with the Queen – her future son-in-law’s granny – and Prince Philip.  On Wednesday she met Charles and Camilla at Clarence House before spending some time with William, Kate and children George, Charlotte and Louis. Tomorrow she will watch her only child Meghan, whom she calls “Flower”, marry a prince and become Her Royal \u0026shyHighness. It’s been a fairy tale ride for the mum and daughter who are so close they call themselves “best friends”. And tonight Doria has her daughter to herself one last time. Wearing a cream dress and black jacket with her dreadlocked hair tied back with a scarf, Doria waved to photographers as Cliveden House managers greeted them. Meghan, wearing a \u0026pound1,350 navy Roland Mouret Barwick dress, told waiting royal fans that she felt “wonderful, thank you”.  The pair were accompanied by a small team of trusted helpers who will prepare the bride for her appearance in front of a global television audience of millions this morning. The pair are staying in a wing of the hotel and a small marquee has been erected over the entrance. Rooms there cost upwards of \u0026pound400 a night. As they arrived at the hotel, it was clear mother and daughter share a unique bond that will survive Meghan’s royal transformation. Harry’s mum had a fragile relationship with her own mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, who walked out on her family when Diana was just eight. But after Meghan’s parents split, when she was six, she grew even closer to her African-American mum, becoming kindred spirits. And their relationship was further strengthened by the vile race hate they faced in 1980s Los Angeles. Doria was born there, to an antique dealer father and a mother who was a nurse.  Her great-great-great grandfather was born into slavery and freed at the end of the Civil War in 1865 when he chose the surname “Wisdom”. Doria went to Fairfax High School, where she was remembered as the bright, friendly teenager with the Afro \u0026shyhairstyle who loved listening to Marvin Gaye and eating at a Mexican taco joint with pals. She began working as a make-up artist in \u0026shyHollywood where she met lighting director Thomas Markle. They wed in 1979 and Meghan was born two years later. The family moved into a house in The Valley, LA. But, talking about her background a year before she met Harry, Meghan revealed Doria was regularly mistaken for the hired help. “The neighbourhood was leafy and affordable,” Meghan said.    “What it was not, however, was diverse. And there was my mom, caramel in complexion with her light-skinned baby in tow, being asked where my mother was since they assumed she was the nanny.” When the couple divorced in 1987 Doria took a job as an air stewardess, meaning Meghan was frequently cared for by her father, whom she clearly still adores. Doria later returned to university and got a masters degree in social work after a BA in psychology. In 2003 the royal bride-to-be got her own degree in theatre and international studies. Doria also fostered Meghan’s social conscience – taking her to visit \u0026shydisadvantaged children in Rwanda, see the slums of Jamaica and experience poverty in Mexico when she was just 10. Harry has already grown close to his fun-loving future mother in law. Last September he flew Doria to Canada to join them at the Invictus Games – where he and Meghan made their love public – and was seen laughing with her at the closing ceremony.  He describes Doria as “amazing” and looks set to hit the dance floor with her at their evening reception. For in a post on her former lifestyle blog The Tig in 2014, Meghan summed up her mum’s personality. “Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free spirit. Lover of potato chips \u0026amp lemon tarts. “If the DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic Call Me, just forget it, she will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance... swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat like she’s been dancing since the womb. “And you will smile. You won’t be able to help it. You will look at her and you will feel joy.” Tomorrow Doria will be the one smiling with joy as she drives to St George’s Chapel, Windsor, in another grand royal car with Meghan. And she will be tapping her foot as a gospel choir sings Ben E King’s hit Stand By Me during the unconventional royal wedding ceremony. Doria will continue to stand by Meghan as she begins her new life. But their special bond means Her Royal Highness will always be “Flower” to her mum.

Instead Meghan will be escorted by the Prince of Wales. I have known Harry since he was born and I imagine he wanted his father to be included. But it is a little strange – and I was confused. Wouldn’t it have been wonderful to see Doria Ragland walk her daughter down the aisle of St George’s Chapel? A show of strong solidarity. After all Queen Victoria escorted two of her daughters.  But I am not surprised it’s not the case. I can almost see courtiers frowning at the thought – because that isn’t protocol, that’s not how it is done. Meghan will have to get used to this grinding of the Royal Protocol Machine. Diana knew only too well you can’t fight them. She would have told Meghan, “You can’t win everything. You have to roll with it.”  But it won’t be Charles walking her down the aisle alone. I expect to see a white rose in tribute to Diana in her bouquet. And so Diana will be right there with Meghan too.

In the same way Prince William and Kate Middleton were given a royal dukedom on their wedding morning, Harry and Meghan have been given a similar honour. Their title means the new form of address for both is Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Queen has also conferred a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel.  As when Kate Middleton got married, Meghan does officially become a princess today - but not in her own right.  She will be HRH Princess Henry of Wales.  An official statement from Kensington Palace read: The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales.  His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms. Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.  The previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace - where the couple are moving to - and he married for love. The situation is slightly further complicated by Meghan using her middle name rather than her first name, Rachel. But just as Duchess Catherine of Cambridge remains Kate Middleton for many of her fans, Meghan\u0027s maiden name is also likely to stick. The royal couple\u0027s marriage was confirmed in an official document signed by the Queen and released last week.

Will she or won\u0027t she? To promise to obey in the vows shows tradition, humility, that a bride will submit to her husband and at no point bother herself with either a dictionary or a lawyer. To omit the word indicates that dread word feminism, the even-more dread word feisty, and also regular rows which, frankly, are in every marriage regardless of who said what. So brace yourselves, tomorrow, to hear Nicholas Witchell\u0027s opinion that was to be expected, Meghan is a very different kind of Royal, but Diana never promised to obey Charles and we all know how THAT ended, don\u0027t we Huw.  It seems like every day we await the Royal wedding is another episode of the Markle Debacle, in which things do not run according to what you\u0027d expect the palace\u0027s plans to be, and therefore a little more like a normal wedding peppered with infighting, drinking and outcast relatives. The latest mismanaged news is that the bride\u0027s father, who was going to walk her down the aisle then decided he was too embarrassing then said he would and then said he was too ill and now appears to be in hospital, is not going to do it after all. Prince Charles is going to do it instead, perhaps because if there is any role he feels comfortable in it is that of an historical anachronism. But for reasons that no-one can quite fathom he\u0027s only going to walk her halfway, with the bride abandoning her mother a the door of the church and doing the first 100 yards on her own and Chuck picking her up halfway, like a last-minute pint of milk. There are three reasons for all the confusion: the Markles all seem to hate each other, the Windsors hate each other as well as everyone else, and Meghan Markle is an independent, feminist, career woman marrying into a family where she cannot be any of those things. Of COURSE the wedding is a mess.  But therein lies any marriage\u0027s biggest risk: change. It\u0027s something that\u0027s inevitable over the course of a lifetime but most of us are resistant when asked to do it in a day. When the change is moving house, a joint bank account, or parenthood it\u0027s bad enough - imagine changing every single thing about yourself, in order to join a family that refuses, under any circumstances, to change. The Meghan we were introduced to after news broke of her romance with Harry was fun. An early starter marriage, some handsome ex-boyfriends, a role in a plot-free legal drama and social media accounts that made her accessible. We saw pictures of her drinking wine, cuddling her dogs, hanging out with celebrity friends in celebrity haunts doing celebrity things. Actual photographs of her with her father, which now seems like the last we\u0027ll ever see of THAT . Meghan the charity campaigner, Meghan the Trump-loather, Meghan who smiled because she had a nice life. And as soon as Harry and her were an item it stopped. Social media accounts were closed, all socialising was done behind closed doors, the acting and endorsements ended and one of her dogs was even abandoned with friends in Canada. She\u0027s had two trips to the supermarket nearest Kensington Palace and soon stopped doing that when she was photographed picking up a loaf of bread. Some change on the part of any Royal in-law is obviously necessary - learning protocol, lowering the hemlines, being camera-ready. But what, exactly, is Harry changing in return?  Well, presumably strip billiards, racist videos and swastika parties are now off the table. But they had been put behind him anyway, so don\u0027t really count. There have been reports he\u0027s started drinking green smoothies and going to the gym, but anyone will tell you that won\u0027t last. And there is nothing else - not one single thing - that will change for Harry as a result of being married. Yes, he\u0027ll get a wife. Maybe children. But the richer, for poorer part of the vows will forever be a private joke, his work-life balance will stay the same and the chances are he\u0027ll still be shooting birds at Sandringham on Boxing Day until, and perhaps even beyond, the point he\u0027s in a wheelchair. Meghan will learn to bow and scrape, to curtsey and hide, speak through others rather than for herself and to not put on a single ounce in weight. Harry will not learn how to deal with her family, as even now they\u0027re almost all being kept locked outside the palace gates. There is no indication he\u0027ll ever meet her father, as news of it would be on a showbiz website before the text message finished its ping. His brother William managed to blend two families together when he married. Granted, the Markles are more likely than the Middletons to steal the spoons and trip over a corgi, but the entire point of marriage is taking the rough with the smooth.  It\u0027s normal to sacrifice things when you marry. Most of us are lucky if we can limit it to sanity. But Meghan seems to have sacrificed almost everything about what and who she is, while her husband has sacrificed... biscuits? The second slice of cake? How every noble of him. Meghan could, and may still be, a modernising and humanising influence on the monarchy. Much will be made of her being able to squeeze Ben E. King and Etta James songs into the wedding music. But all her independence seems, on marriage to the Royals, have been boiled down to two songs off the iPod and some finger food. Of all that we know about Meghan before marriage - AM, if you like - that is all that remains. Meghan post-marriage may still have political opinions but is forbidden from uttering them, will still have relatives but never again speak to most of them, and when we see her smile it will be because she\u0027s on camera, and not necessarily because she\u0027s enjoying herself. Yesterday she drove to her wedding rehearsal in \u0026pound7,000 diamond earrings, and how many of those would it take for YOU to be happy as the junior partner in YOUR marriage?

Gospel group The Kingdom Choir will perform the singer’s Stand By Me, along with Etta James’s version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine. And the couple’s modern spin on a royal wedding also takes in very contemporary vows. Meghan will not promise to “obey” when she marries her prince today at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, and the couple will be pronounced as “husband and wife” rather than “man and wife”. They will also refer to each other as “Harry” and “Meghan” as they say their vows, using the names they are known by rather than their given names – and not including middle or surnames. However, there will still be nods to royal tradition, with classical pieces being played while their 600 guests are taking their seats and a rendition of the national anthem at the end.  And there is a poignant tribute to Harry’s tragic mum Princess Diana with the inclusion of the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer – which was played at her 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included the hymn at their 2011 wedding. A spokesman said Harry and Meghan have “taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service”. He added: “This has been a collaborative effort led by Prince Harry and Ms Markle. They have also sought the advice of the Prince of Wales for the orchestral music before the service begins.” The five organ pieces and seven orchestral pieces that will be played as guests arrive include Ralph Vaughan Williams’s Fantasia on Greensleeves, which William and Kate also chose for their big day.  The orchestra, made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia, will also play pieces by Elgar and Holst. The bride will arrive to a fanfare from the trumpeters of the Household Cavalry then walk down the aisle – where she will be met halfway by Prince Charles – to the sound of Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas singing Handel’s Eternal Source of Light Divine. An order of service to be given to the 600 guests has an introduction taken from Common Worship, which reads: “A wedding is one of life’s great moments, a time of solemn commitment as well as good wishes, feasting and joy.  “Marriage is intended by God to be a creative relationship, as his blessing enables husband and wife to love and support each other in good times and bad, and to share in the care and upbringing of children.” The 20-page service was printed before the couple knew Meghan’s dad Thomas would not be able to attend, so his name is included in the order.   The service they have chosen is from the Marriage Service from Common Worship and features contemporary language – using the word “you” instead of “thee” and “thou”, and offering the most flexibility in the choice of readings and prayers. While the couple are signing the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason will perform three pieces with the orchestra. Recent royal tradition has been for brides not to pledge to obey their husbands. Kate did not in 2011 and neither did Diana in 1981 when she married Charles. But the Queen and her sister Margaret did, as did the Countess of Wessex in 1999. Harry and Meghan wanted Diana’s family to play a role so her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, will deliver a reading from the Song of Solomon, which stresses the strength and power of love. The service will be led by the Right Reverend David Conner, Dean of Windsor, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will officiate as the couple say their vows.  They will also greet the Royal Family as they arrive at the Galilee Porch from 11.25am. Harry and best man William will arrive at 11.40am and greet charity guests outside before entering the chapel as the congregation stands. The Queen is the last to arrive before the bride and will be taken to her seat in the Quire. The chapel was closed to the public yesterday as last-minute preparations were made. London florist Philippa Craddock and her team were decorating the chapel with white roses, foxgloves and Meghan’s favourite peonies, as well as branches of birch, beech and hornbeam. Meanwhile, Windsor town centre was teaming with tourists and fans of the royals waving flags, many preparing to sleep out on the streets to get the best spots for the big day.  Barriers were in place along the procession route with crowds of up to 100,000 expected. Some 5,000 media workers from around the world will broadcast the celebrations to an estimated billion-strong audience. And police were creating a “ring of steel” around Windsor Castle in one of Thames Valley’s biggest operations to date. Armed officers and sniffer dogs have been patrolling the area. Metal barriers have been put up in the Berkshire town to prevent potential attackers from using vehicles, as in the terrorist atrocities committed on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge in the capital.  Police have even asked people not to throw confetti, tweeting: “Please do not throw confetti or any other items at any time during the day, particularly during the procession. “It poses a potential security risk and it’s a bit of a pain to clean up! We hope everyone enjoys the day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding day 2018 live","story":"NewsRoyal Wedding Day 2018: Live updates as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are named Duke and Duchess of Sussex before marriageThe couple are just hours away from the biggest day of their lives and hardcore fans are already out in force to welcome the newlyweds\u0026nbspShareByNatalie EvansJoshua TaylorAssistant news editorUpdated08:28, 19 MAY 2018News\u0026nbspShareVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowThe day has finally arrived when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot.

The 22-page booklet includes details about the processions, music, hymns, prayers and readings which will all be part of the ceremony in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle. A statement from Kensington Palace said the couple had taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service. They added: This has been a collaborative effort led by Prince Harry and Ms. Markle. They have also sought the advice of The Prince of Wales for the orchestral music before the Service begins.    The service is led by The Right Reverend David Conner KCVO, Dean of Windsor. The marriage is solemnised by The Most Reverend and Right \u0026shyHonourable Justin Welby, \u0026shyArchbishop of Canterbury. The service is sung by the choir of St George’s Chapel, conducted by James Vivian, Director of Music, St George’s Chapel. The organ is played by Luke Bond, Assistant Director of Music, St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and Jason Richards, Organ Scholar, St George’s Chapel. The cellist is Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who won the 2016 BBC Young Musician of the Year award. The orchestra is made up of musicians drawn from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia, conducted by Christopher Warren-Green. For the Procession of the Bride, they are joined by Elin Manahan Thomas (Soprano) and David Blackadder (Trumpet), Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir, and the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry. The Order of Service was produced before Thomas Markle Snr, Meghan\u0027s dad, was taken ill. He has since undergone major heart surgery and is unable to attend. Because of that the proceedings may be slightly different than what is written.

The preface The Dean of Windsor reads: “In the presence of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,we have come together to witness the marriage of Henry Charles Albert David and Rachel Meghan, to pray for God’s blessing on them, to share their joy and to celebrate their love. “Marriage is a gift of God in creation through which husband and wife may know the grace of God. It is given that as man and woman grow together in love and trust, they shall be united with one another in heart, body and mind, as Christ is united with his bride, the Church. The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. “It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love. “Marriage is a way of life made holy by God and blessed by the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with those celebrating a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Marriage is a sign of unity and loyalty which all should uphold and honour. It enriches society and strengthens community. “No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God. “Harry and Meghan are now to enter this way of life. They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring. “We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God’s purposes for the whole of their earthly life together. All stand. Hymn: Lord of all Hopefulness Lord of all Hopefulness, Lord of all joy, Whose trust, ever child-like, no cares could destroy, Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray, Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day. Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith, Whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe, Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray, Your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day. Jan Struther (1901–53) ‘Slane’, Traditional Irish Melody Declarations All remain standing as the Archbishop leads the Declarations: “First, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the couple: “The vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the bridegroom: “Harry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?” He answers: “I will.” The Archbishop says to the bride: “Meghan, will you take Harry to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live? She answers: “I will”. The Archbishop says to the congregation: “Will you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?” All answer: “We will”. The collect THE Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he says the Collect: “God our Father, from the beginning you have blessed creation with abundant life. “Pour out your blessings upon Harry and Meghan, that they may be joined in mutual love and companionship, in holiness and commitment to each other. “We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen. All sit. Reading From the Song of Solomon, read by The Lady Jane Fellowes from the Nave. “My beloved speaks and says to me: ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land. “The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom they give forth fragrance. “Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. “Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. “If one offered for love all the wealth of one’s house, it would be utterly scorned.” If Ye Love Me All remain seated while the Choir of St George’s Chapel sing the Motet, If Ye Love Me. IF ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may ‘bide with you forever, e’en the spirit of truth.

Jerry Leiber (1933–2011), Ben E King (1938–2015) and Mike Stroller (b. 1933) arr. by Mark Delisser (b. 1973) When the night has come, And the land is dark, And the moon is the only light we see. No, I won’t be afraid. Oh, I won’t be afraid, Just as long as you stand, stand by me. So darling, darling, stand by me, Oh, stand by me. Oh stand, stand by me. Stand by me. If the sky that we look upon, Should tumble and fall, Or the mountain should crumble to the sea. I won’t cry, I won’t cry. No, I won’t shed a tear. Just as long as you stand, stand by me, Darling, darling, stand by me... Whenever you’re in trouble, Won’t you stand by me, oh stand by me. Oh stand, stand by me. Stand by me.

Amen. Bridegroom places ring on the fourth finger of the Bride’s left hand and, holding it there, says: Meghan, I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage. With my body I honour you, all that I am I give to you, and all that I have I share with you, within the love of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. They loose hands and the Bride places a ring on fourth finger of Bridegroom’s left hand and, holding it there, says: Harry, I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage.

Harry and the Suits actress will tie the knot today at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, surrounded by friends and family. Lucky members of the general public have also been selected to be part of the celebrations, one of the most talked about events of 2018. But who will be part of the royal wedding party? Here are the people who have been chosen to have an important role...  Best man: Prince William  Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his best man at his wedding. William is honoured to have been asked and is looking forward to being by his brother\u0027s side. In a statement last month, Kensington Palace said: Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his Best Man at his wedding to Ms. Meghan Markle . The Duke of Cambridge is honoured to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor on May 19. Prince Harry served as best man to The Duke of Cambridge at his wedding to Miss Catherine Middleton in 2011.  Prince William, who is President of the Football Association, will miss the 2018 FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s special day. Prince Harry was also best man to his brother when Prince William married Kate Middleton back in 2011. The brothers are close and William was always the obvious choice, but it was not officially confirmed until April 26. Strictly speaking, royals have a supporter rather than a best man, but the brothers appear to have broken this tradition.  Father of the bride misses the big day - so father-in-law-to-be Prince Charles steps in Meghan\u0027s dad will not attend the wedding after suffering a heart scare following a row over staged paparazzi photos. Thomas Markle, 73, was initially planning to fly to London from his home near Rosarito, Mexico, to perform the honour at his daughter\u0027s wedding. But the axe fell on this plan, with Meghan announcing: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to than everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.  It was later announced Prince Charles would give Meghan away. She will walk the first part of the aisle with her six bridesmaids and four pageboys before meeting Charles for the rest of the way to the altar. A statement from Kensington Palace read: Ms. Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day. The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms. Markle to The Royal Family in this way.  Mother of the bride: Meghan\u0027s mum - Doria Ragland Feminist Meghan has been keen to involve her mother in the proceedings. She will travel past crowds to the church by car with Doria Ragland , and the bride-to-be is said to be delighted. On Tuesday, the 61-year-old was picked up from her LA home and chauffeur driven to LAX airport, according to TMZ . She flew to Heathrow in London before engaging on a whirlwind of royal engagements. These included meals with Charles and Camilla William, Kate, George and Charlotte and an audience with the Queen at Windsor Castle.  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue as to how she\u0027s stayed looking more like her daughter\u0027s sister. Meghan has previously opened up about her mum, crediting her with being one of the actress\u0027s biggest influences in life. She told Glamour magazine: We can just have so much fun together, and yet, I\u0027ll still find so much solace in her support. That duality coexists the same way it would in a best friend.  Bridesmaids It has been announced that Meghan will not have a maid of honour by her side on the big day. She\u0027s actually decided not to have any of her friends in her wedding party at all, and she\u0027s not having any grown-up bridesmaids. However she will be having children bridesmaids, and Prince Harry\u0027s niece Princess Charlotte will be among them.  Her other bridesmaids are: - Florence van Cutsem , three, who is Prince Harry’s goddaughter, and the daughter of his long-standing family friend Major Nicholas van Cutsem and Alice van Cutsem. - Remi Litt, the six-year-old daughter of Meghan’s close friend Benita Litt and her husband Darren Litt. - Rylan Litt, Meghan’s other goddaughter, seven, and Benita Litt’s oldest child. - Ivy Mulroney, the four-year-old youngest child of Meghan’s stylist and best friend Jessica Mulroney. - Zalie Warren, the youngest of the bridesmaids at just two years old. She is another of Harry’s goddaughters and the daughter of one of his best friends, Jake Warren and Mr Warren’s wife Zoe.  A Kensington Palace spokesman said she simply couldn\u0027t decide which of her friends to pick adding She has a very close knit group of friends and did not want to choose one over the other. There was a lot of speculation about who would take up the royal on Meghan\u0027s big day and lots of names have been thrown around in the last few months. Many believed the honour would go to best pal Lindsay Roth, as Meghan was her maid of honour when she married British accountant Gavin Jordan a few years back.  Page boys Of course Prince George, four, will be a page boy. He will be joined by Jasper Dyer, six, a godson of Harry’s and the son of his trusted mentor Mark Dyer and Mr Dyer’s wife Amanda. Former Welsh Guards office Mr Dyer has been a key father figure to the prince since childhood. Also on the list of page boys are Brian and John Mulroney , the seven-year-old fraternal twin sons of Jessica and Ben Mulroney - and older siblings to Ivy Mulroney.  Prince George and Princess Charlotte Prince George and Princess Charlotte already have one page boy and flower girl gig on their CVs - for their aunt Pippa Middleton on her wedding day last May. George did have a bit of a moment, in tears after the ceremony and with a telling off from mum Kate, but he and his little sister are now set to be page boy and flower girl for Meghan.  Princess Diana\u0027s sister - Lady Jayne Fellowes There is one person Prince Harry will probably be thinking about a lot as he prepares to say his vows - his mum. The royal couple have explained exactly how they will celebrate the memory of the late Princess Diana on their special day. Diana\u0027s sister Lady Jayne Fellowes will give a reading during the ceremony.

And for those of you who won’t be at Harry and Meghan’s big bash, our itinerary takes in every special moment so you can feel as though you are. From early sightings of guests arriving and the first glimpses of the prince and his bride all the way through to their carriage ride as newlyweds, you can follow the day’s strict timetable. While toasting their health and happiness with some bubbly, naturally. 9AM Like Charlie’s arrival at the Chocolate Factory, there will be a frenzy as the lucky recipients of Harry and Meghan’s ‘golden tickets’ begin to gather inside the grounds of the 15th century Windsor Castle for their special ringside seats.  These 1,200 members of the public, specially selected because of their community work, or their triumph over adversity, include representatives of Harry’s charities. They will be joined by 200 schoolchildren as well as 1,240 members of the royal household. Although they are golden invites, they don’t quite get these guests all the way to the promised land. But no doubt they will be dolled up in their wedding finery and happy to witness Harry and Meghan’s big day from outside the Chapel’s walls. 9.30am to 11am It’s an early start for the 600 guests, who will begin to arrive at the castle’s Round Tower at 9.30am – so they will have begun preening at the crack of dawn to look their best for the cameras. Guests, rumoured to include the Beckhams and tennis star Serena Williams, will have first met at the Windsor Farm Shop, founded by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2001, where they will have security checks and show IDs.  They will then be put on coaches to go to St George’s Chapel, where they will enter through the South Door. They have been asked not to bring phones and bulky bags – or carry swords! The guest list is smaller than the 1,900 at Westminster Abbey for William and Kate’s big day in 2011. No doubt Harry and Meghan felt they would enjoy a more intimate occasion. Harry’s good pals Barack and Michelle Obama were not invited. It is thought the awkward etiquette of inviting them and not President Trump was behind the decision.  11.20am The royals begin to arrive, some by foot and others by car – expect Rolls-Royces and Bentleys – and will enter by the Galilee Porch. Stand by to gossip about Beatrice and Eugenie’s fashion choices, especially their headgear.  It is also hoped Prince Philip will be able to attend after his recent hip operation. Protocol decrees the Queen is the last guest to arrive, just before the bride herself. Prince Edward married Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in St George’s Chapel in June 1999. And Harry was christened there in 1984.    11.45AM Brace yourself for whoops and applause as Harry and brother Prince William, his best man, arrive on foot at the chapel’s West Steps, purposefully striding past the hordes invited into the castle grounds. At this stage Harry will have the chance to welcome his charity representatives, gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister at the bottom of the steps.  No doubt his usual cheeky grin will belie a few nerves. William will possibly be relieved not to be centre stage this time round, but perhaps a little nervous about delivering his best man’s speech. Harry memorably called him ‘the dude’ in his own best man’s speech on William and Kate’s big day. Hopefully William returns the compliment. Harry’s long-term pals, ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, will welcome them inside.  11.55AM This is the Queen’s moment to arrive at the castle, just minutes before Meghan. There will be the usual jostle to see Her Majesty.  Always stunning in bright outfits, she is likely to be applauded nearly as loudly as the bride. 11.59AM Expect a roar to raise the castle turrets as Ms Markle arrives at the castle’s West Steps with her bridesmaids and pageboys. She will have already journeyed with her mother Doria Ragland along the historic Long Walk, to the delight of crowds glued to its fringes.  When the car stops at the castle Meghan will be joined by her bridesmaids and pageboys before she enters the chapel via the Galilee Porch. Meghan will be walked down the aisle by Prince Charles after her own father, Thomas, was unable to be there after having heart surgery. The bridesmaids and pageboys will include Prince George and Princess Charlotte, plus Ivy Mulroney, four, the daughter of Meghan’s best friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney. 12-1PM St George’s Chapel will gently descend into quiet as the service finally begins. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple. The Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, will conduct the service.  The sermon is due to be delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, 65, the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church.  The newly married couple will emerge afterwards on the West Steps, before they set off on their carriage procession through Windsor. 1.05PM The newlyweds may conduct a mini-walkabout with charity representatives before their open-top carriage moves past the crowds, waved off by close family on the chapel’s West Steps.  The procession will then travel along Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and Long Walk for 25 minutes, before it returns to the castle where they will join their guests for the lunch reception at 1.30pm.  3.30PM The lunch and speeches at St George’s Hall are set to end, although 200 guests will remain at the castle to relax and refresh before the second, more intimate, reception hosted by Prince Charles at 7pm for close friends and family. The selection of the evening guests has not been without controversy with Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, reportedly upset not to be included. Even Pippa Middleton failed to get an invite, it is said. 7PM The evening reception will be hosted by Prince Charles at Frogmore House in the castle grounds.  You could spot Harry and Meghan leave to travel for dinner.

Newbury, in Berkshire, is home to Vodafone’s headquarters and has a higher ‘digital density’ than anywhere else in the UK, as companies seek to expand beyond London. It topped the list ahead of Reading, Basingstoke and Burnley as smaller towns build up skilled workforces to nurture new startups and tech companies. A new tech report described the ‘productivity power path’ travelling along the M4 corridor and spreading to Southampton and Portsmouth. Gerard Grech, chief executive and co-founder of Tech Nation, which compiled the 2018 report said: “This is the first major milestone of Tech Nation, the organisation now working across the country to build networks that support ambitious entrepreneurs and shine a light on the achievements of our tech sector.  “London is the world’s second most connected hub after Silicon Valley. We need to make the most of that, as our new relationship with the EU will undoubtedly force us to be even more adaptive, innovative and ambitious.” As well as the tech towns, eight cities also showed above-average employment in the technology field, with Portsmouth topping the list. It was followed by Bristol, Cambridge, Southampton and Oxford rounding out the top five. The Tech Nation report shows the UK’s digital tech sector is accelerating faster than the rest of the economy. In fact, the sector’s growth from a \u0026pound170bn industry in 2016 to \u0026pound184bn in the most recent report shows that it’s expanding two-and-a-half times faster than the rest of the UK’s economy. It also revealed the digital tech sector’s workforce is both older, and more ethnically diverse, than the average UK workplace. It showed 72 per cent of UK digital tech workers are over 35, challenging the stereotype that jobs in the sector are usually taken by millennials.

A warning in each bagging area states: CCTV recording in operation for the protection of customers, staff and stock. Similar security measures have already been brought in at hundreds of Sainsbury\u0027s stores across the country in a crackdown on shoplifters using self-service tills. Tesco customers have today slammed the extra security.  Mother-of-five Vicky Morrell, aged 38, from Bentilee, told the Stoke Sentinel : I come to Tesco once a week for bits and bobs.

It seems like something goes wrong with them all the time and that\u0027s quite frustrating. The new CCTV cameras could be dangerous, especially if you are using bank cards and if you have kids as well because you don\u0027t know who is behind the screen watching it. It\u0027s a bit much for me. I can respect the reason for them bringing it in but there are alarms and they could do random checks. I would be much more comfortable with that than seeing yourself on a screen. But if you haven\u0027t done anything wrong you haven\u0027t got anything to hide.

The 51-year-old said he does not blame his half-sister for getting caught up in the Hollywood lifestyle and falling out of touch. In an exclusive interview, Thomas Jnr claims the pair will always be close at heart in a normal extended family that has been pulled in different directions. And he says his father, unable to attend the wedding due to ill health, would be overjoyed Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Ever since it started with Meg dating Prince Harry it has been a media storm nightmare for me and my entire family, Thomas Jnr told . It puts you in a different mind frame and puts a lot of stress, that you don\u0027t even realise, on you. Being photographed and followed, with your private life turned upside down, it\u0027s hard on everybody. So things get done out of frustration and you look back and you know you made a mistake.   Follow our royal wedding countdown live updates here.                The mistake Thomas Jnr refers to is an open letter he wrote to Prince Harry two weeks ago in which he advised the royal to call off his wedding. You feel like an ass about it, the dad-of-two confessed. But my true feelings are that I couldn\u0027t be happier for her. What are the odds. This is every woman\u0027s dream come true - to marry a prince. I couldn\u0027t be more happy for or proud of my sister. She\u0027s incredible. Thomas Jnr, who is in London ahead of the wedding to offer support for his sister, said his fondest memories of Meghan were actually formed during a difficult time for the Markle family. He told how caring and kind she was in the two years that followed their gran Doris\u0027 dementia diagnosis in 2009.  My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two year\u0027s prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time, he said. She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree. It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special. Thomas Jnr also addressed former claims Meghan abandoned her father and forgot about the family when she moved to Canada to play Rachel Zane in legal drama Suits.    When she went to Toronto, and jumped right into that, it was her biggest role, Thomas Jnr said. When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, alway from your family and away from contact. And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart. If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phonecall. We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA. Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family. Thomas Jnr and Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle Snr, had surgery on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack. The retired lighting engineer is reported to be awake and alert but will remain in hospital while he recovers.  This afternoon, Kensington Palace confirmed Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, will walk Meghan to the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor. I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there, Thomas Jnr said. As far as tradition goes, he is he obvious choice. And referring to Meghan\u0027s pre-wedding jitters, Thomas Jnr said she\u0027ll be brave no matter what. The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way, he said. It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it. I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters. Being divorced means nothing, I mean, this is the relationship in her life that counts and matters the most. So, this dress will be outstanding. She\u0027s very confident in everything she does. I think she\u0027s going to be nervous, it\u0027s the biggest day of her life. This is the one that she\u0027ll never forget. She\u0027ll be brave no matter what - she\u0027s got that down.  Thomas Jnr, who this week visited St George\u0027s Chapel and Windsor Castle, is remaining tight-lipped about his plans for the big day. But wherever he ends up, he says he will be celebrating. I wish them all the happiness in the world, he said. When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children. She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time.

All are coping with the devastating psychological impact. And while it was music that brought them together in the worst moment of their lives, on the first anniversary of the atrocity, music is helping them heal. Parents and children who were at the Ariana Grande concert, targeted by bomber Salman Abedi, formed the Manchester Survivors Choir, meeting twice a month in a church near the Arena to sing, talk, laugh and cry together.

It was coming up to Christmas that I realised I needed help. I’m still having counselling now. “But I’ve made friendships at the choir that I know I will have for ever. If you have had a bad week everyone understands and gives you support.” It’s that sentiment which inspired fellow victims Cath Hill, 45, and Carys Crow, 18, to start the choir. They met on a survivors’ WhatsApp group set up by the police after the attack, which killed 22 people and left hundreds more physically or psychologically injured. Cath, from Lancaster, who had taken her 10-year-old son Jake to his first concert, says: “We left from a different exit, so we did not experience seeing people dead or in great distress. But everyone was screaming and we really did think another attack was imminent.”  Weeks later they were caught up in a second terrorist incident in Cambrils in Spain. Cath says: “Jake has had nightmares, shaky legs, worrying about busy spaces. Time has helped, meeting others who were there has all helped. “We are coming together to support each other and using singing as therapy.” The choir, who star on the Manchester City United single by local band Prose, will sing at a memorial event in Man\u0026shy\u0026shychester’s Albert Square on Tuesday. Manchester Together – With One Voice will also feature Parrs Wood High School’s Harmony Group and a mass 30-minute communal singalong.  Choir co-founder Carys, of Otley, near Leeds, was at the Ariana Grande gig with best friend Ella and recalls: “We were waiting to get out when the bomb went off. Somebody shouted there was a gunman so everyone panicked, we ended up under a pile of people. “I’ve struggled a lot with anxiety. Some days you don’t want to get up because the world can seem like such a bad place. “But there are so many good things in the world, too, like the friendships and kindness that came out of it. The choir has been amazing. Now I have the choir I feel a lot safer and understood. I’m at peace.”  As Carys talks, a buffet table is being set up, with cupcakes decorated with the Manchester bee, once symbolic of the city’s industrial heritage but also a symbol of unity since the bombing. Many of the young choristers have had to cope with losing friends. Georgia Faye was at the gig with her best friend Holly but learned the next day that another pal, Georgina Callander, 18, had died in the attack. Georgia, 19, says: “It has been hard. The choir has really helped though. You never have to explain how you’re feeling. Everybody knows already.” Watching the choir rehearse, that spirit of camaraderie is palpable. Natalie Harrison, 15, of Wigan, was at the concert with her mum Melanie but they were in different parts of the Arena when the bomb went off. Melanie recalls her desperate bid to contact Natalie, saying: “I couldn’t even use my phone, my hands were shaking so much.  “There was a surge of people and after about five minutes Natalie just appeared in front of me. I have never been so relieved in my life.” Natalie says: “I get upset because I think about the people who died all the time. When I’m here it helps a lot.” Lorna Turner was there that night with daughter Ava, 11. Lorna, from Wigan, says: “Over the summer it was tough. Ava was having flashbacks. “Here at the choir we don’t always talk about what happened that night but everybody knows how we feel.” As the choir raise their voices once again, there is no doubt that they sing from the heart... “And I’ll Rise Up, high like the waves. I’ll rise up, in spite of the ache. I’ll rise up and I’ll do it a thousand times again for you, for you.”  Manchester City United by Prose, featuring Manchester Survivors Choir, is out now.      Wills to join mourners at service for Arena fallen By Stephen White Britain will fall silent on Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena atrocity. Prince William will be at a service in the city cathedral, along with Theresa May, victims’ families and emergency workers.  In South Shields, South Tyneside, shops and even the town hall will be adorned with pink and blue in tribute to local lovebirds Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19. Their families plan to stay in their home town on Tuesday, saying: “We want to spend the day here where you have all taken our beautiful, perfect Chloe and Liam to your hearts.” Another teenage victim, Nell Jones, 14, from Middlewich, Cheshire, has been remembered with a charity set up in her honour. Her brother Sam, 30, said: “There is evil in the world but there are more good people than bad people.”  Childline reported it had 200 calls from scared and anxious kids after the attack.  Band inspired by shock attack Manchester band Prose were so moved after the attack they wrote the single Manchester City United in just a day. Lead singer Mike Murray said: “At that point there were still a lot of people searching for family members and I feel like the whole city was just in complete shock.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young woman bed bound three","story":"NewsYoung woman bed-bound for three years before dying of disease that some insist is all in the mindMerryn Crofts weighed less than six stone and spent the last three years of her life totally bed-bound with severe ME\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJohn Siddle22:03, 18 MAY 2018Updated07:53, 19 MAY 2018NewsMerryn Crofts had suffered from severe myalgic encephalomyelitis - known as ME (Image: MEN Media)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA devastating disease that some insist is all in the mind led to the death of a young drama student, an inquest today ruled. Merryn Crofts, 21, weighed less than six stone and spent the last three years of her life totally bed-bound with severe ME - an incurable condition that affects 250,000 people in the UK. The youngster was unable to take more than two teaspoons of food before suffering immense gut pain and vomiting, a coroner was told. Merryn, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. today became only the second person in the UK to have ME - myalgic encephalomyelitis - listed on a death certificate. Despite being classed as a real neurological disease, many think the condition is not real - some even within the medical profession. Merryn\u0027s mum, Clare Norton, sobbed as she told Rochdale Coroner\u0027s Court how her beautiful and energetic daughter was left wheelchair-bound and reliant on tube feeding.  She said: As a child, she was a bundle of energy. She didn\u0027t walk anywhere - she would hop, skip and jump. She was the kind of person that people gravitated towards. They wanted to be her friend. She was very social and loved drama. She was a total fashionista, a typical teenager. Her bedroom was a mess of clothes, hairspray and tan. But she was also stubborn and I think that helped her cope with her illness in a lot of ways. She never gave up. In August 2011, Merryn, then 15, was diagnosed with hives and swelling shortly after coming back from a family holiday in Mallorca. Tests in early 2012 revealed that at some point she had contracted glandular fever - a virus which can trigger ME. Despite dozens of medical appointments - including mental health checks for panic attacks - Merryn\u0027s condition deteriorated as she suffered breathing problems, exhaustion and excruciating hypersensitivity to touch, light and sound. She was eventually diagnosed with ME in the summer of 2012. The would-be theatre star, who was forced to wear an eye mask, also suffered from severe migraines, brain fog, slurred speech and persistent infections. Stomach problems, and problems swallowing, meant that her weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half stone.  Coroner Katherine McKenna was told that Merryn could take on just 100 calories a day because her gut was in so much pain, and that, by 2015, even two teaspoons of nutrients were intolerable. Merryn was eventually fitted with an intravenous nutrition line but suffered intestinal failure and was given a terminal diagnosis in 2016.. She died on May 23, 2017, just days after her 21st birthday. Mrs McKenna today concluded her cause of death as starvation caused by a withdrawal of supportive nutriition, caused by ME. She described Merryn as someone who bore her suffering with dignity and good grace. She said: Merryn had suffered with ME since 2012 which caused severe fatigue, gastointestinal failure, chronic pain, global hypersensitivity, loss of mobility and function. Despite extensive investigations no reason for her gastrointestinal failure which led to her reliance on supportive nutriton was found and it most likely it was caused by her ME. Mum Clare, who attended the inquest with daughter Amy Williams and Merryn\u0027s stepdad Dave Norton, told of her long-standing belief that ME contributed to her death. She said: With ME the key symptom is post-exertional malaise. That means if someone\u0027s energy is pushed beyond what they can tolerate, it will trigger all of their symptoms. The best advice we were given was for Merryn to do just 50% of what she felt capable of. But Merryn didn\u0027t even have 50% to give. She was always crashing, so everything that happened to her kept pushing her further behind.  Pathologist Daniel DuPlessis said that a post-mortem showed low-grade inflammation of nerve roots. It was suggested that this inflammation could have made her bowel hypersensitive to processing nutrients. Dr DuPlessis pointed out that Merryn had inflammation of the ganglia - gatekeepers to sensations in the brain. A post-mortem into the only other UK death attributed to ME, Sophia Mirza, 32, in 2006, also found ganglionitis. ME expert at Salford Royal hospital, Dr Annice Mukherjee, said she was convinced that the illness was responsible for triggering Merryn\u0027s intestinal failure. She said: I haven\u0027t come across a case of ME with life-threatening malnutrition before but I have come across many patients with severe ME that are bedbound that have global sensitivity issues and severe gut issues. But every single patient with ME is different, so I never see the same case twice. The ME Association is at the forefront of improving access to care, treatment and research and removing the disease\u0027s stigma. The charity today called for Merryn\u0027s death not to be in vain. A spokesman said: Firstly, the sympathies of the ME Association are with Merryn’s family today. We hope the result of this inquest provides some closure and allows them to cherish their memories of Merryn. It is essential that Merryn\u0027s untimely death is not overlooked and the urgent need for proper recognition of, and research into, ME is recognised. In our present state of knowledge, we don\u0027t know if ME can kill directly, but there are various consequences of having the illness that can increase the risk of early death. What we do know is this: ME is real. It’s devastating. It leaves people, at best, struggling to work. At worst, it leaves them enduring a tortuous existence, a living death, where they are unable to take their place in society.  One in four are so severely affected that they are housebound, bedbound, and in some cases unable to shower, clothe, or feed themselves. People are taking their lives because they cannot bear the torture this illness brings. Others describe themselves as rotting behind closed curtains. Despite being recognised as a neurological disease, many doctors still don’t know how to diagnose and manage ME/CFS and lack or research means that we still don’t have any effective forms of treatment. This is a completely unacceptable situation for a disease costing the UK economy around \u0026pound3.5billion in lost taxes, healthcare and benefit costs. There is no cure - and the longer it will take to find one unless funding dramatically increases. How many more people have to suffer before ME merits properly funded medical research? Merryn, who loved acting, had dreams of attending a performing arts school in Liverpool and adored musical theatre like Billy Elliott and Wicked. Mental health expert, Dr Ross Overshott, told the inquest that Merryn did not suffer a psychological illness, such as depression or an eating disorder. He said: She was hopeful for the future, she could speak in a very involved way about her hobbies and interests, particularly musicals and films. Before she died, Merryn revealed that she wanted her brain and spinal column to be donated to ME research. They were donated to the ME Association\u0027s Ramsay Research Fund, which conducts research into the causes of the disease.

His lifeless body was found hanged in his room on September 17, 2001, alongside a note that read: “Suicide. The unknown man, described as tall and dark, had checked using an assumed name and left few identifying clues.  An envelope stuffed with with $160 (\u0026pound118) of cash was also found with a message indicating the money was “for the room.” Media coverage of his death speculated possible links to the 9/11 hijackers, due in part to his ‘Middle Eastern’ appearance. The unusual cold case has be central to numerous online conspiracy theories for over a decade. Some speculated that the “John Doe” was part of a team of 19 hijackers whose suicide attacks on New York\u0027s Twin Towers claimed the lives of 3,000 people.  Some thought that he could be a spy or a cult member – as DNA traces initially failed to determine his identity. Those theories have now proved to be false thanks to painstaking forensic work by the non-profit DNA Doe Project organisation.  A team of 20 volunteers spent hundreds of hours running his DNA through a genealogy database in the hope they could discover close genetic matches. The team was eventually able to narrow down the location of his family to Almeda County, California.  “In the end, all the DNA matches and all the family trees and all the research paid off. This took persistence, good solid genealogy and detective work”, a Facebook post by the organisation said. Users of Redddit were instrumental in solving the case. 4,000 of their members scoured web groups in the hope that they would be able to trigger the memories of at least one person who could help. It was also those members who first notified DNA Doe Project about Stevik.  Sadly, the real name of Stevik will not be released to the public out of respect to the privacy of his grieving family. His relatives had assumed that he was still alive and had been avoiding them for decades until they were informed of his death. The dead man was also not from a Middle Eastern background but was in fact a mix of Hispanic and native American.

New York lawyer Aaron Schlossberg was filmed making vile racist comments at Spanish-speaking staff and customers in Fresh Kitchen, Midtown Manhattan, on Tuesday.  He threatened to get them ejected from my country in a tantrum that has been seen online nearly six million times. Now people are responding by trolling him by sending taco trucks, pi\u0026ntildeatas and mariachi bands wearing \u0027party accessories\u0027 playing a children\u0027s song to his office. A GoFundMe campaign, set up by Mark Goldberg on Wednesday, has raised $1,094 (\u0026pound812), double its original $500 target, and an update on the page says a band has been booked.  Raising $500 to send a Mariachi band to cheer up the staff and attorneys at The Law Office of Aaron M. Schlossberg Esq. P.L.L.C. after a difficult day, the page says. We are requesting the band to sing the famous, endearing, and warm Spanish children song, La Cucaracha, the cockroach.  We are countering hate and racism with the sound of music.   Any leftover money will be used to send a delicious Taco Truck lunch to the staff and a copy of all federal and state statute mentioning undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare.  A series of later updates confirmed the band has been booked and said the performance will be recorded provided building security does not kick them out.  The date and time of the band\u0027s visit has not been confirmed to maintain the element of surprise. There was extra money, so party accessories and pi\u0026ntildeatas have been bought. In the minute-long clip, the lawyer can be seen practically squaring up to a man in the restaurant while saying: If you intend on running a place in Midtown Manhattan, your staff should be speaking English, not Spanish. My guess is they\u0027re not documented. So my next call is to ICE to get them ejected from my country. If they have the balls to come here and live off my money, I pay for their welfare, I pay for their ability to be there - the least they could do is speak English.

Craig Mitchell, from Yoker, Glasgow, drove down to Carlisle in the North of England to get his hands on his favourite Hawksridge Cider. In Scotland, the beverage jumped from \u0026pound2.15 for a two-litre bottle to \u0026pound5.75 following the introduction of the controversial legislation.  Now, a 50p minimum price per unit is in place. The move has effectively banned cheap deals on booze in Scotland.

Craig spent about \u0026pound100 and saved \u0026pound180 in a purchase he described as a get it up ye to the new pricing in Scotland. It was more of a ‘get it up ye’ to be honest, he said. They can’t take our alcohol off us. I just got over the border and typed ‘Asda’ into my phone. My mate Peter has said not to worry about room to keep it – I can plonk it in his garage. Of course, the savings above don\u0027t factor in the amount Craig spent on fuel. It looks as though he\u0027s got a 4x4, so chances are he spent a good \u0026pound70 on travel. The controversial minimum alcohol pricing policy was introduced in Scotland at the start of this month after a unanimous vote at the Scottish Parliament.

Daredevil Charlie Parker has helped his parents care for the animals at Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria, Australia, since the moment he was able to walk. Charlie, who has his very own pint-sized ranger uniform, held his first snake when he was one and tackled his very first crocodile just two years later. And now, in and around his time at school, Charlie interacts with the animals more than ever – and has big dreams to become a professional zookeeper like one of his idols, Steve Irwin.  Charlie told Barcroft TV: “When I interact with big animals it makes me feel excited. “I like to play with alligators, snakes, lizards and frogs. “When people see me, they’re amazed because I’m so young.” Despite Charlie being nibbled from time to time, he says that he is never scared of interacting with the biggest animals at the park. He said: “I’ve been bitten by a Blue Tongue, a snake, a crocodile, an alligator, a venomous snake that’s called Copperhead and a Black-Headed python.  “I was three when I interacted with my first alligator. It launched at me, launched at me again and then it did a big jump. It was pretty cool. “I’m not afraid of handling snakes or alligators because I’ve worked with them my whole life and I’ve built up a trust to them.” Charlie’s parents, Julia Leonard and Greg Parker, know how comfortable their son is around the animals, but they would never put him in a situation that they thought was risky. Julia, 45, said: “I certainly wouldn’t put him at risk if I thought he was going to get eaten. “Charlie can interact with most animals here at the park – he enjoys working with the penguins, he enjoys working with the mammals and mainly the reptiles.  “He’s very natural around all of them. He’s like a little David Attenborough really. “He really helps out and I think everybody appreciates how good he is with the animals.” With around 50 species of reptiles and 20 species of mammals at the park, Charlie still has his favourite animal – a giant croc called Crunch who weighs around 110 stone. Charlie said: “I like alligators because they launch out of the water. “But my favourite animal is Crunch the crocodile.”  Charlie’s father, Greg, 65, added: “Crunch is a five meter salt-water crocodile that probably weighs around 700 kilos. “Charlie respects Crunch. You know, he’s a big wild-caught crocodile and quite dangerous. “But Charlie is fairly comfortable with him. He goes in there all the time. “We’ve all got bitten fingers and a few scars over the years and Charlie is accruing a few himself. “But here at Ballarat, we believe passionately in conservation and we believe you cannot promote conservation without people meeting the animals up close.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9ad681f7e.jpg ","title":"council rent arrears soar dundee tenants on universal credit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSocial rent arrears run up by Dundee council tenants on Universal Credit have doubled since the start of the year, new figures show.Figures from the city council show that 1,142 UC claimants owe £712,900 to the authority in rent, up from £335,000 at the start of January.Claimants owe an average of £625 each, while other households – including those on “old style” housing benefit – typically owe £404 each.Westminster benefit chiefs have attempted to placate critics of UC by cutting the time new claimants wait for their payments, from six weeks to five.Scottish claimants can also be paid every two weeks instead of monthly.However, critics say this is not enough. Mary Kinninmonth, director of Dundee’s Citizens Advice Bureau, said UC’s online system hampers less computer-literate claimants.She said: “The main things we see are people still having difficulty in making and managing online claims due to lack of confidence and/or knowledge of computer skills.“The helpline is also very difficult to get through to with long waiting times.“Even though the waiting time has reduced, there is still a waiting time – which will often mean people going into rent arrears.”Full service UC rolled out in Dundee in November, following a trial period for new single applicants.The number of Universal Credit issues dealt with by Dundee CAB has risen by almost 50% following the introduction of the full service.Dundee City Council gives UC claimants a reprieve over their arrears, acknowledging the delayed payouts the DWP makes from month to month.A spokesman for the authority said a £250,000 hardship fund for council tenants was created in April 2016, boosted to £450,000 for this year.He added: “We continue to do a considerable amount work to support tenants on Universal Credit.“If a tenant is having difficulties paying their rent a referral to the Council Advice Service is made.

They had used an orange survival bag over an old duvet, sticking their head in under the old fireplace for cover and placing their feet in a thermal shopping bag for warmth.”Gareth said that on Wednesday night the charity helped two women who needed medical attention.He added: “Our outreach patrol was kept busy that evening as we gave out lots of hot chocolate drinks, made two new street friends, issued two sleeping bags, cleansed and dressed one girl’s self-harming wounds on both her lower arms and transported another female street beggar to A\u0026ampE.”On May 12 Gareth said the team gave hot drinks to two homeless people who were sheltering in a church foyer.Five days earlier he helped a 47-year-old Jamaican man sleeping on a bench in Riverside Drive who was heading north.“We were able to supply him with a sleeping bag, hot drinks and advice and directed him to more suitable sheltered location,” he said.Gareth said that, the day before, he had spoken with three rough sleepers who told him they had been refused assistance from the authorities.Mike Cordiner, of the Eagles Wings Trust, said: “There seems to be a rise in the number of people coming to Dundee from other areas. I am aware of someone from Jamaica and a person from Poland currently sleeping rough in Dundee.“If you come from outwith the city the authorities do not find you somewhere to sleep.“This needs to change.”A council spokeswoman said: “We understand that being homeless is difficult and traumatic and our aim is to offer a service that is sympathetic as well as meeting our statutory duties.“When we

The police are never out of there,” she said.“Why are they creating a new community campus and putting this right smack bang in the middle?‘‘It’s disgraceful.”Tom Henney, who drew up a petition against the custody unit, said he wasn’t opposed to the SPS proposals.‘‘My opinion is still the same – nobody has any objection to what they’re trying to do but there are other areas better suited for this,” he said.“My biggest concern is if (offenders) get out.‘‘There are drugs, there is crime and it shouldn’t be here.”However, Ann Hutchison, 57, who lives two minutes from Our Lady’s, said she was “keeping an open mind” on the plans.She added: “I’m glad the prison service are out speaking to the community. They should be.”Councillors were also in attendance at the information session, but couldn’t comment directly on the proposals as they are yet to come through the planning system.The SPS’s Tom Fox said it was inevitable that locals were concerned, but added: “Most of these are based on ideas of something that this unit isn’t.‘‘It is not a prison.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9ae43941b-846x564.jpg ","title":"thousands across dundee celebrate ramadan and locals invited to join evening meal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of Muslims in Dundee have started celebrating the holy month of Ramadan – and locals are being invited to take part to find out more about the festival.Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.Bashir Chohan, head of Dundee Islamic Society, said that as of Thursday, Muslims from 13 nationalities across the city were observing the event.Mr Chohan said: “It is an important event in the Muslim calendar and involves a period of fasting for the next 30 days.“We fast from dawn until dusk when we are allowed to begin eating again.“I have my first meal of the day at 9.30pm when we usually begin eating with a selection of snacks.“We eat all sorts of food at this time from east and west and often begin with a cold drink or a milkshake.”Mr Chohan explained that fasting was for adults with children beginning to take part from the age of about 10-12.He said: “It is up to children and their families to decide when the children can cope with fasting.”Mr Choham said that at night, following the breaking of the fast, Muslims would be going along to the five mosques in the city to pray.“We listen to the Imam reciting from the Koran for an hour and we say special prayers,” he said.“And while at the mosque we serve around 300 to 400 meals a night to visitors.”During Ramadam, Mr Chohan said that Muslims were also expected to be on their best behaviour at all times.“Of course we should always be on our best behaviour but it is particularly important during Ramadan,” he said.“Ramadan is a very spiritual time for us. It is a peaceful time and an opportunity to repair body and soul.“We eat for the rest of the year and it is an order from God to obey his rules and take part in fasting and prayer during Ramadan.”Mr Chohan said that, as always, he would welcome Dundee residents to visit the mosques during Ramadan.He said: “Anyone is welcome to visit our mosques and take part in what is happening during the month.“We would be delighted for people to come along and see what we do and take part if they so wish.“Women as well as men are very welcome to attend. We are happy to share our religious beliefs and traditions with everyone in Dundee.”Ramadan began this year on May 15 and will end on Thursday June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past  Looking back at life Doon the Watter","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic fans rush to buy new    Only the Bold    home kit ahead of Scottish Cup final","story":"                          CELTIC\u0026rsquoS new 2018/19 home kit has hit stores -

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
