Can you see it?”Of course I can’t see it. My head is filled with all things apple the central concept connects with myriad associated topics: orchards, trees, red apples, rotting apples, cider, blossom, an endless web that spreads along more and more tenuous connections. But of course I can’t see it. I usually say yes, though, because I assume it’s a figure of speech.Then a year ago, I read an article online about aphantasia and all at once I understood that pretty much everyone visualised their thoughts all the time!That was a shock. I understood the concept. Like the large majority of aphantasics I see pictures when I dream. (Dreaming comes from a different part of the mind.) But it sounded like great fun to be able to summon moving images to the mind. I felt suddenly robbed, as if I had missed out on some universal treat. And that’s how the language frames it – you “suffer” from aphantasia. A swift Googling gives us this description: “Aphantasia is neurological defect that affects the brain without any serious health risks.” A defect. Well … damn.People I tell are amazed. They want to know how I even function, how I imagine anything. There’s a distinct vibe of pity. I have a severely disabled daughter, so I in no way want to overplay this card – I know what disability is – but, in some sense, I felt momentarily that I was disabled, that I lacked a significant ability that I should have had.I’ve discovered since that there are people who don’t hear an inner voice. At this point I shared the incredulity others experience regarding aphantasia. It’s hard for me to imagine life without an internal voice. I also discovered that some people have other internal senses, such being able to smell, touch and taste in their minds. I can’t do those things either.I don’t have a problem with imagination. I write books that are often praised for clear and evocative visual description. I’m asked by people if I’ve climbed rock faces, fought with swords or even had cancer, because my descriptions of these experiences have convinced people who have actually lived them that I must have, too. (I haven’t.)It’s very hard to know if aphantasia has an impact on my writing. I tend to avoid lengthy visual description, but I feel that’s a matter of taste. I’m currently going over a forthcoming book with my editor, who uses the “praise sandwich” to feed criticism past the author’s ego. So she takes the time to compliment lines she admires, such as this one:Wings rose above the holothaur’s back, a black suggestion of flight, reaching to the vaulted ceiling to merge with the shadows there.Now this is a wraithlike creature, so harping on about veined leathery wings or midnight feathers or whatever wouldn’t be appropriate. But I guess I do tend to stretch the language in a manner that brushes against poetry, such as in “a black suggestion of flight”, which focuses on a feeling, rather than specific physical details.These days, I reject the description of aphantasia as a defect. I see it as an alternative. You see a horse if asked to imagine one. I find this rather limiting. I imagine a web of horse-stuff that leads me down many paths. The idea of seeing one particular horse actually lacks appeal. What if it’s not the horse I want? What if I want something larger, more fundamental than an image? From the outside all we see are results the interior workings are hidden. The idea that the qualitative experience behind each inidual’s existence can be so different is a new and fascinating one. I suspect that we have much to learn about quite how unique each of us is in the handcrafted virtual reality we all maintain behind our eyes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/babe79acbe024da1f08b193eac6856f7f094d1e1/0_13_1791_1074/master/1791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d206e14b3b1ced04710fb4c9bdd523b8","title":"my meteorite by harry dodge review reflections on touch and vulnerability","story":"The American artist has written a compelling memoir and meditation on human interaction relevant in the coronavirus era﻿What do we expose ourselves to when we touch another person? How vulnerable are we when we make our bodies porous or penetrable to others? When he wrote My Meteorite, Harry Dodge wasn’t to know how fraught these questions would be by the time it was published, or how contentious his pleas for a tactile, mutually contaminating community might become. “To wit, we’ve been on the move – mixing with each other and things – forever,” he says, assuming this is an ongoing state. It has turned out to be more complex.To the literary world, Harry Dodge is best known as the partner of Maggie Nelson. In her groundbreaking memoir The Argonauts, Nelson gives memorably powerful descriptions of Harry arguing about the limits of language, having gender reallocation surgery (when they met he was biologically female), enduring the process of his mother’s death and having a lot of sex with Nelson. There, Dodge was presented as the one who mistrusted words, who yearned for invisibility only to be brought into lambent visibility by Nelson. In fact, though, Dodge has all along been making himself visible through his art: playfully corporeal sculptures and cryptic, experimental films.Now he tries out a new form of visibility, following Nelson in writing a hybrid work of memoir and theory. He writes here about his parents dying, about reconnecting with his birth mother, about his abiding interests in consciousness, memory and artificial intelligence, and about ordering a meteorite by post. Along the way there are diaristic digressions that show him parenting his two sons, having sex with Nelson and other lovers, and collaborating with a series of contemporary artists.Dodge takes his cue from high French theory of the 1970s and 80s, seeing what it looks like under the changing pressures of new historical surroundings and new versions of family. He shares Nelson’s love for the evocative phase “human animal”, and threading through the book are questions about what makes us human: what makes us different from a machine. He’s interested in robots, and in our capacity to invent machines that can destroy us. In his 2019 video Late Heavy Bombardment he showed a group of very human robots engaged in a seminar on how to injure human beings. The robots tell themselves here that they are unwilling to cause harm, but need nonetheless to defend themselves.Dodge highlights the sleek impervious danger of machines partly to remind us of the vulnerability of the human animal. There’s a lot on death and sex in this book, because he seeks clues in these acts as to what makes us human. Penetration for both of them involves smashing into orifices greedily and violently, partly by way of revealing how strange it is for us to enter the body of another. Sex also reveals, for Dodge, how crucial the body’s “de-evolution into unreason” is to human life: how unreason is as human a state as rationality. Death, like sex, reveals our materiality, showing our bodies to be merely matter that can be touched, mangled, destroyed.These are fascinating thoughts, and there are questions to make us think again on every page. He also has a gift for storytelling, however sparingly used, and the scene where he speaks on the phone with his birth mother is particularly moving. Sometimes the connections between ideas and scenes feel a little tenuous, especially when we’re jumping between very short sections. But throughout there’s a feeling of a singular intelligence, driven by a set of related questions about the relationship between matter and spirit, or empiricism and the occult.I found his thoughts on climate change particularly compelling, partly because he diagnoses his own “ultra-misanthropic, radical primitivist mind-set” as responsible for his earlier belief that humans “are a scourge on the otherwise flawless, paradisiacal surface of the earth”. This is a view that is all too prevalent today, and Dodge’s realisation that it’s incompatible with his sense that humans are “not excepted from but – continuous with nature” is a helpful one.It’s thoughts like these, together with his ideas on touch, that make me want to know what Dodge thinks, in the new age of corona in which we find ourselves. His book is salutary now, partly because he shows us that processes of human connection have always been fraught. When he vows to himself “to leave the studio sometimes – risk contact with unfamiliar humans – in order to find myself in the heaving maw, the protean, flowing haemorrhage of universal energy” he reminds us that we have always feared contamination by other bodies and other minds, while pushing ourselves to risk it. Where, then, can the human animal seek its energy in this era of lockdowns and social distancing? Dodge may help us to find out.• My Meteorite: Or, Without the Random There Can Be No New Thing by Harry Dodge is published by Vintage (£14.99)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f19c4b0f69825ee6ba82ff4ea3eee2c149ca5/0_164_5025_3014/master/5025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd56b2145cac24803d22028853724008","title":"british american tobacco plant based coronavirus vaccine","story":"Cigarette maker says tobacco plants offer potential for faster and safer drug developmentBritish American Tobacco, the maker of brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Rothmans and Benson \u0026amp Hedges, has said it has a potential coronavirus vaccine in development using tobacco plants.BAT has turned the vast resources usually focused on creating products that pose health risks to millions of smokers worldwide to battling the global pandemic.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

Dr David O’Reilly, the director of scientific research at BAT, said: “Vaccine development is challenging and complex work but we believe we have made a significant breakthrough with our tobacco plant technology platform, and we stand ready to work with governments and all stakeholders to help win the war against Covid-19.“KBP has been exploring alternative uses of the tobacco plant for some time. One such alternative use is the development of plant-based vaccines.”BAT said it had cloned a portion of the genetic sequence of the coronavirus and developed a potential antigen. The antigen was then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction and, once the plants were harvested, the antigen was purified. It is now undergoing pre-clinical testing.The tobacco firm is more typically on the receiving end of criticism from campaigning groups, including the use young and attractive models to entice younger demographics to try e-cigarettes and vaping technology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0b15be7aa98927a12bdf52f35c16466a37eb57/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcaaef91784ff247ab9f5e641e4a3152","title":"lengthy lockdown unrealistic says former bank of england governor","story":"Offer self-employed swifter help, Mervyn King says, and consider sending people recovered from Covid-19 back to workLord Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England at the time of the 2008 global financial crisis, has warned that an indefinite Covid-19 lockdown is unrealistic and ministers need to work on an exit strategy.King said he understood the reasons for quarantining most of the population, but that there would be a backlash if the restrictions were kept in place for too long.Speaking at a webinar organised by the thinktank Policy Exchange, King said: “The idea that you can have a lockdown that goes on for months on end is unrealistic. The government needs an exit strategy, which may be gradual and initially involve those who have had the virus and are able to travel and go back to work. If we have a lockdown for too long there will be a rebellion against it.”King said it was pointless to speculate on the extent of the health and economic damage caused by the crisis, but emphasised that there would be significant costs in terms of failed businesses, lost jobs and increased unhappiness.“It is understandable that health officials focus on the broad-brush aspect of this – the need for a lockdown to diminish the spread of the virus”, he said.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.But the former Bank governor said it was also important to think about the mental health of people being made unemployed, or whose businesses were going bust.“There are people struggling to get out to buy food and who are stuck on their own. Young people are having their university education and school exams cancelled, and that it is going to have a significant impact of their wellbeing and future careers.”King added the government had made a deliberate decision to lock down the economy and so had a responsibility to ensure cash flow to businesses big and small, and to act as the customer of last resort.The Treasury needed to speed up its plan to offer financial help to the self-employed because the target date of early June would be too late for many, he said.Alistair Darling, the chancellor responsible for bailing out stricken banks at the beginning of the 2008 crisis, said the government was failing to provide a consistent message on testing for Covid-19.“It is critical in any crisis that the message has clarity”, Darling said. “At the moment we don’t know whether the government is going beyond NHS staff to the public as a whole. Unless we know who has got it or who has had it, we are always going to be on the back foot.”Darling also said that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make sure measures were having an impact where they were needed.“It is very easy to announce a policy, but much more difficult to get it delivered. The economic measures are absolutely vital, but for the self-employed delivery is going to take longer than people have got in many cases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92be4c664861b78ea53043b714833e991d98314d/181_413_2934_1761/master/2934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb662d803d17c881ba43c0050553a3f7","title":"markets covid 19 recession factories uk banks cancel dividends coronavirus business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as stocks begin the new quarter with fresh lossesBrazil’s factories have suffered a slump in output last month, with falling orders triggering a jump in job cuts:Many commodity prices are down today, as traders anticipate less demand for copper, iron and platinum as the world economy stumbles:The oil price war has claimed its first US shale producer: Whiting Petroleum.The latest US jobs report is out.... and fails to give a true picture of the economic cost of Covid-19.The monthly payroll report from ADP shows that US companies cut their workforce by 27,000 last month.

That will help them through the Covid-19 crisis, but such a debt pile will hurt their credit worthiness in future.Those on the other side have an immediate problem - no access to loans or debt issuance.“For them, a liquidity problem will become a solvency issue,” says El-Erian. This means a reversible shock will become a permanent capital impairment shockThe markets are still working through this issue, he adds, but the upshot is “lower valuations from here”.Time for a market recap..... and European stock markets are still down sharply.Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and has already apologised for the way it began its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, is trying to make further amends by committing to restrict the salaries of its top executives to a maximum of £40,000.It has also pledged to pay “virtually” all its “direct retail and head office staff their salaries until at least the end of April 2020”.In an email to staff sent on Tuesday, the company’s boss Mike Ashley said that by making the pledge it has guaranteed March and April salaries for over 20,000 iniduals, during which time the group’s shops are likely to remain closed.He added:“As part of this, our senior management team have taken voluntary pay reductions to ensure the group has the best chance of continuity.Each inidual has reduced their basic pay to a maximum of £40,000 a year, taking effect from May onwards. This is a tremendous first step and show of support towards securing the future of the Frasers Group.”Ashley is not paid a salary by the group, which he founded (and is still majority shareholder).While the news will be welcomed by the company’s shop and office workers, the email made no reference to plans for the thousands of agency staff that work in the group’s giant Derbyshire warehouse in Shirebrook.The facility remains open to fulfill online orders and the company has suggested it has been struggling to enforce coronavirus safety rules inside the depot, where some workers say they feel pressured into turning up for work.The union Unite has called for Shirebrook workers to be sent home on full pay, while the TUC has called today for the government to publish tough new rules about safety for businesses that are staying open – and to close them down if they won’t comply.Last week Ashley issued a public apology following a spat with the government about trying to keep his Sports Direct chain open when non-essential businesses were ordered to close, arguing that selling sporting and fitness equipment made the company a vital asset as Britons were forced to stay at home.He reversed the decision and said: “I am deeply apologetic about the misunderstandings of the last few days. Given what has taken place over the last few days, I thought it was necessary to address and apologise for much of what has been reported across various media outlets regarding my personal actions and those of the Frasers Group business.”Incidentally, the big fall in employment at UK factories last month does not seem to include workers who have been temporarily furloughed:The most surprising story of the morning is that British American Tobacco is, it says, working on a potential vaccine for COVID-19 using proteins extracted from tobacco leaves. In happier times, this could have been an April Fool’s joke (we’ve seen worse over the years). But BAT insist that it’s true.Tobacco giant BAT, maker of brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Rothmans and Benson \u0026amp Hedges, has said it has a potential coronavirus vaccine in development.The company said that its US bio-tech subsidiary is in pre-clinical testing using “new, fast-growing tobacco plant technology”.BAT is hopeful that, with the right partners and support from government agencies, between 1 and 3 million doses of the vaccine could be manufactured per week, beginning in June,” the company said.BAT, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said that its work on coronavirus is being carried out on a not-for-profit basis. BAT’s plan is to use a cloned portion of COVID-19’s genetic sequence to create an antigen that is then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction.Once harvested, the antigens are extracted and purified and inserted into the body. This prompts the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the antigen. Those antibodies would also fight the Covid-19 pathogen, giving resistance to the virus.Whether BAT’s biotech experts will actually deliver a breakthrough is another matter. Many other companies are close to human trials of potential vaccines... but that process can take months, as ineffective or downright dangerous options are weeded out.Some vaccinologists believe it could take 18 months for a Covid-19 vaccine to be fully developed, properly tested and approved for human use.Still, given the urgent need for a vaccine, let’s hope BAT are onto something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78f5abd62bf3ddc7c3df5798600c95ca0ece864d/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306f3cdfe8005dc5d610c00a13cc4ac3","title":"amazon coronavirus new york chris smalls dismissed","story":"The company dismissed a worker who had been protesting conditions – someone who dared to raise the consciousnesses of those around himOn Monday, Amazon fired a warehouse worker who had been protesting about conditions at a New York City facility during the coronavirus outbreak. Chris Smalls, an assistant manager and organizer, had led a walkout demanding Amazon temporarily shut the facility for cleaning after multiple workers tested positive for Covid-19.It was a move that spoke to the inherent inhumanity of the trillion-dollar corporation, one that will need to be brought to heel by a future presidential administration. The workers were seeking hazard pay and more protective gear as they labored during the pandemic. This, along with Smalls’ willingness to challenge the company, was apparently too much to take.Amazon claimed Smalls was dismissed because he had close contact with a worker diagnosed with Covid-19 but refused to stay home for 14 days. According to the company’s previous statements, the infected co-worker in question last reported for work on 11 March. Had Smalls been exposed that day, a 14-day mandatory quarantine would have made him eligible to return as soon as 25 March. Smalls, however, claimed Amazon did not send him home until 28 March, three weeks after the exposure.Smalls is rightfully considering legal action and the New York state attorney general’s office is calling on the National Labor Relations Board to investigate. It’s likely Smalls was dismissed because he was a worker who dared to raise the consciousnesses of those around him. For a corporation as virulently anti-union as Amazon, workers like Smalls are particularly dangerous: they are the future leaders of a labor movement.Amazon, perhaps the most successful corporation on Earth, can more than afford to turn a profit and treat their warehouse workers with dignity. Jeff Bezos will remain a billionaire if he chooses to pay every worker a middle-class salary with healthcare benefits and a pension. But doing so would require a slight reduction of his world-historical wealth and be a violation of the iron law of greed: more is always better.There is no greater illustration of the moral decay of 21st-century corporate America than Amazon. Past behemoths trafficked in noblesse oblige, tolerating unions and even investing in their workforce. Automobile plants and steel mills accepted that the price of doing business was guaranteeing their workers more than a subsistence wage.Amazon, which employs a well-compensated white-collar workforce and a vast range of warehouse workers who labor in punishing conditions to get products shipped all across the world, is not interested in the social contract. Rather than collaborate with their New York warehouse workers to safeguard their health amid the worst pandemic in a century – more American lives have been lost than on 911 and hundreds of thousands more could die – Amazon would rather leave an employee without a job at the worst possible moment.The firing sends a clear message: come against us and you will be crushed. It’s raw authoritarian logic, instilling fear to smother all dissent. If Amazon merely eviscerated brick-and-mortar stores across America, triggering massive job losses, it would be an unfortunate company. But kneecapping the competition was never enough for Bezos. He needs to pit the nation’s cities against each other in a race to the bottom for extraordinary tax breaks, depriving them of revenue they could use to fund schools and public infrastructure. He needs to erect draconian warehouses where workers are forced to pee in bottles and pop pain medication to cope with prison-like conditions.The coronavirus outbreak has laid bare the absurdity of predatory capitalism. An America without guaranteed sick leave and universal healthcare is particularly ill-equipped to protect its inhabitants during a pandemic. Into this void steps Amazon, a corporation that cares even less about the fates of those who serve it. It is, ultimately, an all-American company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fb69ef4ba2701bde80f4f81d0ba2864fefbd26/0_251_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac62ffe7641ea706d3cee70fe37b4da","title":"doctors choose life saving treatment ethical rules","story":"Robust ethical rules on coronavirus are vital to guide us to the right decision, however agonisingThe headlines are stark: a “tsunami” of Covid-19 patients moving inexorably toward London’s hospitals and then spreading out across the rest of the UK. Despite heroic efforts to increase supply – and reduce demand – there may come a point when this tsunami will simply overwhelm intensive-care beds, ventilators and life-support machines. Although we hope this will not be happen, it is important we begin to think now about how we would respond should that situation arise. As in Spain and Italy, heart-wrenching decisions may need to be made, agonising choices about who gets access to life-saving interventions. Should there be a disjunction between need and resource, these decisions will become unavoidable. The question is how do we ensure decisions made are ethical?Over recent weeks, we at the British Medical Association have worked with leading medical figures to put together guidelines to ensure just this. This guidance is clear, authoritative, ethically robust, and developed with a broad range of input and opinion designed to support doctors as they approach these most trying of decisions.Sadly, these guidelines do not preclude the necessity to make enormously challenging ethical decisions. Guidance can indicate how to proceed. It cannot stop the choices being brutal or relieve decision-makers of their moral distress.Looking ahead to the coming weeks, if hard choices are required, we know they will be contested. There will be anger and pain. People who, in normal circumstances, would receive intensive treatment may instead be given palliation – pain relief without a cure - in order to favour those with greater likelihood of benefiting. Nobody wants to take these decisions, but if resources are overwhelmed, they will have to be made.In taking them, we need to begin with justice or fairness. If everyone matters equally, but we cannot treat all of those in need, what does a fair allocation of resources look like? In times of plenty, fairness means allocating resources according to medical need. The greater the demand, the greater the resources provided – as long as the patient will benefit. Even before Covid-19, the NHS was not amply equipped. Resources were being rationed by way of waiting lists and brevity of consultation. But – generally – the more ill you were, the greater a priority you were.For a time, Covid-19 may overturn this approach. The question will no longer be how best to meet inidual need, but how to maximise benefits from severely stretched resources. To the criterion of medical need, must also be added the patient’s likelihood of benefiting. It is preferable to save the lives of three patients with high need and a high likelihood of benefiting than one patient with high need and a low – but nonetheless real – chance of benefiting. The principle that everyone matters is in tension with the requirement to maximise overall benefit. This is the heart of the moral challenge.The BMA’s guidance addresses the ethical aspects of these difficult decisions. It is designed to support doctors. But, at this time, there will undoubtedly be challenges. Objective clinical standards can be indirectly discriminatory. We know that the presence of comorbidities – having more than one illness or condition – or underlying frailty is associated with higher risks for patients with Covid-19. An approach based solely on clinically relevant factors may, statistically, prioritise the younger and, where clinically relevant, it may discriminate against those with underlying health conditions. We need to be alert to this. We need to keep practice under regular review and modify it as more evidence and feedback become available. Neither age nor disability in themselves will be criteria – only where they impact on a patient’s capacity to benefit.And what if there are more patients with capacity to benefit than life-saving resources available? There are two options, neither of them ideal. More likely is a modified queueing system based on the widely accepted principle “first come, first served”. Patients who become critically ill earlier will be more likely to be admitted to intensive care or receive mechanical ventilation than those who become similarly ill later on, even though they may be offered intensive support for a defined but limited period. While such an approach is procedurally simple, and arguably fair, it is not without its challenges. It gives priority to those who are mobile, who have access to transport or who live close to hospitals. The alternative is some form of lottery, but pity those who would have to manage it.These are unprecedented times. Our health system – like our society itself – is facing its gravest challenge since the second world war. Given the vital importance of these decisions – and the inevitability of dissent – there must be a national debate now, in advance of these decisions having to be taken. Public acceptance requires an understanding of why these decisions must be made, and the rationale for the way in which they are made. I write in the hope of contributing to that debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0188aad78e4e216b932a687ee9fb01623935e74/0_72_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d77d36df4ac97c5c2525afcc86d4f98","title":"populist right coronavirus","story":"Science and welfare are at the heart of this crisis – which is bad for right-wing populists. But they won’t be wrongfooted for longThe populist right has built their electoral strength on boisterousness and arrogant self-confidence. Yet, amid the coronavirus pandemic, figures such as Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and Jair Bolsonaro seem to be confounded. They are either desperately clinging to a narrative of normality (it’s just a flu), or have already been forced to make embarrassing U-turns acknowledging the gravity of the crisis.Boris Johnson had to abandon the government’s “herd immunity” strategy when new scientific evidence made apparent its horrific human cost. He recently tested positive for the virus and is now accused of complacency and lack of leadership. In Italy, Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party and former deputy prime minister, appears downbeat, unable to wear the robes of the responsible statesman this emergency calls for his unabashed criticism of government has even earned him the label “unpatriotic”. In France, Marine Le Pen seems to have vanished altogether from the media, while Bolsonaro’s persistence in denying the crisis is leaving him increasingly isolated.The difficulties experienced by national populists are unsurprising given they are no friends of the issues at the heart of this crisis: health, welfare and science. On the health front, the crisis reveals the folly of decades of underfunding and privatisation of the health system. Trump, Johnson and Salvini have embarrassing questions to answer in regard to their record as enemies of public healthcare. Furthermore, the crisis calls for a sea change in economic policy that is at odds with the ideological premises of national populism, which combines chauvinism on the cultural front and ultra-neoliberal policies on the economic front.The glaring need for state protection of strategic national industries, starting with health equipment and pharmaceuticals, is no anathema for national-populists who have already embraced trade protectionism. But the populist right has strongly opposed welfare measures that are becoming a matter of necessity to avoid social catastrophe. Having repeatedly branded these policies as “dangerous” and “anti-patriotic”, these politicians find themselves in the embarrassing situation of having to espouse them.Another skeleton in the closet is national-populists’ disparagement of science. The coronavirus emergency confronts us with a threat that is best understood and measured through the lens of science. Epidemiologists and virologists have acquired media prominence and the public has been diligently following their recommendations. It is not clear whether this will lead to greater public trust in science and an erosion of the anti-science attitudes that national populist leaders have toyed with. However, it can be expected that citizens will take more heed of the risks flagged by scientists, including the climate emergency, which is also bound to exacerbate the spread of diseases.National-populists are well known for stoking people’s fears. But the fears now prevalent are not of the kind these leaders are best positioned to exploit. Due to the urgency of health and economic worries, migration – the populist right’s main enemy – has fallen in the list of priorities. Travel bans, and the fact that Europe and the US are the present focus of the pandemic, are leading to a drop in migration to these regions. In fact, we are now witnessing a historic reversal, with Mexico aiming to block the border with the US and African countries suspending flights from Europe, while UK farmers are organising charter planes to fly in farm workers from eastern Europe to prevent fruit and vegetables being left unpicked. However, if the global economic crisis results in a new wave of migration like that of 2015, this scenario could drastically change – national-populists will try to validate their narrative of cosmopolitan globalisation as a dangerous vector of all sorts of ills.If the coronavirus crisis has momentarily disoriented the populist right, this does not mean it is vanquished. It would be misguided for the left to believe that this crisis will work out in its favour. The health crisis is bound to be followed by a deep economic crisis, more similar to the Great Depression than to the 2008 financial crisis, and the populist right has already demonstrated its ability to prey on popular despair and find social scapegoats for economic ills. It can be expected that it will go down the same road, if anything becoming even more vicious.Given the ties among national-populists, including their botched attempt to establish a “nationalist international” under the auspices of Bannon’s Movement, this synchrony should not be taken as accidental. It has all the look of a coordinated strategy to channel the rage and despair caused by the crisis’s brutal human and economic toll towards a racial and ideological enemy conveniently identified in the Chinese government. Along with self-proclaimed socialists, all opponents are likely to be smeared as “Chinese collaborationists”: centrist US presidential candidate Joe Biden has already been termed “China’s choice for president” by the conservative National Review.What may be in store is thus something much worse than the populist right of the 2010s: an extreme right using the whole arsenal of the red scare and rightwing authoritarianism to intimidate opponents and defend its interests from demands for meaningful economic redistribution. Though it has been confounded by this crisis, the populist right has not been suppressed. It is just mutating.• Paolo Gerbaudo is a political theorist and the director of the Centre for Digital Culture at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83417411a89634c192255c0dc7aaa62a7fa40774/0_105_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5aeabd68963244d6015d22b869247a","title":"viktor orban pandemic power grab hungary","story":"If Hungary’s draconian experiment proves successful, then other illiberal countries will be tempted to follow suit The Hungarian parliament, which has a two-thirds majority in favour of the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, passed a bill on Monday 30 March that extended his already strong powers. The bill, not supported by most opposition MPs, gives parliamentary authorisation to prolong the state of emergency the government declared on 11 March in light of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the few remaining checks and balances in Hungary will cease to exist, with the government ruling by decree with hardly any legal supervision. No elections and no rallies can be held. Hungary has become a textbook case of how coronavirus can be abused for authoritarian ends.There is no sunset clause in the text, so the state of emergency will be in force for as long as the government wants. Changes to the criminal code mean the publication of facts that interfere with the “successful protection” of the public could be punished by five years in prison – a clear message to journalists. The government now also wants to effectively take over the running of local municipalities through supervising the decisions of directly elected leaders.The constitutional court could theoretically overrule the decisions implemented during the state of emergency, but given that its rights have been curbed and it has been stuffed with pro-government loyalists in recent years, we cannot expect that it will serve as an effective counterweight to the cabinet’s power. Likewise, although the parliament could officially terminate the state of emergency, it won’t. Orbán’s Fidesz-KDNP has a comfortable and loyal majority there has been not a single case in the past 10 years when Fidesz MPs have not supported a governmental decision.Why is Orbán doing this? For two reasons. The first is to label the opposition as the “supporters of the coronavirus”, instead of supporters of the people, winning the political debate in advance.Second: he sees this as the ideal opportunity for a power grab. When death is in the air, people tend to rally around their national flag, and their attention is narrowed. While the opposition and the free media covered the enabling act widely, the average Hungarian has seemed less concerned. He or she is more interested now in where to buy face masks.Strategically, Orbán knows that this is the perfect time to act: every country is dealing with how to save the lives of their citizens and at the same time avoid total economic collapse. In times of such crises, countries are becoming more inward-looking. Foreign policy, in general, becomes less important. Human rights and the rule of law in other countries are issues of little importance for most politicians and citizens.But they should be. There are many reasons why this is not only a domestic issue for Hungary, and why the international press, politicians and institutions should pay attention.First, Orbán is a role model for other illiberal leaders. If this experiment proves successful, many others will be encouraged to follow his path. If Hungary is not put in a political quarantine, a new wave of illiberalism will sweep through Europe, especially in the east. While there was strong criticism for Orbán’s latest move from many directions, the most important leaders of the biggest EU member states have remained silent about the enabling act. The president of the commission tweeted that emergency situations will be examined in all member states – without naming Hungary.Second, Orbán is working hard to tarnish the image of western alliances. While Hungary received €5.6bn to help protect it from the pandemic, members of its ruling class have been loudly accusing the EU of doing nothing but lecturing Hungary about democracy. Orbán justifies his eastern geopolitical shift, claiming that the EU is unable to help now – unlike China and members of the Turkic Council: Uzbekistan and Turkey. Hungary buys masks and respirators from the former and also receives some from the latter two. Also, the general consensus that authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China are dealing with coronavirus much better than democracies is receiving a lot of airtime in the pro-government media.Third, and this has received less attention, Orbán will use this as an opportunity to refashion the economy in his image. This could be bad news for some foreign investors in Hungary – especially when the economic problems worsen. The government is currently deploying a military taskforce to oversee the operation of 140 companies providing critical services (for example energy and retail) in the public and the private sectors alike. There are plans for the government to save companies – on condition that it owns the company in turn. We can expect the coming global economic slowdown and the decline of budget revenues to usher in some “unorthodox” economic measures that go against mainstream economic policies. Multinational companies will likely face levies, as has been done before, but this time without any meaningful legal obstacles. EU funds may be redirected to line the pockets of pro-government cronies more than ever before.The nature of extraordinary legal measures is that they are easy to introduce, but hard to undo. The “rally around the flag” effect won’t last for ever. And as the economic consequences of the pandemic become worse, Orbán may become increasingly unpopular – and the situation more desperate. The temptation to keep the emergency measures in place may become even stronger as the 2022 elections approach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8170860645ffa83def0e0b764e1e14882ce8a99a/0_14_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8b38897509ea85be48392c67bb9e73b","title":"why uk coronavirus testing work catchup","story":"Pursuing a controversial herd immunity strategy put the government on the back foot. Now it’s struggling to catch upTo stop a virus, you need to test for it. So why is it taking so long for the UK to increase its testing capacity? Although Public Health England is now aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day, the UK’s response still pales in comparison with Germany, which is reportedly managing to test about 70,000 people per day.The government’s inability to increase the number of tests is down to several factors. The kits have to be purchased in a global marketplace where demand has now exceeded supply. This raises the question: why didn’t we prepare sooner? According to some reports, the problem isn’t just one of availability, but timing. The government’s initial controversial policy of mitigation focused on the elderly and vulnerable, and mass testing was a secondary concern. At the point the government shifted its strategy to suppressing the virus and decided to roll out testing, it was already playing catchup. The government had made no preparations to increase the supply of testing kits or expand laboratory capacity – and the UK found itself at the back of the line in a global queue for tests. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200327-52465-Covid-19_+how_do_we_test_for_it.mp3 Historic factors have also shaped the UK’s current testing capacity. Over the past 20 years, the number of laboratories and testing facilities has shrunk. The public health laboratory service, a network of local and regional laboratories that was established as part of the NHS in 1946 to respond to the threat of bacteriological warfare, was subsumed by the health protection agency in 2003. Many of the laboratories in the old network were shut down, taken over by local hospitals or merged into a smaller number of regional laboratories.So even if it did have enough kits, the UK would no longer have the capacity, equipment or biomedical scientists to match the testing capacity of its European neighbours. But what if the tests could be done at home?This brings us to the question of the kinds of tests the UK will be conducting. Part of the confusion about testing has arisen from the fact there are two different types of test, which measure very different things. One detects the presence of the virus, and is sometimes referred to as the “antigen” test the other detects the presence of antibodies, sometimes referred to as the “serology”, or “antibody” test.The antigen test relies on molecular methods to detect the presence of the viral genetic material, usually in a nose or throat swab. This test is used to tell whether a person is currently infected and possibly infectious, and it needs samples to be sent to a testing laboratory. The antibody test, that will be available to conduct at home, detects whether the person actually had an infection at some time in the past – and indicates whether they are likely to be immune to further infection.This test is usually done on a spot of blood. Antibody tests typically do not become positive for a week or so after the beginning of an illness, so they are not much use for quickly diagnosing an acutely ill person – and won’t detect those who have only recently caught the virus.Criticisms of the UK’s testing numbers mainly concern the antigen tests. Several other countries, which have arguably been more successful at controlling their own epidemics – Germany, China and South Korea – have done many more antigen tests than the UK. South Korea has been running 20,000 tests a day. Even the US has completed more tests than the UK – 2,248 tests per million compared to the UK’s 1,923, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Importantly, the antigen test can show whether someone may be infectious to others, so it can be used to screen essential workers who may have only mild coronavirus symptoms, or who are asymptomatic.For now, the antigen tests are crucial for controlling the spread of the virus. But as we get over the peak of the epidemic, antibody tests will help us recover a semblance of normality. By detecting which iniduals are immune from the virus, they could allow them to return to work. Essential workers with immunity would not need to worry about getting infected or passing the virus to their families. Carers, social workers, the police and priests officiating at funerals could carry out their work as normal.Perhaps an even more important use of antibody tests is to fill some of the biggest gaps in our knowledge about the pandemic. How many people get only mild illness, or even do not get ill following an infection? Are younger people getting infected at the same rate as older adults? This information will be vital in helping us decide when and how the current social distancing measures can be relaxed, and when we can finally return to normal life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7f09f4dbaa6c9280baa5400d468beff8a081212/0_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb38f86cea847b73fd92b2e24b217a57","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of ambience","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘ambience’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘ambience’.Share your photos of what ambience means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 1 April at 10am.

Airlines have been appealing to governments for bailouts as fleets have been grounded.But campaigners and experts fear that after the Covid-19 outbreak has waned, the sector could bounce back with the aid of public money and send emissions soaring.In their letter to the chancellor, the campaigners – including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice – call for the government to take equity stakes in airlines rather than handing out cash or loans. They want to see social benefits with workers’ rights enforced, including a living wage and no mass redundancies a condition of any rescue. In the longer term, they want to see support for a “just transition” for workers to move to jobs in lower carbon industries.Rebecca Newsom, head of political affairs at Greenpeace UK, said: “Emergency funding must be used to tackle emergencies, not to support business as usual. Conditions are needed to protect workers’ rights, prevent public money from being erted into the pockets of shareholders, and reduce demand gradually over time through a frequent flier levy, so that the sector operates within safe limits for the climate.”Attaching conditions to any bailout could take several forms. Cañete wants to see a carbon tax or emissions trading system such as the one operating under the EU. “Market mechanisms are needed,” he said.Airlines UK, a trade body, said the industry was already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact before the coronavirus crisis hit. “The UK aviation sector has already committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the only national aviation industry to do so,” said a spokesperson. “This will be achieved via a range of measures, including airspace modernisation, the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels, new cleaner planes, and the UN carbon offsetting scheme Corsia.”Airlines face difficult choices ahead. More efficient aircraft will help to reduce emissions, but the impact will be limited. Biofuels offer a possible answer, but they are still expensive and there are difficulties in ensuring that the sources are environmentally sustainable. Electric planes are still some way in the future, and solar-powered flight a distant dream.“We need to stimulate research and development into things like hydrogen fuel,” said Barbara Buchner, managing director of the Climate Policy Initiative. “We need more proactive thinking from airlines – they can’t imagine we will go back to the way they were before.”The coronavirus disruption may also bring about permanent changes in people’s habits, some experts hope. Business flying has stopped meetings from happening, but people have found ways to work with video conferencing and other cheap technology, forcing businesses to question whether their staff need to fly as much in future.These eight companies are among those who will help you offset your carbon emissions. Here is an indication of the cost, and where the money will be spent:Climate CareCost: £17.61 for 2.35 tonnesProjects: Safe drinking water in Malawi, fuel efficiency in Ghana, landfill energy in Thailand, rainforests in BrazilAtmosfairCost: £106 for 5 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in South Africa, biogas in Nepal, wind and hydro powerCarbonfund.orgCost: $47 for 2.24 tonnesProjects: Water treatment in Kenya, hydroelectric in IndiaClevelCost: £38.74 for 2.6 tonnesProjects: Restoring grasslands in Mongolia, reducing deforestation in TanzaniaFlygreenCost: £20.79 for 2.4 tonnesProjects: Solar panels in IndiaMyclimateCost: £72 for 3.1 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in Africa, reforestation in NicaraguaCarbonfootprintCost: Between £7 and £30 a tonneProjects: Borehole rehabilitation in Uganda, hydroelectric in ChileGold StandardCost: Asks you to calculate your own emissions and choose a projectProjects: Water purifiers in Cambodia, fuel-efficient stoves in Sudan“We are not flying as much – why not keep not flying?” asked Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at Manchester University. “Why not reinforce the good things that are coming out of Covid-19?”One effect of the coronavirus crisis has yet to be felt. Under the Corsia (Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) system adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, airlines would have to curb their future emissions using efficiencies, alternative fuels and offsetting, such as investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects.Before the coronavirus crisis emerged, airlines pushed for the average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged. In any years from 2021 onwards, when emissions from the sector exceed the average of 2019 and 2020, the difference between actual emissions and the baseline will have to be offset, meaning airlines will have to buy carbon credits from carbon-cutting projects.Choosing 2019 and 2020 should have made those targets easy to meet for airlines if air travel had continued to rise this year as it has in recent years. With the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the disruption to travel means emissions are likely to be drastically lower than envisaged for 2020 – meaning Corsia’s future carbon targets will be much tougher for them to reach, if the scheme goes ahead without changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9f904b3bc22746f570dd2e72725740c8843595b/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33cdf03ccfef24e541c4773a51e65b0","title":"government set to make decision on uks largest coalmine","story":"Verdict expected after four years of protracted talks as production of the fossil fuel fell to record lows of 2.9m tonnes Ministers will decide this month whether to give the green light to plans for the UK’s largest coalmine after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists.A letter from the government’s lawyers, seen by the , said the government will draw a line on the protracted battle to develop an opencast mine at Highthorn in Northumberland by giving a verdict on the plans by Tuesday 7 April.The decision is expected over four years after the Banks Group, a Durham-based infrastructure firm, first put forward its plans to produce 3m tonnes of coal from the opencast mine for Britain’s steel and cement sector.The company’s lawyers wrote to the government earlier this month demanding a decision on the “vital” coal project, saying it could help meet the “important national need for industrial coal”.A spokesman for the company added that the “corona crisis” could threaten the UK’s imports, although there is no evidence that coal shipments have been impacted so far.The UK’s reliance on coal to generate electricity has fallen to record lows in recent years but the fossil fuel is still used to make steel and manufacture cement, requiring imports of coal from Russia and the US.The UK used 7.9m tonnes of coal last year, down by a third from the year before according to official figures, while domestic coal production fell to record lows of 2.9m tonnes.Environmentalists are strongly opposed to the plans to open new mines in the UK while it moves towards a ban on coal-fired electricity from 2025.Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It is distastefully opportunistic to use a public health crisis to argue for a new coalmine.”“Coronavirus is rightly the world’s priority right now, but that doesn’t mean we can afford to make another crisis worse. And to deal with the climate emergency we need to leave the vast majority of the world’s coal in the ground,” he added.The plan was rejected two years ago by Sajid Javid, the former minister for communities and local government, after an 18-month review concluded that the environmental impact of the mine would outweigh its economic benefits.The decision was overturned by the High Court eight months later after a judge ruled that Javid’s reasoning for disregarding the support of the planning inspectorate, which backed the project, was “significantly inadequate”.The Banks Group argues that mining coal domestically would have a smaller carbon footprint than importing coal by sea and rail. The same argument was put forward in favour of UK shale gas development, but failed to win over energy ministers who announced an indefinite moratorium on all fracking in England last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09245984beaa9f058d7787fe6967e1194d4dee18/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1158d3d19bac66ec9704f2ff3ce9fa2","title":"really amazing scientists show that fish migrate through the deep oceans","story":"Analysis of underwater photographs has demonstrated what marine biologists have long suspected – seasonal fish migrationsNew research has finally demonstrated what many marine biologists suspected but had never before seen: fish migrating through the deep sea.The study, published this month in the Journal of Animal Ecology, used analysis of deep-sea photographs to show a regular increase in the number of fish in particular months, suggesting seasonal migrations.Tracking fish in the deep sea is challenging. They are sparsely distributed, the water is nearly devoid of sunlight, and the monitoring equipment has to withstand enormous pressure.The study used photographs taken by the Deep-ocean Environmental Long-term Observatory System (Delos), two observatories on the sea bed 1,400m below the surface, off the coast of Angola. The researchers analysed 12,703 photographs – only 502 of which had actually managed to capture a fish – taken over seven-and-a-half years, and found that each year, in late November and June, there was a spike in the number of fish.“It is certainly not unprecedented but it has never really been demonstrated,” says Rosanna Milligan, an assistant professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida and the lead author on the paper. “That is what we were able to do with this study.”“Even after all these years, one of my favourite parts of being a scientist is when you do those first graphs of your results and start to see something emerging from the data,” says David Bailey, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow and a co-author on the paper. “That’s one of the greatest thrills of the whole scientific endeavour. It was really, really amazing.”Even with this new discovery, Milligan and Bailey still say there is a lot they don’t know.“The natural thing to do is to find out where the fish are coming from and going to when they move around,” says Bailey. “What is going on? What does it mean and what are the fish doing?”Very little is known about the behaviour of any of the fish photographed. Grenadiers, a family of fish seen in more than 100 of the Delos photos, have long tails that may allow them to move great distances at low speed – but despite being a relatively common deep-sea fish, little information exists on how far they can swim. A 1992 paper, for instance, put acoustic tracking devices in bait and fed them to grenadiers, but the devices only tracked the fish up to 1km away.Milligan thinks the fish might be migrating to follow dying organisms on the surface. Plankton blooms off the coast of west Africa every year four months before the deep-sea fish migrate into the area. Given that the deep sea is dependent on life at the surface that dies and sinks to the bottom, it is possible that other animals could be gathering to take advantage of the dying plankton, and the deep-sea fish migrate to eat those.“We just have no idea how these things act,” says Tim O’Hara, a researcher and senior curator of marine zoology at Museums Victoria, Australia, who was not involved in the research. “We are literally groping in the dark. It’s kilometres down in the ocean and we get these tiny bits of information from one or two locations and we’re trying to put together a big picture.”Milligan and Bailey hope this discovery encourages other researchers to look for similar patterns in the deep oceans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9121a6f19c3e4621bd5b71af48d83dd4dc1898f2/0_275_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bc23c17711a63e8b0c84277f59dc00b","title":"david athertons recipe for buckwheat pancakes","story":"These Breton galettes couldn’t be easier to make – and work with both savoury and sweet toppingsThis is the perfect brunch: the batter is really quick to whip up and will have time to ferment while you take your daily exercise.

In the days that immediately followed the coronavirus lockdown in the UK, the website of the retailer Majestic Wine crashed amid fears of a shortage of alcohol.The academics from the Belgian city of Louvain behind the study, Ferreira Silva Guimarães, Antonio Carlos and Sonia Collin, examined the changes in the “bitterness units” in 21 Belgian dry-hopped beers.While it has long been known that the flavour of beer changes over time, the impact of age on highly hopped and especially dry hopped beers has not been examined. In recent years, sales have been on the rise for beers made with strongly flavoured hops derived from the Humulus lupulus plant, or with whole hops added in the fermentation process.The scientists report that humulones, cis-humulinones and hulupones are key to the “sensory and measured bitterness of these beers”.Belgium is Europe’s biggest exporter of beer, according to the latest statistics produced by the Brewers of Europe federation, with exports of 15.8m hectolitres followed by Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.

Delicious to eat and quick to cook, it’s easy to see why pad thai has been so successful at bringing a country together.120g rice noodles, ideally 2-3mm wide flat rice sticks, but any will do really60ml fish sauce, or light soy sauce mixed with a little lime juice or rice vinegar60ml tamarind water (or tamarind concentrate thinned with a little water)60g palm sugar, or maple sugar, maple syrup reduced until caramelised, or dark brown sugar1 pinch chilli powder, to taste2 garlic cloves, peeled100g extra-firm tofu, drained8 large prawns2 large eggs25g preserved salted radish (optional)4 stalks Chinese chives, or spring onions50g roasted peanuts80ml groundnut or vegetable oil1 tbsp small dried shrimp (optional)100g beansproutsLime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnishPad thai cooks in minutes, so it’s essential to have all the ingredients prepped and ready before you so much as look at the wok. Begin by soaking the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour, until pliable but still al dente, rather than soft. Drain well and set aside by the hob alongside a small glass of cold water.While the noodles are soaking, make the pad thai sauce. Put the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan and heat gently, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then turn off the heat. Season with chilli, then taste and adjust the balance to suit your palate. Prepare the remaining ingredients and set them out near the hob in the order they go into the pan (as below). Finely chop the garlic and cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes. Devein the prawns, if necessary (I like to leave them unshelled, but it’s up to you), and crack the eggs into a small bowl. Roughly chop the radish (if using), chives and peanuts.Before you turn on the hob, get ready your serving dishes, cutlery, accompaniments and any dining companions, because the cooking process is very fast. Put a wok on a high heat and, once hot, add half the oil, followed by the garlic, and stir-fry for a few seconds, until aromatic.Add the drained noodles to the wok, along with a splash of the water from the glass, tossing to break up any clumps. Fry until they start to dry out, then add the sauce and cook, tossing continuously, until the noodles are almost done (they should still be slightly chewy, ideally, but it’s a matter of taste just bear in mind that they’ll be cooked a little more before you’re finished).Push the noodles to the side of the wok, so they’re no longer over a direct heat, then pour the remaining oil into the pan. Add the tofu and prawns, and cook, stirring, until the prawns are pink and the tofu starts to colour, then push these to the side of the pan along with the noodles.Pour the eggs into the wok, then break the yolks with your spatula, or whatever implement you’re using to stir-fry. Once the eggs are beginning to set on the bottom of the pan, scramble them roughly and cook until they separate into dry curds.Push the noodles, tofu and prawns back into the middle of the wok and add the radish (if using), dried shrimp, beansprouts, chives and peanuts. Toss together, until everything is well combined, then serve up either in inidual portions or on one big platter, along with the garnishes for diners to add as they wish.This is an easy dish to make vegan, if that’s your preference: fish sauce substitutes are fairly widely available these days (as are gluten-free ones, incidentally), and you can add extra tofu to make up for the animal products (scrambled soft tofu can stand in for the eggs), or add a vegetable of your choice instead, cooking or blanching it first, if need be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a243224ef387ee4959172a43c9a3d45bbfab5e2/0_114_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f598ca22baccdb239ad2d33b73e3e7","title":"shoppers hoard yeast solution soda bread","story":"When this crisis first broke, I felt I knew for the first time what really mattered. Now I’m focusing again on the small worries – including my flour shortageThere is so much I don’t understand about all this ghastly business. But one question torments me above all others: where has all the bloody yeast gone?First, they came for the toilet roll. And then for the flour. The strong white bread flour was first to go, followed by the plain white, the wholemeal, the self-raising and then, in no particular order, the rye, the spelt, the khorasan and all the other mysterious varieties that no one normally buys. Soon there was none.I was livid. I thought I was the only clever dick clever enough to bake his own bread. Who were these flour thieves? I know we are all in this together blah blah, but this was beyond the pale. I bet these arrivistes watched a couple of Bake Offs and bought Paul Hollywood’s book, which I dare say has remained unopened. Well, good luck to the lot of you.The first flour to make it back on to the shelves in my supermarket was strong white bread flour, in big 3kg bags. I had a glowering standoff with a bloke who had the last one clutched to his chest like a rugby player going into a maul. I would happily have fought him, as he was much smaller than me, but couldn’t have done so without breaching social distancing guidelines. We were nose-to-nose, resembling fighters at a weigh-in, except these floury fighters’ noses were 200cm apart. He flicked his eyes upwards to the top shelf. There were three more bags up there I hadn’t seen. So I forgave him and the matter was closed.When this crisis first broke, I felt I knew for the first time what really mattered: the health of loved ones, and not much else. Big things I had previously worried about suddenly seemed so small. But then the small things, like bread flour, themselves became big things.I have flour now but nowhere, anywhere, can I get yeast. Where has it all gone? There must be so much out there that if a biblical flood were added to our woes, all this unused yeast would dissolve in it and rise up, frothing, to bake us in a giant crusty loaf of calamity.Luckily, I don’t need yeast. Since I was a student, I have been fascinated by Irish soda bread. When I was revising for my finals in 1990, I tore a recipe out of a newspaper and, seeing a fine excuse not to read any more stupid Henry James, I got busy. I have been fiddling away trying to perfect this recipe for 30 years now, to the extent that it’s now no more authentically Irish than I am. But it is, if I may say so, perfect. This is my gift to the yeastless:Combine 15g of bicarbonate of soda, 10g of salt, 5g of caraway seeds, a handful of porridge oats or any other random seeds you have. Then mix that with 400g of a combination of any flours you have. Stir in half a litre of any milk, soured with the juice of one lemon. Then melt together a generous tablespoon of black treacle and an equally generous teaspoon of Marmite in a small pan and stir that in, too. Lick the Marmiteytreacly pan clean it’s a taste sensation. You should now have either a sloppy dough or stiff batter, depending on how you look at it. Bake at 190C (fan-assisted) for an hour in a one-litre loaf tin.The yeast-rich can try it when they finally run out in five years or so.• Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/766a4a6a0e1866df6f91cd26eea9f5e6ebc80cf5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=76eda499a3e6ab08557412e584ad48fe","title":"premier league clubs accused of being in moral vacuum over pay coronavirus","story":"Premier League football has been accused of operating in a “moral vacuum” after clubs cut wages or furloughed non-playing staff but continued to pay players their full wage.Before a meeting on Wednesday at which the Premier League, English Football League and Professional Footballers’ Association will continue talks regarding pay, there was outspoken criticism from politicians.Julian Knight, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: “It sticks in the throat. This exposes the crazy economics in English football and the moral vacuum at its centre.”The Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, said when announcing his club’s move that top-flight managers and players should help English football deal with the financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic by accepting lower pay.It is understood the Premier League will report back to its clubs at Friday’s shareholders’ meeting before confirming any agreement on deferrals.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told BBC Radio 5 Live: “Highly-paid football players are people who can carry the greatest burden and they should be the first one to, with respect, sacrifice their salary, rather than the person selling the programme or the person who does catering or the person who probably doesn’t get anywhere near the salary Premier League footballers get.”The PFA is understood to be resisting deferment of players’ wages until negotiations have been held with clubs inidually demonstrating cash flow problems and a genuine need to make savings now.

From polar scientists to monks and solo sailors, they offer tipsDierickx is a postdoctoral fellow in experimental cosmology at Harvard, and spends two to three months a year at the Amundsen-Scott station at the south pole carrying out maintenance on her department’s telescopes. “It’s a very unchanging environment and you can’t really go outside,” she says, “so a lot of the psychological implications are similar to what we are experiencing now. I found that in my time there I would try to control my environment more. For example, we have lab space there and I would obsessively clean it, and I am doing the same thing now, stuck in my apartment.”Dierickx, 29, also becomes very attentive to change. “Things like plants that grow noticeably or changing the decor of your room. It’s a good way to channel energy,” she says. “Nurturing our environment can only help our psychological balance.”How does she find living in such close proximity to a small group of people? “That is one of the main challenges,” she says. “Especially if there is someone you don’t get along with. I’ve found that I have to proactively use my good side, try to repair relationships and work on my generosity. I confront people with kindness.”Ramsey captained the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Turbulent from 2008-11. “Submariners are trained to deal with isolation, whereas the public aren’t,” he says. “For the general public, it’s a wicked problem that they’re trying to tame. “The first thing to do is get into a routine. It needs discipline. Do the same things in the same order every day. Make the weekends different. You have to differentiate time.”Ramsey suggests limiting your exposure to TV news. “The constant news is such a dynamic change at the moment and it’s all negative,” he says. “Picking it up once a day will give you time to do other stuff.” He also stresses the importance of exercise. “If you are healthy physically, you will be healthy mentally. I used to exercise with dumbbells in my cabin, which was tiny. And keep mentally fit as well. It’s about reading books and doing something different. This is an ideal opportunity to learn something new.”He describes a submarine as “a steel tube with 130 people in it” and admits there can be friction on a long deployment. “De-conflict early,” he says. “Have a chat find out what the issues are.”His final piece of advice is to “enjoy what’s there”. Focus on what you have got rather than what you are being denied. “Try to stay off the topic of what happens next,” he says. “You can only control what you can control.” Jamison is president of the English Benedictine Congregation and author of Finding Happiness: Monastic Steps for a Fulfilling Life. Drawing on almost 50 years experience as a monk, he has helped set up a website, alonetogether.org.uk, which addresses loneliness and self-sufficiency raised by the current crisis.“The whole country is going through waves of different feelings,” Jamison says. “One that came up most in the early stages was anger. People were angry with people in supermarkets angry with people who were stockpiling angry with people who didn’t stay at home. There is also a lot of fear around and, later, people will feel lonely and bored.”How does the monastic tradition help counter such feelings? “If you just leave the day undifferentiated, it can get on top of you. But if you create your own rhythm, you’ll find that the day is more sustainable, bearable and enjoyable.”Jamison draws a distinction between boredom and lethargy. “Boredom is when there is absolutely nothing to do. Lethargy is when there are things to do that you can’t be bothered doing. Most people suffer the latter, but they call it the former because it lets them off the hook. In the monastery, people are always ringing bells telling you what to do next, so you don’t have time to be bored.”Positivity is the key. “Do not begin the day by rehearsing your grievances. Begin by remembering you’re alive and there are good things still. You may have to do tough things later, but take it one step at a time. Begin with gratitude then ask for the grace to face the day and its difficulties. Then go and address the difficulties.” Doesn’t all that presuppose a belief in God? “You can,” Jamison insists, “be grateful without believing in God.”In 1969, Knox-Johnston became the first person to make a nonstop single-handed circumnavigation of the globe when he was the only competitor in a round-the-world yacht race to make it home. He was in his late 20s, and sailing a 32ft yacht the journey took 312 days. Ten weeks into the voyage, Knox-Johnston’s radio broke down. “It was very frustrating,” he says. “I could hear people calling me, but I couldn’t respond.” For four and a half months, nothing was heard of him. The Times prepared an obituary.How did he keep himself together mentally? “That worried me,” he admits. “I took to learning poetry. I had a lovely anthology by Field Marshal Wavell called Other Men’s Flowers. I committed all these wonderful poems to memory. I’d sit there steering while reciting to myself.“I tried to keep to a regular schedule. Sleep during the night, although obviously at times you couldn’t because you had to be on deck. I’d make myself dinner, check everything was all right, then go and have some sleep, wake three or four hours later, check things, go back to bed again. Then, as the sun rose, I’d get up, have a cup of coffee, make breakfast, check the boat and take my sights to work out where I was.” Food was fairly basic, but he had taken 12 bottles of whisky, 12 of brandy and 120 cans of beer, and he enjoyed a whisky or brandy with a cigarette before dinner. Did he ever get drunk? “You’re on your own,” he says emphatically. “That would be pretty stupid.”Did he miss company? “Oh God, yes,” he says, just as emphatically. “Going past Australia with my receiver working and picking up dance music on a Saturday night. You thought: ‘What the hell am I doing out here on my own?’ But then you think: ‘I’m still in this. I’m not giving this up for anything.’” And sex? “You have to put it out of your mind,” he says. “You need all your energy for the boat.”Byrne has lived with her husband on the island of Colonsay (population 135) in the Inner Hebrides for more than 40 years, first running a hotel and now a bookshop.  It is one of the most isolated communities in the UK. For Byrne self-sufficiency is a way of life. “Other people are used to shopping every day for what they’re going to eat,” she says. “We shop for a month. It’s a completely different mindset.”There are pros and cons to island life. “There is no crime, and people look out for each other. On the other hand, people know everyone else’s business.” Does the isolation ever get her down? “No”, she says. “I am a very easy person. But for some people it’s almost impossible. That’s why we can’t sustain much of a population here. It’s heaven on a spring morning, but for weeks and months in the winter it’s really hard.”Byrne says the years-long feuds that used to characterise island life have lessened. “People have their opinions and sometimes it would make your hair curl listening to what people say, but overall we do realise we’re all in this together.” She also says the drinking culture is not what it was. “People have woken up to the fact that having at least one car in the ditch every weekend is not a good idea.”Her tips for the newly isolated? “Keep busy. Don’t slouch around. Get up in the morning, get dressed, have a plan. It’s too easy to fritter away your time, and that is very soul-destroying.” Does she ever get bored? “I don’t really,” she says. “There’s always a good book to read, especially if you own a bookshop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad183acc3f81d16c084096aa04e9e9c92fa1c1e4/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecde454562a1be3aadb5a939a5fa1eba","title":"big issue to be sold in stores for first time after street sales paused","story":"Magazine will be sold in McColl’s and Sainsbury’s outlets to raise money for homeless vendorsThe Big Issue is to go on sale in supermarkets for the first time in an effort to make money for vendors left without income during the coronavirus outbreak.The magazine, normally sold on the street by homeless people, is to be sold in selected Sainsbury’s and McColl’s stores after sales were paused on 22 March to protect the health of its vendors.John Bird, who set up the Big Issue 29 years ago, said: “The future of the magazine is at risk if we don’t get £60,000 through subscriptions for the magazine or digital issues. If we don’t get that within a month or two we will have nothing, as all our income comes from the street sellers. We have never built up large banks of money, and all the money raised has gone back to the product.”He added: “For health reasons we stopped selling it on the streets the weekend before last and we have been campaigning to turn the magazine into a digital magazine or one you can buy through subscription or at supermarkets and newsagents.”Bird said the money would be given to homeless vendors around the country, and the organisation was trying to track down around 500 sellers. It has already been in contact with 1,000 iniduals.“It will take longer for the vendors to get money than it normally would, but it will start to flow once the system is up and running. At the moment we are building the system,” he said.Customers will be able to purchase copies in 164 Sainsbury’s stores initially, extending to 315 over the coming weeks, and 1,430 McColl’s stores, for the price of £3. The Big Issue is also going to be launching an app. “You can also buy a magazine online or subscribe for three months whilst your vendor isn’t on the street,” Bird added.Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We are proud to be supporting a cause as important as The Big Issue Group, which exists to offer homeless people, or iniduals at risk of becoming homeless, the opportunity to earn an income. Coronavirus has affected everyone in the UK, and it’s important that we show our support for each other in these increasingly challenging times.“We hope that by providing a means for our customers to purchase a copy of the Big Issue, we can encourage people to continue to buy the magazine, which so many vulnerable people rely on.”Since the Big Issue launched in 1991, more than 200 million copies have been sold by more than 100,000 vulnerable people.

Publishers say that words related to the pandemic – such as coronavirus and Covid-19 - are appearing on blacklists across the industry.This has meant that while national and regional newspaper publishers are gaining record numbers of digital readers seeking to keep up to date about the pandemic, publishers are struggling to make ad revenue from their interest.Advertisers’ blacklist technology is also indiscriminate meaning that even positive or innocuous pieces such as those on the Joe Wicks YouTube PE phenomenon, family activities for the housebound, or articles recommending TV shows, films and books to read in isolation are also shorn of adverts.“While we have seen a huge surge in demand from readers for trusted, accurate reporting, advertising ‘blacklists’ are preventing adverts from appearing alongside online stories with the word coronavirus in them,” said Tracy De Groose, executive chair of Newsworks, the campaigning body for the UK newspaper industry. “If the pandemic lasts for another three months the total loss across our news brands is expected to be £50m, threatening our ability to fund the quality journalism that is vital to ensure that the UK public is accurately informed during the crisis.”The UK’s national and regional newspaper publishers have put their rivalries to one side and published an open letter calling on advertisers to rethink the addition of coronavirus-related words to blacklists.In the industry letter scheduled to be published on Wednesday, De Groose says: “We understand many marketing budgets are under real pressure now. All we ask is that when you launch your next campaign you check you’re not unknowingly blocking trusted news brands from your plans.”Publishers also feel they are not being treated fairly as other platforms flooded with coronavirus content, such as social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, are not treated in the same way by advertisers.“Publishers are the only ones who are punished, in an advertising sense, for reporting and distributing the news that society desperately needs. The system needs an overhaul, the technology needs improving.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a6901a1b531d4dae114b182b2b81e37def2ad51/0_131_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d013cdd8dfe195c0956c43141fafb18","title":"tv licence fee could be replaced by broadband levy says bbc","story":"Corporation responds to government plan to decriminalise non-payment of licence feeThe BBC has said the television licence fee could ultimately be replaced by a monthly levy on broadband connections, in response to the UK government’s proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee.The public broadcaster said it strongly supported keeping the current court-enforced television licence fee system in place for the medium-term. But it is willing to consider following other European countries and implement a funding model “linked directly to an existing common household bill” such as an internet connection, council tax, or electricity supply.“This would be a significant change for the UK and we are not, at this stage, advocating it,” the corporation said in its submission. “It does however raise an interesting question as to whether the current system could be made much simpler, more efficient and more automated. We are open to exploring this further.”The consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee closes on Wednesday, with the BBC warning that the initial cost of creating a new system where non-payment is enforced as a civil debt – similar to a utility bill – would be almost £300m.The former culture secretary Nicky Morgan launched the consultation on decriminalisation two months ago, in the aftermath of a rancorous general election campaign in which the BBC’s news output came under fire from across the political spectrum. At the time, Downing Street was picking a fight with the BBC, stopping ministers from appearing on major political programmes and warning of a forthcoming upheaval and a need to cut the corporation down to size.The approach has changed substantially since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with Downing Street making peace with news outlets and the BBC – along with other broadcasters - attracting enormous audiences for its programmes featuring prime ministerial press conferences and providing public health advice.The corporation argued strongly that the existing criminal sanctions should remain in force until the BBC’s royal charter is renewed in 2027, arguing that – unlike a civil system – magistrates had the flexibility to impose appropriate fines that take into account an inidual’s circumstances.About 130,000 people were prosecuted in 2018 for non-payment of the licence fee, with the substantial majority being women who are more likely to live alone or be at home when enforcement officials knock on doors. Five people in England and Wales were ultimately sent to prison for failing to pay court-ordered fines.“The BBC is a universal service – one to which everyone contributes and everyone receives something in return,” said the BBC in its argument to maintain the current system. “Any system based on a universal contribution must have a sufficient deterrent and sanction to ensure that principle holds up and the system is fair to those who do pay, as well as those who don’t.”It also pointed out that the current system indirectly subsidised the court system, through the estimated £28m a year charged in magistrates’ fees to people prosecuted for non-payment.The BBC is already facing a financial black hole, having suspended this summer’s planned introduction of the licence fee for most over-75s by at least two months, to ensure older viewers do not feel threatened or cut off. Cuts to BBC News staffing levels have also been postponed, while the national lockdown has also led to the suspension of visits to homes by TV licensing officials, meaning evasion is likely to increase as people suspected of watching television without a licence are no longer being chased for payment.Many iniduals in the corporation view the lockdown as a chance to show ministers what a public service broadcaster can do for a country in crisis, especially with commercial media outlets facing a dire outlook due to a collapse in the advertising market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4dc56a12bce0f488850c89ae9a3b641c58145c/587_1213_1633_980/master/1633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0e3f9f44da25fa82fb8c8ad83aa55fb","title":"chuck d flavor flav public enemy split hoax bernie sanders rally rappers","story":"Spat over Bernie Sanders rally announced as ‘catastrophe to wake people up’, as new track is launched featuring both rappersChuck D has said that Flavor Flav is still a member of Public Enemy, and his recent firing from the group was a satirical hoax.On 1 March, Chuck D said the group would be “moving forward without Flavor Flav”, his colourful sideman since the inception of the political hip-hop group in the mid-1980s, adding: “We thank him for his years of service and wish him well.” He subsequently claimed he had been sued by Flav – which Flav denied on Twitter – and that Flav had been suspended from the group since 2016, complaining that he “always chose to party over work”. He also added that Flav “better find rehab”, and accused him of being motivated solely by money.The spat seemed to have been triggered by Flav not performing at a Bernie Sanders rally, with Flav stating via lawyers that he had not endorsed “any political candidate in this election cycle”, and that Chuck D was not allowed to use Public Enemy’s image to endorse a candidate: “While Chuck is certainly free to express his political view as he sees fit – his voice alone does not speak for Public Enemy.”Flav himself tweeted: “You wanna destroy something we’ve built over 35 years over politics? … I’ve been clean for 10 years \u0026amp there is no PE wo Flavor Flav. I’m worried about you Chuck, you can ide people or bring people together, y’all know what side I’m on.”He added: “Flav doesn’t do benefits and stays away from political events – we been cool and always agreed about that.” He detailed the difference between Public Enemy – a group featuring him and Flav – with Enemy Radio, an “auxiliary unit” that features all the members except Flav, and which performed at the Bernie Sanders rally, in Los Angeles on 1 March.The announcement came alongside a new single, billed as Enemy Radio featuring Public Enemy, that reunites Chuck D and Flavor Flav on a track.

The lyrics attack the US Food and Drug Administration, sugar intake, and the use of pesticides and chemicals in food production. An Enemy Radio album, Loud Is Not Enough, was also announced.He argued that only negative news stories get traction – “The news you read about hip-hop is about another dead rapper” – and that this was proved by the news of him firing Flav, that “actually proves the fact the gadgets are ruling the game”.Flavor Flav has not commented on the announcement or the interview."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234e3895df704f113bff6131aac5c0ddae63a939/0_0_3068_1841/master/3068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbd88a4c1d7a93a04cd03f773d89683","title":"ravi shankar where to start in his back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: don’t let the Indian sitar master’s daunting discography of 75 albums and 15 scores put you off Eternally pictured sitting cross-legged and barefoot, clutching his enormous sitar, wreathed in incense smoke with his head tilted askew as if in reverence to his own improvisations, Ravi Shankar has done more than perhaps any other modern musician to personify the deeply complex and meditative intricacies of Indian classical music in the western world over the past century. With a catalogue of more than 75 albums and 15 film scores, his is a daunting discography.The soundtrack to his 1971 autobiographical film Raga is the perfect place to start. Since Indian classical is a live and largely improvised music, these live recordings – including some from 1967’s Monterey Pop festival – are an invigorating, condensed introduction to the crescendos of the raga song structure. With performances that in India might have lasted five hours or more, here Shankar provides his own highlights, with snatches of ragas lasting closer to three minutes than 30.Opening with the rhythmic foundations of the genre on EastWest Introductions, Shankar counts the 13-beat ardha jaital cycle while virtuoso tabla player Alla Rakha fires out polyrhythms with the force of a man with at least four hands. Other highlights come on the Medley of Raga Parameshwari and Raga Rangeshwari where we skip straight into some of Shankar’s most intricate harmonic phrasings before segueing into the calm meditations of Banaras Ghat.On The Spirit of the Raga, we hear Shankar explaining the spiritual import of his music, its deeper meaning beyond technicality. It is a combination of “reverence, fear and humility, since the ragas, he says, are like people – you have to be awestruck by them” in order to open up to the power of the improvisation. “It is only then that listeners enter into something they are not aware of, an adventure … where I feel they are with me.” This is the real power of Shankar’s music – to allow a deeper meaning to envelop as you listen.Live: Ravi Shankar at the Monterey International Pop FestivalShankar’s 1967 show at the Monterey Pop festival is perhaps Shankar’s most famous live performance, and certainly the one that cemented him as a somewhat unwilling hippie figurehead. Captured in part in Raga, this subsequent release features his 53-minute show in full.The 27-minute opener Raga Bhimpalasi features Shankar solo, taking his time with the free-form alap intro before moving into the deeper register of his sitar and percussively plucking to the intricate crescendo of the closing jhala. A half-hour solo is a bold opening move – and yet this is the essence of Shankar’s playing: you can hear him easing into the composition and then approaching his improvisation to grasp at the notes of his expression. Before long, you can picture him in a free-flow rapture, playing in an otherworldly communing with his instrument.Alla Rakha’s tabla solo then adds a more earthy form of virtuosity before the closing Dhun, which builds with such intensity that you can hear the rapturous applause swelling from the crowd as Shankar and Rakha exchange passages with lightning intensity. With both Shankar and Rakha now long gone, this is the closest we can get to experiencing the magic of their deeply felt musical telepathy.Improvisations and Theme from Pather PanchaliShankar was not only a distinguished performer but also an accomplished composer of orchestral works and film scores. One of his earliest and most notable works was for Bengali director Satyajit Ray’s revelatory Apu Trilogy.In his music for the first film of the trilogy, Pather Panchali, Shankar chose to largely improvise his scoring work in the studio, as opposed to the norm of rigorously writing out arrangements. It hits the sweet spot between free-form expression and precision, providing an ideal backdrop to the visual saga of Ray’s protagonist Apu. Mixing Indian tradition with western classical – a theme Shankar would go on to explore with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Philip Glass – he veers from the bright melody of the theme to the fast-paced melodrama of Fire Night and then the sweeping build of Raga Rageshri to mirror the bildungsroman journey of young Apu. A masterclass in instrumental scene-setting.Chants of IndiaA late-period passion project, Chants of India explores Shankar’s enduring commitment to the spiritual import of Indian classical, as well as providing a record of his close friendship with George Harrison.Harrison produced the record, which puts ancient Sanskrit invocations for peace, love and harmony into new musical settings, including the track Prabhujee, which features a rare vocal performance from Shankar himself along with his wife Sukanya. The result is a deeply calming and moving collection the perfect balm for your possible isolation anxiety, as well as a reflection on Shankar and Harrison’s partnership.Shankar’s work has long been admired by jazz musicians for its use of improvisation and complex rhythm – most notably by John Coltrane, whose late-period spirituality caused him to seek out Shankar and ultimately name his own son Ravi.Jazzmine is the only jazz recording Shankar made. It’s a remarkable if overlooked album. A live ensemble consisting of a 19-piece Indian orchestra, five jazz musicians and four vocalists, this all-star fusion of jazz swing and raga harmony is a concept that has been attempted since but never bettered for feeling. While the recording quality is poor, the musicians’ enthusiasm, especially on the finale Mishrank, is palpable and kinetic.Ravi Shankar: The Rolling Stone Interview, by Sue C ClarkA classic interview with Shankar at the height of his 60s fame by one of his west coast disciples. A glimpse into his no-frills approach to the Indian classical tradition – “If something is done beautifully I will certainly appreciate it” – as well as the burgeoning and culturally appropriative hippie movement surrounding his music.

This allows the males to monopolise the female and prevent her from being ‘stolen’ by a rival social group.Researchers have previously found members of these small alliances move in sync – including leaping, turning and surfacing at the same time. That, said King, is thought to aid bonding between males. “It is a signal of unity,” she said.But now researchers have found dolphins also match up their vocalisations.The team followed 59 male dolphins from seven different lifelong social groups, recording sequences of short, low frequency pulse sounds, or pops, they produce when they teamed up in pairs or trios to hustle females. Overall the team recorded 453 sequences of pops, 172 of which were made by multiple males.The team then looked at data for a number of these pairs to explore patterns in the vocalisations – focusing on sequences of pops, since pops are not produced on their own.When the team looked at five dolphin pairs from different social groups, they found four pairs showed partners matching the tempo of their popping sequences. “One male is getting faster then slower then faster, and the other male is matching him in that,” said King.The team adds that as the dolphin pairs were from different social groups, the findings are not a quirk of one particular collection of males: indeed further analysis on the wider data set showed such behaviour was widespread.Crucially, said King, the findings reflect vocalisation during cooperative rather than competitive behaviour. “The males aren’t attracting a female here, they have her, they are herding her,” she said, adding that males seem to father similar numbers of offspring.That, she said, means that humans are not the only animals for which moving and vocalising in sync is linked to cooperative behaviour.Dr James Herbert-Read, a biologist at Cambridge University, who was not involved in the study, described the research as fascinating. “Why these dolphins synchronise their calls remains unclear, but the authors aim to address this in future studies,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbfde8dfc6100b17b163ecab0cfe9c1cd4ac2344/0_196_6048_3631/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ba70b2a12c8a122d4cf93a5bcfd326","title":"coronavirus and volunteering how can i help in the uk","story":"From lending a hand to local charities to bolstering the efforts of the NHS, there are many ways to get involvedThere are plenty of ways to get involved. Many local charities will be keen to attract new volunteers – especially as older stalwarts are forced to stay at home. Or there are national schemes, such as NHS volunteer responders. Some bigger charities, such as the Trussell Trust food bank network, have set up their own online schemes to match volunteers with food banks in their area. Local volunteer centres and organisations such as Volunteering Matters and Do-it can link you up with charities close to where you live. Reach Volunteering will match people with specialist professional skills, such IT expertise, to charities who need their help.The health service in England has put out a call for volunteer responders to help medical staff with tasks such as: delivering medicines from pharmacies driving patients to appointments bringing them home from hospital and making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home. More than 500,000 people have already signed up. More details are on the NHS England website.Keeping an eye out for neighbours and family members is the simplest way to help people who are vulnerable, lonely, self-isolating or busy key workers. Help could mean anything from running errands to the shops to providing a friendly voice of reassurance and support. Covid-19 Mutual Aid was set up to co-ordinate “good neighbour” initiatives and has lists of local groups in your area, together with details of how to help people safely.Yes. According to Shaun Delaney of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, exceptions to the guidance include people needing to travel to provide care to others. “In other words, people can go out to volunteer if they are providing help to vulnerable people or if their volunteering cannot be done from home.” If you are deemed high risk – you are aged over 70 or have underlying health issues – there are volunteering opportunities that you can do by phone or computer from home.Be sensible and vigilant. If you are helping out neighbours, please remember physical distancing rules: try to communicate by phone or text don’t enter people’s houses and always stay at least two metres away. Look after yourself, don’t go on an errand for a neighbour if you are ill or self-isolating. Wash your hands regularly.There are inescapable health risks from face-to-face volunteering and no guarantees that you will have adequate personal protective equipment. For this reason many voluntary projects, such as community kitchens and day centres, have shut down services. However, others are adapting to try to minimise the risks of infection through physical contact or close proximity. Some face-to-face befriending services, for example, have been replaced by phone or online alternatives.Yes. Charities both small and large have been devastated by the sudden drop in voluntary income caused by the cancellation or postponement of fundraising gatherings, ranging from fetes and coffee mornings to the London marathon. Those with high street retail outlets have also been hit by shop closures. UK charities estimate they will lose over £4bn over the next few weeks. Without cash, thousands of charities, including hospices, health and social care, and cancer support charities will be forced to reduce services, or in some cases even close down.The immediate focus is on charities that can provide emergency frontline support to vulnerable people affected by the social impact of coronavirus, including food banks and care organisations helping older, isolated and disabled people and their families. There are more than 14 million people living on the breadline in the UK, and they will be badly hit by the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Other organisations that need help include those providing welfare advice and emotional and respite support.One of the safest ways of giving is to donate to the National Emergencies Trust. This charity is co-ordinating the UK coronavirus disaster voluntary relief effort, providing a single online portal for donations from iniduals and companies. The money will be rapidly distributed in the form of small grants to recognised local charities via 46 established regional community foundations covering the whole of the UK.

Silverstone and F1 have issued a joint statement acknowledging that while other major events set for this summer have already been called off, the grand prix – scheduled for 19 July – was not under any logistical pressure to do so immediately.Eight Formula One meetings have been postponed or cancelled this season because of the coronavirus pandemic but the British Grand Prix remains on the calendar. With the UK still under lockdown Wimbledon, due to start on 29 June, is expected to be the next major event to fall. The Tokyo Olympics, Euro 2020 and the French Open tennis tournament have already been postponed and The Open on 16-19 July at Royal St George’s is also under threat.According to the British Grand Prix’s organisers, however, the race remains viable for the moment. Their statement read: “Silverstone and Formula One remain in close dialogue regarding the ongoing situation and are assessing the feasibility of holding the British Grand Prix on 17-19 July.“We fully appreciate that other UK sporting events in July have taken decisions regarding their events, but it is important to highlight that their logistics and sporting arrangements differ from Silverstone’s and, therefore, our timeline gives us until the end of April to make a final decision. The safety of our fans, colleagues and the F1 community will be our priority and we will continue to engage with the appropriate authorities.”Last week Stuart Pringle, the circuit’s managing director, warned that if the UK’s lockdown, currently set to end on 13 April, was extended it would make preparations for the grand prix difficult. However the statement suggests both F1 and Silverstone are willing to delay their decision should restrictions continue until the end of April. Building the infrastructure around the circuit is crucial with Pringle noting that 12 weeks was required to do so.As things stand the first race that can be held this season is the Canadian GP on 14 June, although current restrictions on entry to the country mean that too is unlikely to take place. Organisers have said they will make a decision by Easter weekend (11-12 April).F1 is still hopeful of finding new dates for cancelled races, targeting a total of 15-18 for the season. On Tuesday the FIA confirmed the teams have waived their rights to be consulted on the rescheduling of the calendar and agreed the season could run into January 2021 if necessary. A minimum of eight meetings are required to constitute a world championship.Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Racing Point, the team owned by the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, will race as Aston Martin next season.

Certainly I’ve never experienced anything like it and don’t think anyone else has. If there’s an opportunity to play as much cricket as we can, I’d like to think every player would be behind it. I certainly am.”However, Morgan sounded a note of caution saying: “Obviously times are still uncertain at the moment. People are waiting to see what sort of impact that has had on the virus and if it has slowed things down or stopped the increase in infection.“Realistically we can’t think about playing, when our first game will be, or how many we will play until the situation is downgraded from a pandemic. As ridiculous as it sounds that’s how serious it is.”During his time in lockdown, Morgan has been adjusting to life as a parent after his wife gave birth to their first child last month. The Irishman said: “We’ve been isolated for a bit longer than anyone else, which is really nice.“We’ve been dealt a really good hand when it comes to things that are going on at the moment and have been bunkered away for a while, and haven’t been under pressure to go off and play cricket, which has been really nice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfc7df46df365dbee9a06a2de008089b4c4704e/0_191_4290_2572/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8119c0a85cec9e333b2956e525110cb5","title":"my favourite game graham gooch v india lords 1990","story":"On that day, when Test triple hundreds were still extremely rare, it felt as if we were watching history in the makingI was 17. The end of the summer term had been dominated by Italia 90 and Friday nights dabbling in snakebite and black. I had little idea what I was doing with my life, apart from extra shifts behind the bread counter at Sainsbury’s and getting down to the business of failing my first driving test, thanks to Guildford’s dystopian Stoke roundabout.Meanwhile cricket rumbled on. Following England had become quite the cathartic wallow. Since the dazzle of the 1985 Ashes, their performances had limped from unfortunate to woeful. They had won only two series – an Ashes away romp in 1986-87 and a one-off Test against Sri Lanka.The nadir had come the summer before, when the selectors had shelled 29 players during the 4-0 Ashes thrashing and the side had been decimated by a rebel tour to South Africa. That winter, out of favour or pushing stout, David Gower and Ian Botham were left out of the touring party. Cricket was teetering into irrelevance.The early visitors that 1990 summer had been New Zealand, a series overshadowed almost entirely by the World Cup – though Michael Atherton did make a maiden Test century. But the hosepipe ban months smouldered on and India arrived, led by the (pre-disgrace) Mohammad Azharuddin and including the young Sachin Tendulkar.My dad had secured tickets for the Friday of the first Test, at Lord’s, and off we trundled on the train with my brothers, meeting a couple of uncles and cousins in the queue. Graham Gooch, skipper since the disastrous summer of the four captains, was 194 not out overnight and we speculated, over doughnuts, as to whether he could make it to 200.We didn’t have to wait long. His casual acknowledgement seeped into the mood and the early part of the first session passed in fairly relaxed style, with Gooch and Allan Lamb palming off India’s bowling as people mooched through their broadsheets. But as he reached 250, collective ears pricked up. On he went, past Wally Hammond’s 251, Glenn Turner’s 259, through the 260s, overtaking Graeme Pollock and Zaheer Abbas on 274, past Compton, May, Richards IVA, and Bradman, again, to reach, after a hiccup of hesitation, a triple hundred, which brought with it the outrageous gesture of removing his helmet.Twitter would have had a field day but in the analogue age all the work was done by the knowledge of the crowd itself and TMS, who knew the beauty of a slow burn through a Walkman, and allowed the excitement to bubble and foam.The glut of Test triple hundreds was yet to come, no one had passed 300 since Lawrence Rowe in 1974. Gary Sobers had held the highest Test score since 1958, his 365 a stat imprinted on every fan’s mind. As Gooch inched towards it, the crowd’s nerves showed not in bedlam, but skittish silence, superstitions bloomed and even the champagne corks knew their place.All those training runs round Chelmsford had done their job as Gooch ploughed on, a most unlikely record breaker in his white cycle helmet, his short-sleeved shirt and droopy moustache. But with Bradman’s 334 and Wally Hammond’s 336 in spitting distance, he got an inside edge from a tired drive and was bowled. After 10 and a half hours he trudged modestly off, the crowd let out a collective sigh, and he was gone, applauded through the wicker gate and right up though the Long Room.The collective joy of having been there and the wonder of English cricket having a tiny moment in the sun lasted a long time and to those of us who had watched on television the fall of the Berlin Wall the previous winter it felt like we, too, had witnessed our own little bit of history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c57efb5699635f3522a2ebc05ed3463d8005179/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86e944789ef85164ebe345c5a6ba084a","title":"uka urged to gift tokyo anniversary games to ease tension with west ham","story":"UK Athletics can end its spat with West Ham United over whether the Premier League club can stage the Anniversary Games at the London Stadium in July by gifting this year’s event to Tokyo free of charge instead, says the UKA’s former chair.Ed Warner, who led UK Athletics from 2007 to 2017, said his “radical” proposal would not only save millions of pounds that could be erted towards fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, but would also be seen as a “gift from London to sports fans around the world”.The war of words between UKA and West Ham over what will happen to the London Stadium if the football season has resumed by July has become increasingly heated with West Ham rejecting calls from UKA’s chief executive, Joanna Coates, to waive tenancy rights so the stadium can be reconfigured to stage the Anniversary Games on 4-5 July.While the contracts that UKA and West Ham hold with the London Legacy Development Corporation call for an element of “reasonableness”, West Ham made it clear this week that when the Premier League resumes the London Stadium will be configured for football “and not inappropriately set up for an athletics meeting or a concert”.With no end to the impasse in sight, and UKA facing a crippling financial blow if its flagship event is not staged, Warner has urged both sides to think laterally and creatively and send a goodwill measure to the Olympic host city that has seen its Games postponed for 12 months.“The ill-advised cost-saving exercise when the stadium was revamped after the London 2012 Games means that reconfiguring the seating takes around two weeks,” Warner said. “This is a hugely labour-intensive exercise reported to cost up to a staggering £8m a time, and social distancing guidelines militate against a nonessential project like the stadium seat move.“Tokyo should be encouraged to revert to the Anniversary Games’ original structure and add a third day of elite Para athletics, so creating the tastiest of appetisers for both next year’s Olympics and Paralympics.”Warner, writing on the iSportConnect website, said he was convinced that the World Athletics president, Seb Coe, would recognise the value of the switch. He also believed the BBC, UKA’s broadcast partner, would be delighted with an event likely to pull in an audience of “maybe five or 10 times its usual two million viewers”, while Müller, the headline commercial partner, “would receive unimagined global exposure”.“The Legacy Company would save the exorbitant costs of moving the London Stadium’s seats, more than enough to make a payment equal to the average profit UKA made from the event in recent years,” Warner said. “This would shore up the governing body’s fragile finances and remove the virus uncertainty hanging over it. The mayor’s remaining saving – perhaps as much as £5m – could be committed to a fighting fund for community sports clubs in Newham and the other London Olympic boroughs to help them weather the effects of the pandemic.“West Ham, given a clear run at completing their season at home, should be encouraged to top up this fighting fund, or instead commit additional resources to the excellent community work already undertaken by the club’s charitable foundation.”Warner said that such an event would also help Tokyo prepare for next summer’s Olympics. “A two- or three-day Diamond League event in its shiny new National Stadium would prove the hottest ticket anywhere in the world this year and a guaranteed money-spinner. Has there ever been a better test event for an Olympic venue?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9475d7c1406be31fb6442fe5a7256f8bbce92b06/0_14_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e373b0d9dea9230ca6defb8094ed1c1b","title":"cabin fever agenda for housebound olympics","story":"Amateur pastimes provide fair entertainment when the alternative is staring at the wall or, worse, watching the newsIf you know one thing about CB Fry, it’s that he was a man of many talents. He made a Test century against Australia, tied the world long‑jump record, took a five-wicket haul at Lord’s, won a cap for England at right-back, started an FA Cup final for Southampton and played three games on the wing for the Barbarians.His CV reads like a schoolboy’s daydream. But there is nothing in it quite so unlikely as his ability to make a standing leap on to a mantelpiece. Fry is the man who declined the throne of Albania and tried to forestall the war by teaching the Nazis to play cricket but, when all is said and done, that party trick was his pièce de résistance.According to Fry’s biographer, Wallis Myers, Fry would “face the mantelpiece, crouch down, take a leap upwards, turn in the air, and bow to the ‘gallery’ with his feet planted on the shelf”. The way Myers tells it, “persuasion would occasionally get him to perform this ‘turn’ at country houses, much to the interest of guests”. Others who knew Fry say he didn’t need all that much persuading.Years later the playwright Ben Travers recalled that Fry, in a fit of enthusiastic reminiscence, had to be talked out of demonstrating it in the library at Lord’s. He was in his mid-70s at the time.I was thinking about it the other day, when, in the first stirrings of cabin fever, I found myself eyeing the living room mantelpiece like it was some distant mountain, 110cm tall, with a scented candle, a clock, and a picture of the kids on top. A domestic Everest. “Challenge is what makes men,” said Edmund Hillary, 20 years after he had become the first person to make the summit. “When men stop looking for challenges, we human beings will be in a very bad way.”Hillary would be heartened to know that even in the thick of the lockdown people haven’t quit yet. New challenges abound, even within these four walls.Here’s Pan Shancu, running an ultra-marathon around two dining tables in his living room in Hangzhou, 6,250 laps, or 50km, in 4hr 48min 44sec. “I have not been outside for many days, today I cannot bear sitting down any more,” he explained. And Elisha Nochomovitz, who swapped the Barcelona marathon for a run back and forth along the seven-metre strip of balcony outside his flat in Toulouse. “I needed to assure myself I could still run 40km.” He finished in 6hr 48min and said his neighbours were “very understanding” about the sound of his feet pounding up and down.And James Page from Sidcup, who just completed his in 873 50-metre laps of his back garden. “I’ve trodden down all the grass, from out the window you can see a perfect trek of the loop I was running,” he said. “My wife’s not too happy.”There is sport to be found in the most unlikely places. Like the viral clips of the two men playing paddle tennis between their neighbouring windows on the fourth floor of their apartment block (their rally lasted 28 shots) and the pair playing ping pong with frying pans and a net made out of pasta boxes. Or Ian Bell lacing a bog roll down the corridor for four (“Don’t bowl there, son,” he tells his kid) or Lionel Messi doing keepie-uppies with one (which brought to mind Michel Platini’s line: “What Zidane does with a ball, Maradona could do with an orange.”).There is a whole world of this nonsense out there to revel in and the beginnings of a roster of desperate events for a housebound Olympics to fill the gap left by Tokyo 2020. There are new sports waiting to be invented, new heroes to be discovered.Heroes such as Silvio Sabba, who holds 234 Guinness world records. Many of them seem eminently breakable until you try. Among them, the tallest toilet roll tower built in 30 seconds (28 rolls), and the greatest number of eggs held in one hand, palm down (eight), the most pairs of underpants put on in 30 seconds (16), the most uncooked grains of rice moved with chopsticks in one minute (38), the tallest tower made out of Ferrero Rocher stacked on top of each other (12), the most sugar cubes balanced on the chin (17), and most coins stacked in one minute (69).Sabba also holds the world records for the highest standing jump made on one leg (1.364m) and the highest standing jump on to a balance board (1.213m). He apparently considers that last one his masterpiece, but then he hasn’t yet attempted a standing leap on to a mantelpiece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56b3b1b2654e92a94268fd1b271c98fc41e8f644/0_318_3082_1848/master/3082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5680a7c9a0d7ebdd90257a60fb8f06f","title":"reading shakespeare book plays emma smith","story":"With theatres closed, now is the time to find pleasure in Shakespeare’s texts. His first fans used them for chat-up lines – and read the plays without the baggage of BardolatryThat Shakespeare wrote for the theatre and that his plays should be enjoyed on the stage not the page has become the standard rallying cry of directors, teachers and academics. “I don’t think people should bother to read Shakespeare. They should see him in the theatre,” Sir Ian McKellen advised in 2015. And if actors bring Shakespeare to life, according to Royal Shakespeare Company director Greg Doran, the benefits are mutual: advocating a “Shakespeare gym” earlier this year, Doran suggested that without proper opportunity to perform Shakespeare, the craft of acting itself could “diminish or get lost”.But this is a modern perspective. Powerful advocates for Shakespeare in the past were less convinced by the medium of theatre. Samuel Johnson, the great 18th-century lexicographer and editor of the plays, felt that while comedy was often better experienced in the theatre, tragedy rarely was. Charles Lamb, who with his sister Mary wrote the popular children’s Tales from Shakespeare, suggested that “the plays of Shakespeare are less calculated for performance on a stage than those of almost any other dramatist whatever”. When we watch King Lear, he suggested, we see merely the mundanely pitiful “old man tottering about the stage with a walking-stick”, but when “we read it, we see not Lear but we are Lear”. Deep engagement with the plays meant private study, not public spectacle.This Titus reader was certainly not in awe of Shakespeare – and perhaps hadn’t even heard of him: the play, like the others printed over the next four years, was issued anonymously. But by the end of the decade, 13 other plays had been printed, in more than 20 separate editions. These playbooks often advertised their origins in performance – the first edition of Romeo and Juliet has as a blurb “often (with great applause) played publicly” – but they clearly also established their place in the print marketplace. Gradually, some of the apparatus we now take for granted in a printed play began to be more standardised, and playbooks offered lists of characters and more descriptive stage directions to aid readers. Title pages frequently claimed that the texts were “newly corrected and augmented”: the second edition of Hamlet told buyers that it was “enlarged to almost as much again as it was”. More was definitely more when it came to Shakespeare’s readers.That doesn’t mean that early readers necessarily slogged through entire plays from start to finish. Copies of the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays, the First Folio of 1623, often show great enthusiasm at the start of the volume, which tails off with readers’ best intentions. Ideas of reading in this period were, in any case, less immersive and more strategic. The educated reader harvested from the play useful or exemplary phrases with which to enhance their own writing, marking them in the margin of the book with a symbol or line. This activity of commonplacing cherrypicked from literary texts in order to create reusable fragments. Reading was effectively a stage in verbal recycling.In some ways this anticipates our own culture of Shakespeare quotations, but with one major difference. For us, the mark of the quotation is its utter distinctiveness. Early modern readers were looking for something that was a bit more adaptable to their own context. No one seems to have had much everyday use for now-famous highlights such as “To be or not to be”, or “A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse”, whereas flowery phrases for use in letter-writing in Love’s Labour’s Lost are frequently commonplaced. One copy of The Tempest marked by an early reader does not seem to notice Prospero’s lyrical: “Our revels now are ended”, but is deeply impressed by Ferdinand’s cheesy chat-up lines to the unworldly Miranda: “Tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night.” Early modern readers of Shakespeare felt no embarrassment about taking from the plays what they wanted, and no obligation to the author’s larger intention.Perhaps we could recover that liberated form of reading as we return to the plays on the page while the theatres are dark. Early modern readers encountered Shakespeare’s plays without the cultural baggage of centuries of Bardolatry. I like the simple pathos of one early woman reader, Frances Wolfreston who lived near Tamworth, who wrote on her copy of Othello: “a sad one”. Shakespeare’s first readers engaged in acts of rewriting where they felt the original was lacking or could be improved. They took from their reading the aspects that were most relevant to their own lives, or the phrases they felt they might be able to use or imitate in their own writing. They enjoyed the texture of verbal detail rather than an overall narrative arc. Although we know that many early readers of Shakespeare were also enthusiastic playgoers, they found that the pleasures of reading were distinct from those of the theatre. Maybe we can too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c294fb023f85d77cd45195ebd100b5a573d3d51/82_150_3278_1968/master/3278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6f2dd2fefaf1cca7c63d4e66d6e4d64","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon• Coronavirus and culture – a list of major cancellations• Coronavirus – latest updates• See all our coronavirus coverageMike Bartlett’s acclaimed 2016 play Wild, a whistleblower thriller inspired by the Edward Snowden case, is the first of three Hampstead theatre productions to be streamed on the.

Choose yours wisely, says sleep expert Dr Rangan Chatterjee Do you wake up with an aching back? With pain in your neck? Or an acute need for high-strength coffee? How you feel the second your alarm goes off tells you legions about how well you slept. And the underlying cause of your sleep issues could be literally lying under you: your mattress is the foundation to a good night’s rest.“One of the big problems with sleep is that we underestimate the importance of getting eight quality hours,” says Dr Rangan Chatterjee, M\u0026ampS sleep ambassador and author of The Stress Solution. “Once you prioritise your sleep, it automatically improves.” Sleep is fundamental to how we feel in the day. If you look in the brain after a bad night’s sleep, says Chatterjee, “you see a collapse in memory, attention, cognitive function, decision-making capacity and the ability to learn new things.” And an increased likelihood of exploding when there’s an unexpected item in the bagging area at the supermarket, because a bad night’s sleep is synonymous with a bad mood.Admittedly, we all have a few big nights out and accidental midnight Netflix binges, but sometimes we’re unable to sleep well through the night at no fault of our own. And a common culprit? That old mattress you’ve been making do with. “When your mattress is so comfortable that you can’t wait to get into bed in the evening, you send a powerful message to your body and brain,” says Chatterjee. Think of finding the right mattress as an act of self-care, up there with going to yoga or cooking a healthy dinner.Waking up covered in sweat isn’t necessarily a symptom of nightmares. The answer is more practical than that, says Chatterjee: “Being physically hot at night will wake you up. Being cool is critical to good sleep, so keep your bedroom at a cool, well-ventilated 17C.” If keeping the window open isn’t an option, or you’re still overheating, treat yourself to a cooling mattress topper or a luxury mattress with thermoregulating properties.If you often wake up feeling stiff, a memory foam mattress can feel like a miracle. The material is also supportive if you’re tossing and turning, or you have joint problems. “For some people, memory foam can be absolutely life-changing,” says Chatterjee. “The material adapts to your weight and body shape, so it’s very personalised.” As your body sinks into the mattress, you may even feel your spine start to stretch out. It’s the restorative antidote to hunching over a desk during the day.So how do you know you’ve found the right mattress? Simple, says Chatterjee: “When you lie down and you don’t want to get up.” Sweet dreams.The natural option: Made using cashmere, silk, pashmina, lambswool and cotton, the Natural Plus 1500 Medium mattress (from £499) is a pocket spring mattress with an enhanced natural and supportive feel.The M\u0026ampS Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night’s sleep.

The secret to a good night lies in your evening routine, says  Alexandra Jones“We all have our own unique relationship with sleep, but two things are true for all of us: to sleep soundly we need to feel safe and settled in our environment,” says sleep therapist Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Fast Asleep, Wide Awake. The solution is multi-sensory. “Creating a pre-bedtime ritual, incorporating visual, physical or olfactory cues can be a good way to foster those feelings,” she says. “So my most important tip is to find a routine that helps you to drift off and to stick to it.”And it’s not just about the 20 minutes before bedtime. “From the moment you step through the door in the evening, start making the transition from the busyness of the day to a relaxed state that’s ready for sleep,” says Ramlakhan. “There are a few small tricks that can be incorporated into anyone’s evening, no matter how busy.”But where do you start? “Lighting is paramount,” says Ramlakhan. The hormone melatonin is responsible for making us fall asleep the pineal gland in our brain naturally starts to release more melatonin into the bloodstream at night. However, bright lights, especially screen light, can delay the production of melatonin by stimulating a nerve pathway connecting the retina in the eye to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. “Candles are a good option if you don’t want to delay the onset of melatonin release,” says Ramlakhan. She recommends two hours of low light, giving the brain plenty of time to start pumping the sleep hormone into the system. Opt for the Calm Candle, £7.50, which releases a gentle fragrance mix of clary sage, lavender and sweet orange – formulated to promote relaxation.In fact, lavender has long been used as a natural sedative as far back as the 14th century, Charles VI, king of France, is said to have demanded that lavender be stuffed into his pillows to help him sleep.“My own bedroom is scented with lavender,” says Ramlakhan. Over the past 10 years, several studies have found that, neurologically, the smell of lavender oil has anti-anxiety and analgesic properties. “The scientific benefits of aromatherapy interventions are still being understood, but incorporating them into our night-time routine can make us feel calm from the associations we have with the smell.” As well as lavender, Ramlakhan uses eucalyptus because, as she explains: “It was used in my childhood a lot – and that memory makes it a potent relaxant for me. Adding something with a strong aromatherapeutic smell into your night-time routine can act like a trigger, telling your brain that it’s time for sleep.”When you’re sleeping away from home, bring your bedtime routine with you to reduce the unsettling feeling. So, if lavender is part of your night-time ritual, says Ramlakhan, “the associated behaviour and smell is likely to help you relax and create feelings of safety.” Ren Pillow Spray, £19, is blended with essential oils, including lavender.Alternatively, switching your regular shower gel to something like L’Occitane Aromachologie Relaxing Shower Gel, £16.50, could work just as well. It has a blend of essential oils that infuse the steam with a relaxing scent. “And if you’ve got time for a bath in the evening, salts are a great way to relax tired muscles,” says Ramlakhan. As well as washing away tension, This Works Deep Sleep Bath Soak, £22, smells ine and will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated.The trick is not to leave showering or bathing too late. Like light, body temperature plays an important role in preparation for the night the process of rapid cooling after a hot shower is proven to aid sleep, but it takes about 90 minutes to reach peak drowsiness.

He told the Senate on Wednesday: “We must not confuse the first positive signals with an ‘all clear’ signal. Data shows that we are on the right path and that the drastic decisions are bearing fruit.”Although data has shown that the total number of cases in the country is slowing – with 4,053 new infections on Tuesday – the death toll remains at over 800 a day.Spain has crossed the threshold of 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, health officials said on Wednesday. According to official figures, it has more cases than any country except Italy and the US. Spain also reached a record single-day death toll between Tuesday and Wednesday, with a total of 864 deaths. The country has logged 102,136 cases of the virus and 9,053 deaths.Russia has dispatched a cargo plane with masks and medical equipment to the US after Donald Trump accepted an offer of humanitarian aid from Vladimir Putin to fight the coronavirus outbreak. The delivery is likely to stir controversy among critics of Trump, who have said Putin will portray the goodwill gesture as a public relations coup and use it to bolster Russia’s efforts to escape sanctions for meddling in the 2016 US elections.The UK government is aiming to test 25,000 a day for Covid-19 within a fortnight, the housing minister has said. Downing Street is facing mounting criticism over a lack of testing compared with other nations, with only 143,186 carried out to date. By comparison, Germany is testing 70,000 a day.The UK’s Covid-19 death toll jumped 381 in a single day on Tuesday, with overall fatalities standing at 1,789. More than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus.The UK health secretary has ordered all spare coronavirus tests to be used for NHS workers, as it emerged only a small proportion of those in isolation appear to really be ill with the virus.Data collected by Johns Hopkins University researchers shows at least 43,291 people have died around the world. At least 874,000 have been infected.The White House has said 240,000 people could die of Covid-19 in the US. Models indicate at least 100,000 will die. Donald Trump said the country should expect a “very, very painful two weeks”. US deaths currently exceed those in China. Monday was the deadliest day yet for the US, which has now lost more than 4,076 people.A British national is among four people to have died on the coronavirus-stricken Zaandam cruise ship embroiled in a bitter dispute over plans to disembark passengers in the US, the PA Media news agency reports.China reported 36 new Covid-19 cases and 130 new asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of such cases under observation to 1,367. Previously, China has regarded asymptomatic patients as a low risk and not included them in their tally of confirmed cases. The move to disclose the number of asymptomatic cases comes amid scrutiny of China’s reported figures, which previously only included people who exhibited symptoms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area covid 19","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.However, official guidance sent to local authorities seen by the  reveals that the government anticipates that no more than 400,000 people self-isolating in their homes would sign up for free food parcels over the next few weeks, with the rest expected to turn it down because they have support from family and friends.Separately, food banks have warned that potentially hundreds of thousands of older and vulnerable people who do not qualify for help through the emergency delivery scheme, but who are self-isolating at home, are now reliant on over-stretched food charities’ supplies to access food safely.Sonya Johnson, chief executive of Nuneaton and Bedworth Healthy Living Network, a community charity which operates a food bank, said it had been approached by unprecedented numbers of older people who did not qualify for government help but were struggling to put food on the table.She said: “The official scheme identifies those most at risk of ending up in hospital. But there are probably four times as many who are just on the other side of that fine line or who have undiagnosed conditions. We have older people saying to us: ‘I haven’t eaten for a couple of days because I don’t have any food in’.”The guidance, issued to councils and local resilience teams by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) last week, said: “The food industry can deliver 50k parcels to the doorstep in week 1, 150k parcels in week 2 and 350k parcels in week 3, rising to over 400k in week 4 should this be required.”It adds: “However… we would expect that a large number of people identified as medically vulnerable will have some form of social network around them who can help to support them throughout their period of shielding (and will not need to take up the offer outlined here).”Some councils have complained that the supplies they have received for food parcels – which are intended to provide a week’s food for one person – are nutritionally limited, and have not come in sufficient quantities to meet demand.Rochdale council said it was sent parcels for 44 people on Monday, though it had identified 129 people who needed emergency food aid. The supply was mostly made up of empty calories and included a giant bottle of sweetened fruit squash, a bag of sugar, teabags, confectionery, small gingerbread biscuits, egg noodles, catering-sized packs of Angel Delight dessert mix, and one apple per person.Inventories seen by the  of what was delivered to some other councils over the last few days list similar items of very low nutritional value, including tins of creamed rice, sweetened custard, and long-life “one meal” portions of ready meals such as sausages and mash.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.One council said that the only fresh fruit or vegetables on the list of what would be supplied to them was a limited number of apples, but these did not in fact get delivered. Another local government source said they were concerned a shipment of food heading to Newcastle included just Angel Delight, porridge and a catering-sized pack of instant noodles.The government claims initial calls were made to wholesalers as the coronavirus outbreak unfolded to ask them what products they had in surplus. Some of those were distributed by MHCLG to councils, so they could stockpile some goods, but they were not intended to make up the entire contents of a food parcel.The MHCLG said Public Health England had given them guidance on the nutritional value of the boxes. Referring to food items sent out in Rochdale, a government spokesperson said: “This picture is misleading, it is not one of the food boxes we are delivering directly to the homes of extremely medically vulnerable people.“Our food boxes are of a standard that is consistent and include cereal, fruit and vegetables and pasta. As much as possible, this is a package that is universally suitable, and will provide enough food for one person for one week. Councils have been issued with some additional supplies to help kickstart their wider efforts – but these should not be confused for a food box.”The guidance to councils, issued last week, said that packages would not contain perishable food, such as fruit and vegetables, although it seems that in some cases these instructions have been superseded, with evidence that boxes have been issued that include apples, oranges and potatoes.The guidance warns that the “one size fits all” packages cannot be modified to take into account inidual medical, dietary or religious requirements, raising concerns that they will not meet the nutritional needs of people with medical conditions such as cancer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e234481f0dfc3d4d670deb214653ed8e770781/0_2_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f060b6affae4f43aa7f1e40d57b3de9","title":"golden eagles us dying why","story":"Golden eagles are one of the most protected species in the US – so what happens when one turns up dead in a field?One morning toward the end of January 2019, Steve Lewis, a US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biologist in Juneau, Alaska, logged on to the website Movebank.org to check the whereabouts of some golden eagles that he had tagged with GPS trackers.Lewis, a lanky, outdoorsy 49-year-old, usually tried to look at the location data once a week, but he had spent most of the month at home on furlough, unable to work as a result of the government shutdown. Eager to catch up with his birds, Lewis beelined it to his office when he got back to work. “The first thing I did,” he says, “was go and check on my eagle tags.”One bird in particular, Golden Eagle 1703, gave him pause. Lewis knew the animal well. He had tagged it on 26 July 2017, when it was still a nestling on a rocky outcrop in Denali national park and preserve. Even before it knew how to fly, 1703 displayed its might by leaping from its nest and gliding a quarter mile down a valley to evade Lewis’s initial attempt at tagging it. After a short hike, Lewis and his team retrieved the squawking bundle of black and white feathers, outfitted it with the tracking device, and returned it safely to its nest.In the 18 months that followed, 1703 flourished. The bird traversed about 8,000 miles, from Denali to Wyoming, all the way back up to Alaska’s North Slope, where it probably feasted on waterfowl and perhaps a straggling caribou calve of two. From there, it carved a long, treacherous path south through the wilderness of western Canada and worked its way back to the lower 48 to hunker down for its second winter on Earth.Little is known about what golden eagles do in the liminal years between leaving their parents’ nest and settling down to build a nest of their own. Each ping from 1703’s solar-powered GPS revealed a tiny part of the picture, offering a rare glimpse of an apex predator as it learned the ropes of the natural world. “It takes four or five years for them to reach maturity,” Lewis says, “and it’s unknown how long it actually takes them to then compete and get into the breeding population. So you have to follow a bird for years.”But now, staring at his computer screen on that January morning, Lewis could see that 1703’s location device was stationary in Sully county, South Dakota, and had been so for two days. “It was seeing the sun and talking to the satellites,” Lewis says, “but it wasn’t moving.”It’s not uncommon for Lewis to lose a bird. Since 2014, he, along with colleagues from the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, have tagged 49 golden eagles in Alaska as part of a broader effort to understand their biology, behavior and population trends. Of those birds, only 17 are still being monitored. Sometimes the GPS device malfunctions or the eagle shakes free from it. Other times the bird dies.“It’s a tough world out there,” Lewis tells me, “especially for eagles.” They can starve to death or get electrocuted by high wires or be decapitated by wind turbines. None of those fates, however, seemed likely in the rolling farmland of Sully county.Hoping to get a sense of what went wrong, Lewis opened a souped-up version of Google Earth, plugged in the last GPS coordinates he had for 1703, and began looking around the virtual landscape. There was a nearby road, a line of trees, acres of empty land, and what looked to be a farmhouse. “It definitely felt suspicious,” Lewis says.He called up a Fish and Wildlife office in Pierre, South Dakota, and asked if anyone could go check on a downed eagle tag.Richard Bare wasn’t sure whether to be pissed off or deeply disappointed by the prospect of having to retrieve yet another dead eagle. “I first and foremost suspected a shooting because we were having a rash of eagle shootings,” says Bare, a special agent with FWS’s office of law enforcement, who was stationed in South Dakota at the time. In the five weeks leading up to 1703’s death, he had responded to a bald eagle shooting and two separate golden eagle shootings. None of the birds survived, and he found no evidence to suggest the incidents were related. The case of 1703 seemed like more of the same.While the average American might be shocked to learn of an eagle being intentionally blasted from the sky, those who work in wildlife law enforcement know it’s an alarmingly common problem. According to one FWS report, somewhere in the range of 1,000 golden eagles are shot each year. Sometimes it’s poachers who want to sell the bird’s feathers on the black market, other times it’s ranchers who want to keep the e-bombing predators from snatching their livestock.Bare, who has been a special agent since 2016 and before that spent close to a decade in the field as an FWS game warden (the outdoor world’s equivalent of a beat cop) ballparks that over the course of his career he’s dealt with upwards of 200 cases involving eagles – shootings, poisonings, collisions with cars, starvations. “If you asked me about any other eagle, I probably wouldn’t remember it,” he says. But 1703 “was a flashbulb event” because the weather was memorably miserable, even by South Dakota standards. A punishing cold snap had plunged temperatures well below zero while sustained winds of 50mph ripped across the plains.After a quick chat with Lewis, Bare loaded his cold-weather gear into his truck and hit the road. 1703’s GPS tracker was pinging about five miles north-west of where the Oahe Dam cuts across the Missouri River to form Lake Oahe, one of the nation’s largest man-made reservoirs and fertile hunting ground for birds of prey.When Bare arrived at the location, he saw all the same features that had popped up on Lewis’s computer screen – the quiet country road, the shelter belt of trees and the farmhouse, which in real life was dilapidated and long ago abandoned. A firm layer of snow crunched under his boots as he walked across the field, scanning the ground for any signs of an eagle or an errant GPS tag. Then, among the knee-high wheat reeds that poked through the frozen landscape, Bare spotted what looked to be a clump of tail feathers. He took out his camera and began documenting everything. “Even though something might not be a criminal investigation, I have to treat it as such and maintain the integrity of the evidence,” he says, “the evidence being the eagle in this case.”Only two species of eagles are native to the US – the bald eagle and the golden eagle – and few animals in the world enjoy as many legal protections as they do. In addition to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacy Act, which regulates the trade of wildlife, they are privy to the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a federal statute that threatens steep fines and jail time for anyone caught killing eagles, disrupting their nests, or generally interfering with the birds.Passed in 1940, the law was originally designed to protect only bald eagles. At the time, the species was teetering on the edge of extinction in the contiguous US as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the toxic effects of DDT. In 1962, Congress amended the act to include golden eagles. Nearly 50 years later, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has proven to be a godsend, at least for bald eagles. The national bird is widely considered one of the 20th century’s greatest environmental comeback stories: in 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs lived in the lower 48. Today well over 10,000 pairs can be found from the suburbs of Boston to garbage dumps near Seattle.Golden eagles haven’t been as lucky. While they are not classified as an endangered or threatened species, they certainly aren’t thriving. FWS estimates that in 1967, there were 31,813 golden eagles in the US. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the agency estimated there were 31,477 golden eagles in our skies. It’s a remarkable stretch of stability, but it’s unclear if the numbers can hold as wind farms rise across the western US and myriad pressures from habitat loss, environmental degradation and the climate crisis push down on raptors and the animals they prey upon.With so many threats looming, Bare knows as well as anyone that the last thing golden eagles need are people shooting them out of the sky. After a few minutes of photographing the area, he dug 1703’s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma – no bloody bullet hole or broken wing or spilled guts. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.A day or two later, a preliminary X-ray seemed to support his original hunch when it revealed two metal fragments near one of 1703’s wings. “It resembled the approximate diameter of buckshot,” Bare says. Following protocol, he packed 1703 on ice and FedExed it to the National Fish \u0026amp Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.Like that, 1703 had gone from a high-flying predator to commercial cargo.On any given day, a menagerie of dead animals passes through the FWS’s forensics lab. From the outside, the building looks like most any other government facility – squat, gray, plenty of parking. Inside, it’s filled with sophisticated laboratory equipment and staffed by a small, exquisitely specialized team of scientists whose disciplines range from herpetology to ornithology to ballistics to genetics. When it comes to analyzing evidence of animal-related crimes and building scientifically sound prosecutions against wildlife traffickers, poachers and others who inflict harm on nature’s inhabitants, there is no better place on earth.Like any potential murder victim, 1703 underwent a full postmortem in hopes of pinpointing the cause of death. That task fell to Rebecca Kagan, one of two staff pathologists at the lab. If there’s a federally protected animal that dies under mysterious circumstances, there’s a decent chance it will end up on Kagan’s exam table. One day it’s an endangered Mexican gray wolf the next day an eagle.“We get a lot of bald and golden eagles,” Kagan laments. In 2019, she and the other pathologist at the lab necropsied about 100 eagles total, including 1703. Managing an endless stream of suspiciously dead animals can be bleak. But Kagan keeps a sharp sense of humor – she jokes that she always carves the bird at Thanksgiving – and finds comfort in knowing that her work is ultimately in service of conservation. Sometimes a necropsy yields evidence that helps finger the bad guy. Other times her efforts reveal that there wasn’t any foul play, just the lethal hand of Mother Nature at work.Kagan unpacked 1703 on 13 February 2019, roughly three weeks after Lewis first noticed its GPS at a standstill. Dribs of a red-brown fluid leaked from the bird’s mouth when she tilted its carcass. She checked the esophagus and it was empty. She checked the crop, a pouch-like structure near the upper part of the digestive tract, and found a 3.5oz blob of partially masticated muscle and fat mixed with a few white hairs that looked like they came from a deer. “The nutritional condition was good,” Kagan recalls. “This bird didn’t starve to death.”Slowly and methodically, she worked 1703 over, inspecting and documenting every inch of its insides and outsides. A large amount of “watery, red-tinged” excrement pooled in its cloaca and its gall bladder contained “scant, yellow-green, watery bile”, according to the necropsy report.Kagan eventually arrived at the two metal pellets that showed up on the preliminary X-ray only to discover that they were nothing more than tiny remnants from the GPS harness. Hours spent deconstructing 1703, and the cause of death wasn’t any clearer. “It’s a little frustrating,” she tells me. “We really checked everything with this bird.”As a final step, she shipped 1703’s liver to Michigan State University for a detailed toxicology analysis. A few weeks later the results came back positive for bromadiolone, better known as rat poison.Even if you’ve never heard of bromadiolone or its chemical counterparts –brodifacoum difenacoum and difethialone – chances are you’ve been in close proximity to them. They are known as “second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides”, a popular class of poisons that essentially kills a rodent by making it bleed to death from the inside out. Exterminators stuff these poisons in those black plastic bait boxes that you see everywhere in cities – down alleys, on the sides of restaurants, in condo buildings’ parking lots – and they are deployed throughout the agricultural sector to keep germ-carrying rodents away from food supplies.These poisons came to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were “extremely widely embraced” from the get-go, says Bobby Corrigan, an esteemed rodentologist who has spent his career studying and consulting on pest control practices. “It was kind of a magic bullet of advanced chemistry.”Corrigan frequently preaches the importance of addressing the root causes of rodent infestations – improving trash storage and collection, addressing degrading infrastructure – and is unsettled by the widespread reliance on second-generation anticoagulants and lax enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict their use. But – and this is an important, he says – the sad truth is that we are dependent on these poisons. Forgoing them entirely would lead to an explosion in rodent populations that could usher in “a public health catastrophe”.One reason these poisons are so effective is because, in most cases, the rat or ground squirrel or vole or whatever the target vermin happens to be only needs to eat a single dose. The poison works quickly, and the critter typically doesn’t have time to excrete any of the poison before it keels over. In other words, a rat that dies from a second-generation anticoagulant often dies with a belly fully of poison. And if a scavenger comes along and plucks up the rodent corpse, it, too, will be exposed to the poison. It’s a process that scientists call bioaccumulation, and it occurs all the way up the food chain.The toxicology report for 1703 showed that it had 0.05 parts per million of bromadiolone in its liver. Murray says it’s unlikely that’s enough to directly kill an eagle, but there’s not really any good data on what the lethal threshold is for a bird of that size. If the poison didn’t deal the fatal blow, I ask, could it have impaired 1703 in a way that made the bird less capable of hunting or migrating or withstanding the winter and thus contributing to its death? Again, Murray says, it’s an important question to which there’s no answer. And even worse, it’s becoming an increasingly difficult question to study because, Murray explains, so many raptors in the wild now have rodenticide in them that it’s almost impossible to find enough birds that are free of rat poison to serve as a control group.Because of all the uncertainty around how the poisons affect birds, Kagan listed the final cause of death on 1703’s necropsy report as “undetermined (suspect poison)”. It’s a fate that many golden eagles suffer. While data is scarce, FWS scientists estimate that poisonings are now the leading cause of anthropogenic-induced death among golden eagles, possibly killing as many as 2,000 a year.Kagan’s exam table was the end of the line for 1703. Sometimes an eagle can be sent to the National Eagle Feather Repository, which distributes deceased eagles to Native American tribes so they can use the animals for ceremonial purposes. 1703 would not find any such greater meaning in death, however, because the feather repository, according to an FWS spokesperson, cannot distribute eagles exposed to rodenticides.On 7 March 2019, Kagan filed the official necropsy report and moved on to the next animal carcass in her queue.Without any evidence of a clearcut crime and an ever-expanding caseload, Bare closed the file on 1703 and retrained his focus on the spate of eagle shootings.And out in Juneau, Lewis logged 1703’s data and carried on monitoring the 17 other golden eagles that are still tagged and up in the air, hoping they avoid the wind turbines and high-voltage wires and blasts of buckshot and poisoned prey that have made the natural world so unnaturally dangerous for the species.“I know that death is a reality,” Lewis says, “but it’s really frustrating when it seems like it’s a senseless death.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf917edde114d60b274aa6ba03432a179032d230/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae5abacf8eef823f3fd898108d8a407","title":"royals ministers or even boy george houseparty isolation app coronavirus","story":"A social app once the preserve of teens is proving a vital way to beat the Coronavirus bluesLike any real-life get-together, you can never be sure who you will bump into in the kitchen – and in much the same way people are now discovering government ministers, famous musicians, and even members of the royal family when using the Houseparty app.While Zoom has quickly risen to prominence for business meetings, and Microsoft’s Teams function is being rolled out by many large firms, it is Houseparty that is becoming the place for the nation to socialise.As a result the service, which allows up to eight people to share the same chat and hop uninvited between mutual friends’ conversations, has been transformed in the space of a few weeks into a venue where the public stand a chance of inadvertently bumping into notable figures.“The great joy of Houseparty is that you can just crash any group gathering you wish,” said the magician and YouTuber Archie Manners. “I saw that a mutual friend was having a Houseparty with someone called Boy George and assumed that was someone using a nickname. I opened it up and had an hour with Mr Karma Chameleon himself. We chatted about self-isolation and music.”At least four serving cabinet ministers are on the app, including the tech-obsessed health secretary Matt Hancock, currently self-isolating with coronavirus. Keir Starmer, the frontrunner to become the next Labour leader this weekend, has also been spotted on the service, along with many Labour frontbenchers.A spokesperson for David Cameron would not comment on suggestions the former prime minister had been spotted on the service, although Labour’s one-time communications chief Peter Mandelson has an account.Real royalty has also been spotted. The Daily Mail has reported that the Duchess of Cornwall has been using Houseparty to keep in touch with her grandchildren while in self-isolation at Balmoral. The newspaper quoted a royal source saying the app was a “brilliant way of staying in touch with her own family whom she is missing terribly”.A similar pattern has been seen around the world, with usage jumping after a pandemic-enforced lockdown is imposed. Although Houseparty is owned by Epic Games, the parent company of Fortnite, it does not show any adverts and its simplicity is part of its appeal.Its growth has been boosted by the way it encourages users to upload their phonebooks and then search for contacts already on the app. This has resulted in people having Houseparty contact lists that combine real-life friends, business contacts and work colleagues in a high-risk mix. With ongoing conversations set to public by default, users are already reporting anxiety caused by ex-partners gatecrashing chats and the delicate social etiquette involved in their bosses joining late-night group conversations – although there is always the option to “lock” a room and avoid interlopers joining.Houseparty’s growing pains have brought its own problems, with a viral rumour spread earlier this week that its user data had been hacked. The service said this was a malicious smear campaign and offered $1m to anyone who could prove an attack had taken place.Its ability to break down social boundaries has been particularly appealing to many on the left of politics, with James Meadway, a former economic adviser to the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, approvingly describing it as a “chaos agent”.Tina Daheley, a BBC journalist who presents the Beyond Today podcast and many news bulletins, said she had downloaded the app last week and mainly used it to chat and play games with her friends.“On Friday I joined Houseparty and had a catchup with wine and three girlfriends, then the same on Saturday lunchtime with a couple of other friends. What’s really nice is they’re a load of my oldest schoolfriends, and realistically we don’t see each other that often but we had a proper catchup.”She’d found it harder to get her 71-year-old parents on to the service and remained mildly concerned about the prospect of her bosses being able to jump into the conversation.“The idea of an editor from BBC News accidentally joining in is terrifying,” she said.But there is one group who may be less delighted by the surge of interest in the app: its original teenage users. What was once a youth-focused space well away from adults is now overrun with middle-aged parents arranging virtual drinks parties with their friends, all suddenly able to keep an eye on what their offspring are up to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0161bbba05de1f9db2321260d44ed7b1a89d18c3/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4f1bb07a5edef0896de0fe29b254f8","title":"are you cohabiting because of coronavirus share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have unexpectedly moved in together due to the coronavirus lockdown, and from partners who’ve had to remain apart As measures to restrict the spread of coronavirus force people to stay at home, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures.Because of the short notice of the lockdown announcement, others may have had to remain at a house which isn’t their usual home, or with people they don’t usually live with.We’d like to hear from those who’ve unexpectedly moved in together, or those who have decided to remain apart.Are you living with your new in-laws?

Photograph: iStockAll 16,000 special needs assistants employed by schools are to be placed on standby to fill vacancies created by moving nurses and medical staff out of community healthcare setting and into frontline jobs.The initiative is part of a wider temporary assignment programme for public sector employees.The contingency plan for reassignments is being put in place in the event of an extension to public health measures.While all SNAs will be eligible for temporary assignment, it is likely that just a proportion will end up doing so, according to officials.,Meanwhile, the country’s largest public service trade union has said voluntary organisations which receive grant aid from the State to provide health and social services should be brought into the HSE for the duration of the crisis.Fórsa wants the Government to treat the organisations concerned - known technically as Section 39 agencies - in the same manner as it did with private hospitals earlier this week and bring them effectively under State control.The union said Section 39 organisations were independent of the HSE but depended on public money to provide disability, homelessness, addiction and other services.Health insurers are meeting the Department of Health on Wednesday on the implications arising from the agreement reached between the Government and private hospitals earlier this week.Under the initiative, the Government brought 19 private hospitals into the public health system for the duration of the current coronavirus crisis.The deal which will run for three months and potentially up to five months, will have implications for more than two million people who have private health insurance, many of whom have plans which provide cover for private hospitals.The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted this week that the new initiative did not represent the nationalisation of private hospitals but rather a partnership between public and private hospitals.On foot of the heads of agreement reached with the private hospital sector, the HSE will secure 100 per cent of available capacity including beds , theatres and diagnostic and other facilities for the duration of the deal.Health insurer Laya said in recent days it would provide financial support to its 600,000 members in response to the Covid-19 crisis.The managing director of Laya healthcare Dónal Clancy said it could not commit to the exact details of such financial support at the moment as some critical issues regarding claims costs needed to be worked out carefully.The State-owned health insurer VHI - the largest in the Irish market-- has advised subscribers that it will give back to them savings on claims generated as a result of the new measures to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.Irish Life Health indicated to its customers that they can expect a discount in the months ahead as a result of the Government’s decision to bring all private hospitals under public control during the coronavirus crisis.It has not yet indicated by how much premiums will be impacted as a result of the crisis and the reduction in the level of private health care available in the State.‘National effort’Announcing details of the SNA move on Wednesday, Minister for Education Joe McHugh said a dedicated process has been set up by the Public Appointments Service on publicjobs.ie to put such staff on standby to free up frontline workers for essential services.“SNAs do fantastic work day in day out for children with a variety of needs in our schools,” he said.“Their support hugely enriches the lives of children. Crucially, they have much-needed skills and experience which can be of huge benefit to other services and I believe will be of great support to the national effort.“I know this is a new departure for many people but opening up a temporary assignment programme is about giving some workers the opportunity to be on standby to help others in great need.”Mr McHugh said management across the education and training sector are being asked consider how best to utilise staff to facilitate the delivery of educational services.Any staff who are not required for educational or research services will be available for assignment on a temporary basis to support delivery of other essential public services.He said All SNAs will be asked to access a web link between by April 7th where they will answer a questionnaire and details will be uploaded for the temporary assignment process.Temporary assignment will be managed on a structured, centralised basis through the Department of Education and the Public Appointments Service.In the case of SNAs, the Public Appointments Service and HSE will check skills and match them with requirements before making contact with details of the reassignment role and location of work.Community Services for children with a disability have been identified as the initial priority area for temporary assignment of SNAs, including public, private and voluntary healthcare settings.SNAs may also be asked to provide remote supports to families of children who they are familiar with, including scheduled calls or video links with advice on routines, home schooling, behaviour management and social stories on Covid-19."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockRound about now, in the normal world, we would be publishing a story detailing all the “hilarious” April Fool’s Day pranks played by newspapers on their readers and brands on their customers.The story would be long and would cause readers to smile, sigh or throw their eyes to the heavens before getting on with their days.But this is not the normal world and there isn’t a lot of smiling going on. What has been striking in recent hours has been the almost total absence of April Fool’s Day jokes circulating.That is not to say there have been none.We must doff our cap to the Dublin Fire Brigade who, this morning, tweeted their thanks to Aer Lingus for the “safe delivery of specialist ‘truck mask’ PPE for our fire appliances”The post said the personal protective equipment (PPE) would “help provide fresh filtered air to the engine and cab,” and it was accompanied by a picture of a fire truck wearing a face mask, obviously.Land bridgeThe Star was one a small number of newspapers in this part of the world that tried to fool their readers. They ran with an elaborate story about a new land bridge between Holyhead and Dublin under the headline “Rocky Road to Dublin”.Well, we say the Star “tried to fool” but in truth it did not try that hard to fool anyone, given that the reporter said the € 15 billion Brexit busting bridge would be painted green white and orange and named after the Wolfe Tones.Cork-based online publication Cork Beo ran a story about the discovery of 11th century land deeds in the University of Copenhagen which had revealed that much of Cork city centre still belongs to the Nordic warrior tribes and their legal heirs.Laois Today went with a story about a new app dedicated to helping Laois people to find love.Bohemians Football Club in Dublin 7 posted a story about a Golden Eagle which has built a nest in one of the Dalymount floodlights.But apart from sporadic attempts to lift people’s spirits, the jokes were thin on the ground.Alcohol banThere was the odd WhatsApp message purporting to be from official sources suggesting that a ban on the consumption of alcohol was being introduced while some parents went to great lengths to play tricks on their children by mocking up television news reports that schools were re-opening this week.But what was clear in most quarters however was that the hearts weren’t in it this year.“When times are good and brands want to show their humour and personality, it can be positive. A good stunt can humanise a brand,” Joe Baratelli, the chief creative officer at a Los Angeles-based advertising agency told Ad Weekly. “When things are serious, it’s probably not the time to be messing with people.”It certainly isn’t but Korean pop star Kim Jaejoong clearly didn’t get that memo.In what appeared to be a serious post on Instagram, he told his 1.9 million followers that he had contracted Covid-19 and was in hospital being treated.The post was quickly deleted and then revealed to be an April Fools’ Day joke and one which was - apparently - posted in an effort to raise awareness of the pandemic.A fool for sure . . . just not perhaps an April one.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4217791.1585743786!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"seanad elections mullen tops nui poll ahead of mcdowell","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIndependent Senator Rónán Mullen (pictured with Mattie McGrath TD  in 2017) has topped the poll and been re-elected to the Seanad on the National University of Ireland (NUI) panel.

Louth Fine Gael Cllr John McGahon, nephew of the late Fine Gael TD Brendan McGahon was also elected along with Sinn Féin Senator Fintan Warfield, who retained his seat.Counting began on Tuesday on the university panels which elect three Senators each on the National University of Ireland and Trinity College panels.The Covid-19 cocooning rules resulted in registrar Dr Attracta Halpin taking over as returning officer for NUI Chancellor Maurice Manning who was forced to stay at home because he is over 70.Some 38,000 NUI graduates returned ballots, a higher turnout than in 2016 but the number of graduates rose by 12,000 to 112,206.

There, he conducted 300 tests, skipping meals to assess a stream of people so that “the country is protected from the invasion of the novel coronavirus”.Stories like this, carried in the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun, focus attention on one of the stranger oddities surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic: How could North Korea claim to not have a single coronavirus case while countries around the world stagger under the exploding epidemic?North Korea has taken some of the most drastic actions against the virus and did so sooner than most other nations. It sealed its borders in late January, shutting off business with neighboring China, which accounts for nine-tenths of its external trade. It clamped down on the smugglers who keep its thriving unofficial markets functioning. It quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. The totalitarian state’s singular ability to control the movement of people also bolsters its disease-control efforts.But decades of isolation and international sanctions have ravaged North Korea’s public health system, raising concerns that it lacks the medical supplies to fight an outbreak, which many fear has already occurred.“You can see immediately what’s going to happen if you get a surge of Covid-19 patients streaming in,” said Dr Kee B Park, a lecturer at Harvard Medical School who has worked alongside North Korean doctors to help improve the country’s health system. “It will overwhelm the system very quickly.”Many observers of North Korea doubt its claims of not having any coronavirus cases. But a lack of testing equipment may mean it literally has not detected a single case, Park said. “It’s because they may have cases but they just don’t know how to detect it,” he said. “So they can say, ‘We have not confirmed it’.”Some accuse North Korea of hiding an outbreak to preserve order. “It’s a blatant lie when they say they have no cases,” said Seo Jae-pyoung, secretary-general of the Seoul-based Association of North Korean Defectors, who said he heard from his North Korean contact that a family of three and an elderly couple died of the virus in the east coast city of Chongjin in mid-March.“The last thing the North wants is a social chaos that may erupt when North Koreans realise that people are dying of an epidemic with no cure.”Alarming reports-The North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is clearly aware of the threat the virus poses to his country’s decrepit health system. Around when Washington announced on February 13th that it would allow coronavirus-related humanitarian shipments, North Korea made a rare request for urgent help from relief groups, including diagnostic kits, according to people familiar with the matter.In recent weeks, the North’s official media outlets have carried alarming reports detailing the coronavirus’s toll around the world: a snowballing caseload in South Korea, bodies piling up in Italy, “panicked citizens” hoarding “guns and ammunition” in the United States.They contrast such reports with pictures of North Korean disease-control officials in full protective gear spraying disinfectant in buses, trams, playgrounds and hotel gyms in Pyongyang, the showcase capital city. Garment factories are shown making masks instead of clothes. There is a national drive to send eggs, meat and fish to those under quarantine.By its own account, North Korea has quarantined 10,000 people. International disease-control officials “have all been amazed” how North Korea could have done it, the state-run Rodong newspaper said this month.But video clips shot in Hyesan, a town on the North’s central border with China, in February and early March depict a far less flattering picture of the North’s disease-control efforts. A red wooden marker on a sidewalk covered with a dirty slush of ice said “disinfection station”, according to a clip, which was smuggled to the Rev Kim Seung-eun, a human rights activist in South Korea.A lone official in a green plastic suit with a tank of disinfecting liquid on his back stood idly. A silver van raced through the town blaring the importance of wearing masks. In another clip, a sign saying “Quarantined” was stuck on the door of what looked like a tenement house where Rev Kim said people with possible symptoms were kept.Information blackoutRev Kim said one of his North Korean contacts had been unable to return home for a month after visiting another town because the government controlled internal movement. Such restrictions were needed for disease control because of North Korea’s crowded public transportation network.The country’s information blackout and the inability of outside health experts to get into the country leave the rest of the world largely in the dark about how North Korea is coping with the virus. Last month, Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that hires anonymous informants inside the North, reported the deaths of 200 soldiers, as well as 23 others, who were suspected of contracting the coronavirus.But Kang Mi Jin, a North Korean defector-turned journalist in Seoul, said that no matter how hard they searched, her contacts in the North could not find a death officially ascribed to the coronavirus.In the past, the country has hushed or played down epidemics, military rebellions, man-made disasters or anything else that could undermine the people’s faith in the government. But this time, the North’s unusually aggressive moves, as well as its unique ability to detain people, may have prevented a devastating outbreak, said Jung Gwang Il, a North Korean defector who leads No Chain, a North Korean human rights activist group in Seoul.As soon as an outbreak was reported in China, North Korea rounded up all Chinese visitors in its northeastern town of Rason and quarantined them on an island for a month, Jung said.“It’s safe to say that there are cases in North Korea but I don’t think the outbreak there is as large as the ones we have seen in South Korea, Italy and the US,” said Ahn Kyung-su, the head of the Seoul-based Research Centre of DPRK Health and Welfare, which monitors the North’s health system. “North Koreans are trained to obey government orders in a shipshape way during crises. But there is the risk of the virus running out of control if it starts spreading among its malnourished people.”Ahn said testing kits from China were available in big cities such as Pyongyang. Telltale evidence came when Kim Jong-un inspected a missile test this month and military officers surrounding him did not wear masks, which Ahn said would not have happened had they not tested negative.Mass mobilisationBut the coronavirus has put Kim between a rock and a hard place, analysts say. On March 17th, the broke ground on a modern “Pyongyang General Hospital” to be completed by October. But such projects in the North rely on mass mobilisations of soldiers who sleep and eat together for months at a stretch and raise the risk of mass infections during an epidemic.By this month, some help began reaching North Korea in its efforts to confront the virus. Russia donated 1,500 test kits. China is also believed to have sent diagnostic tools. The United Nations has begun waiving sanctions for aid groups such as the Red Cross to ship testing machines and diagnostic kits, as well as ventilators and protective equipment. But the shipments have been slow.“Given the global shortage of supplies and items being available in different locations, we are still in the process of procuring the items,” said Ellie Van Baaren, a Red Cross spokeswoman. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/03/28/TELEMMGLPICT000228625840_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?im","title":"did become country happy surrender liberties","story":"Avon and Somerset Police officers chat to a dog walker in a park in BristolThe name of Pc Harold Muckle has not exactly resonated down the years yet he had a walk-on part in one of the great acts of civil disobedience against unnecessarily restrictive emergency powers. On Dec 7, 1950, the constable flagged down a car in Ballards Lane, Finchley, north London, and ordered the driver to pull into the kerb.Behind the wheel was the manager of a dry cleaning firm, one Clarence Willcock, a Yorkshireman with a deep suspicion of officialdom and a no-nonsense manner to go with it. Although he had done nothing wrong, was not driving erratically and nor was he wanted for any offence, Mr Willcock was asked by Pc Muckle to produce his identity papers. Mr Willcock refused.The date of this episode is the key. This was more than five years after the end of the Second World War, the emergency for which the carrying of ID cards was introduced in 1939.Pc Muckle issued him with a form to produce his identity card at any police station within two days which Mr Willcock threw on the pavement. He was subsequently charged under the provisions of the National Registration Act 1939. Each court found against him on the grounds that the statute remained in force and could only be reversed by an Order in Council. But sympathetic magistrates before whom he first appeared gave him an absolute discharge and the conviction was only reluctantly upheld by seven of the country’s most senior judges brought together to consider the case.Lord Goddard, the lord chief justice, said: “The police now, as a matter of routine, demand the production of national registration cards whenever they stop or interrogate a motorist for whatever cause. To demand production of the card from all and sundry, for instance from a woman who has left her car outside a shop longer than she should ... is wholly unreasonable. To use Acts of Parliament passed for particular purposes in wartime when the war is a thing of the past tends to turn law-abiding citizens into lawbreakers.”Lord Goddard added: “In this country we have always prided ourselves on the good feeling which exists between the police and the public and such action tends to make people resentful of the acts of the police and inclines them to obstruct the police instead of assisting them.” A few months later the law was repealed by the new Tory government led by Winston Churchill.I dwell upon this story because of the obvious parallels with today. For the moment, we are still in the throes of the emergency declared by the Government to deal with the coronavirus. But Lord Goddard’s strictures will become more pertinent when we move out of this phase into a more ambivalent future where some restrictions are still imposed but the immediate peril has abated.The stories of police overreach in recent days, therefore, should come as no surprise because we have had them before. The constable searching a shopping bag for frivolous items corner shops being told that Easter eggs do not qualify as essentials drivers stopped at random to justify their journeys the notorious drone sent by Derbyshire Police to spy on Peak District walkers.Since we are still in the middle of this crisis, there is remarkable popular support for what are, even by wartime standards, authoritarian measures. We are, indeed, two nations. There are those of us for whom this accretion of state power is alarming. Then there are those, evidently the majority, who will brook no criticism of any action that they think will save lives and help the NHS, such is its totemic status.Ministers have urged the police to show a sense of proportion while recognising they have a difficult task to perform. That is especially so in this country where the relationship between the police and the citizen differs fundamentally from that on the continent. In France, Spain and Italy, the gendarmerie, guardia civil or carabinieri are part of the armed forces. Here, the police are civilians in uniform. In his nine principles, Robert Peel, the founder of modern policing, said: “The police at all times should maintain a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and the public are the police”.That is a golden thread that has run through our liberties to this day. On Monday, the eminent jurist Lord Sumption made precisely these points, doubtless to a chorus of raspberries from those listeners who welcome the warm embrace of the state like that of a favourite uncle. “This is what a police state is like,” Sumption said. “It’s a state in which the government can issue orders or express preferences with no legal authority and the police will enforce ministers’ wishes.”The emergency powers are to be reviewed every six months but for as long as there is the prospect of another outbreak, as there will be in the autumn, this will be a rubber-stamping exercise by Parliament. So how long will they last?Since the reason given for this draconian action is to protect the health service and its staff, the Government should repeal the emergency powers once the NHS is able to cope with the epidemic, which experts think might already be happening. When it does, we need to manage the contagion without imposing intolerable restrictions on people to move around and work, as the Swedes, almost alone, have done.Yet the temptation to continue with controls will be strong, all in the name of protecting the NHS, of course. We may not have ID cards, but most of us carry the means for the state to track our movements and even our wellbeing in the form of our smartphones. As we see in China and Israel, the technology exists to keep tabs on where we go and to establish whether we are clear of any particular ailment and therefore entitled to travel or even go shopping.There are many people who will accept such tracking if they think it keeps them safe, and politicians will be under pressure to use the threat of a renewed pandemic to extend it and make it compulsory.In wartime, we accepted controls because they were considered necessary. How long will we put up with them once the worst has passed?

We have a very large workforce of people experienced in antibody testing who would be very keen to be involved.“When they sent round a request a couple of weeks ago to supply the PCR machines there was a very specific model they wanted. Of our machines there was only one of that type, and the army came and collected it and took it off to Milton Keynes.“But we have another 118 machines that can broadly do the same job, but they don’t appear to be part of PHE’s plans. Not all are oven ready, but a proportion are. They could be adapted easily - it’s a totally routine lab technique. “About two weeks ago one of my colleagues spent two days trying to be a bit irritating and chasing PHE up to offer our help. There was a lot of general enthusiasm - they said, ‘Oh that’s great and we’re really happy that you want to help’. And then nothing really came of it. That’s been the same for many institutions across the country. I can’t really understand why.”At the Francis Crick Institute, one of the world’s leading biomedical research centres based in London, insiders told a similar story.The institute has supplied five PCR machines to PHE labs so far, but is understood to have dozens more inside its labs. A spokesman added that no firm word had yet been received from PHE as to whether any further machines or expertise would be required.“We have hundreds of scientists with different areas of expertise ready and willing to step in to help support the national drive to tackle the outbreak,” the spokesman told The .We were approached by Public Health England for support with their testing programme, and have already sent 5 PCR machines to support it. We are supportive their work at this really difficult time, are ready and enthusiastic to help with the testing programme, and recognise that setting it up and then scaling it can’t be done overnight.Other institutions across the country are understood to have had similar offers of help rejected by Public Health England.Ministers are acutely aware that Britain’s failure to carry out more tests has become the weak leak in the response to the pandemic, and are desperate to ramp up mass testing.Boris Johnson set a deadline of mid-April for testing to increase to 25,000 per day, only for Public Health England to say it could be the end of April before that target is reached - which will still be barely a third of Germany’s current capacity.There is also growing anger at the NHS’s failure to take advantage of spare capacity in the system to test its own staff so that those who are self-isolating as a precaution can get back to work if they are virus-free.Britain can now carry out 12,700 tests per day, but only 8,240 tests were done in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning, meaning opportunities were missed to test up to 4,460 doctors, nurses and medical staff.The figure for “wasted” testing opportunities was more than 1,000 more than the previous day.With up to a quarter of staff ill or self-isolating at some hospitals, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made clear his frustration in a conference call with NHS and PHE bosses on Tuesday.A rule that 85 per cent of tests had to be reserved for patients was scrapped on Tuesday by Mr Hancock, who told hospitals there was now no limit on the number of tests they could carry out on staff. He thinks any spare capacity is unacceptable and doesn\u0027t want any tests to go to waste, a source close to the health secretary said on Tuesday night.Senior health sources, however, told The  that the Government’s controversial strategy in the early stages of the pandemic may mean that Britain has already “missed the boat” on mass testing.Initially the Government’s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, decided with the agreement of senior ministers the disease should be mitigated rather than suppressed, sources explained.It was agreed that under the much-maligned ‘herd immunity’ approach, widespread testing would not be required given around 60 per cent of the population was expected to catch the disease anyway. Instead, priority was given to protecting the vulnerable and ensuring the NHS did not become overwhelmed by building up intensive care capacity, and procuring ventilators to keep patients alive.That meant laboratory capacity was not ramped up, and there was no drive to order the crucial components needed to produce thousands of testing kits. On March 12 it was decided to halt community contact tracing, and to focus testing on hospital patients instead.Meanwhile, other countries took a different path, and began buying up large stocks of kit for mass-community testing. In Germany and South Korea, officials quickly mobilised a vast network of laboratories to start producing tests in huge numbers.Around two weeks ago, Britain’s strategy switched after Imperial College modellers warned that leaving the disease to spread largely unchallenged could result in 250,000 deaths.But by this time test kits were in short supply and laboratories had not been readied for action. Initially only a single Government lab, PHE’s main facility at Colindale, was charged with processing tests, with 11 more added later, along with 29 laboratory networks run by NHS Trusts.At that early stage, thousands of swabs sent to PHE by GPs who suspected their patients had contracted the disease were destroyed before they were analysed because they did not meet strict criteria, sources revealed.“If they had looked at those swabs earlier instead of throwing them away, we could have got a handle on this thing much earlier,” one GP told The .When it became clear that the herd immunity strategy risked disaster, the strategy changed and ministers and public health officials began prioritising testing amid widespread criticism.But the about-turn may have come too late. Laboratories are now struggling to buy in key chemicals needed to produce the testing kits, with reports that NHS Trusts have been forced to “home brew” their own. One order of so-called “primers and probes” from a firm based in Luxembourg was even discovered to itself be contaminated with coronavirus, leading to a delay in production.At the Downing Street press conference, Michael Gove insisted Boris Johnson was now personally leading efforts to source much-needed chemicals from abroad.“The prime minister and the health secretary are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds,” he said.The Government still hopes to have millions of antibody tests to determine whether someone has ever contracted the disease available in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, other nations have ramped up their testing programmes with Germany now expecting to test up to half a million people every week.As the pressure grows, PHE is understood to still believe that a centralised testing system will produce better, more reliable results. There are also understood to be concerns around biosafety if thousands of samples are exchanged between smaller laboratories across the country.Officials now plan to launch “supercentres” to process the tests on a larger scale, in partnership with the private sector. A test centre for NHS workers opened on Tuesday in the car park of an Ikea store in Wembley, north-west London.A Public Health England spokesman said: “COVID-19 only started to emerge at the beginning of the year and since then, PHE has managed to rapidly develop, validate and deliver an accurate test. PHE has since expanded to 12 other testing sites in England and supported the NHS to start testing at greater capacity in their labs. “This is the fastest deployment of a novel test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the Swine flu pandemic in 2009.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up eurovision sunlit","story":"The list of beloved cultural institutions this virus has seen off is appalling.

This led to her developing highly invasive cancer which required chemo-radiotherapy treatment, leaving her infertile at the age of 29.XX, now 36, says one of her central ambitions in life is to have her own family and that, despite the profound, distressing and life-altering injuries caused by her treatment, her loss of fertility is her major concern.She was initially awarded a total of £580,000 in damages, but the High Court refused to award damages to cover the costs of four commercial surrogacies in California, where the practice is legal and binding. Commercial surrogacies are illegal in the UK.In a landmark ruling in December 2018, the Court of Appeal said XX was entitled to as much as an additional £560,000 to cover the cost of having children with a commercial surrogate in the US.The trust took the case to the UK\u0027s highest court, arguing that the Court of Appeal was wrong to award the additional damages because commercial surrogacy is contrary to public policy.However, announcing the ruling via livestream on Wednesday, Supreme Court president Lord Reed said the court had decided by a 3-2 majority that XX could recover the costs of commercial surrogacy in the US.Money has to compensate, as far as it can, for those injuries that cannot be cured,” Lord Reed said.    “For some women, the ability to bear and to rear children is a vital part of their identity. What then should be the measure of damages for a woman who has been wrongfully deprived of the ability to bear children herself?   “Along with general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity, should it include the cost of making surrogacy arrangements with another woman to bear a child for her to bring up? In particular, should it include the cost of making commercial surrogacy arrangements abroad?   In short, I consider that the decision of the Court of Appeal was correct in 2001, and remains correct today,” Lord Reed concluded. Responding to the judgement, Cara Nuttall, a family lawyer specialising in surrogacy, of law firm JMW, said: “Women who have been denied having children as a result of clinical negligence have now had a massive obstacle to starting their family removed. “It also removes the long wait for a surrogate and should now be a more straightforward journey. This has broken the hurdle of this not being allowed because of it being contrary to public policy, but this judgement now marks a seismic shift in the social approach and attitudes to surrogacy.”Ms Nuttall explained that California is “the gold star destination” for surrogacy in terms of having the best setup for commercial surrogacy and benefits, and, as a result, there are a lot more willing surrogates around.In a statement, XX\u0027s solicitor, Anne Kavanagh, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, added: This is a tragic case in which there are no winners. The only option available to our client in starting a family is through surrogacy, using her own eggs which were harvested just before she started chemo-radiotherapy, as well as using donor eggs.There is an established legal system in place in California which ensures that the interests of all involved - the surrogate, the commissioning parents and any resulting child - are properly safeguarded. Today\u0027s landmark judgment has confirmed that, to achieve the family she was denied by the admitted negligence of the trust, XX is entitled to funds to cover the cost of surrogacy in California as well as the use of donor eggs.Our client is relieved that this matter, which has consumed more than 10 years of her life, is over. We will continue to support XX as she now attempts to look to the future and hopefully realise her dream of having the family she has always wanted. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/16/16/norwaypm.jpg","title":"coronavirus nordic economies job losses unemployment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.With a combined population of roughly 27 million people, the Nordic region has seen 580,000 workers put on temporary leaveIn one of the richest and most stable corners of the globe, well over half a million people are suddenly out of a job due to the economic standstill triggered by the spread of the coronavirus.With a combined population of roughly 27 million people, the Nordic region has seen 580,000 workers put on temporary leave, many without paychecks in recent weeks.

Reversing the increase would deny a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, including many in sectors such as care, retail and cleaning, who are on the front line in the national effort to tackle the virus.”Polling by the institute found that 66 per cent of adults last October believed the level of the minimum wage to be too low. Only 2 per cent said it was too high.Support for hiking the minimum wage was highest among young adults and low-income households.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The term it uses for the statutory wage floor for younger workers is the national minimum wage.The national minimum wage is £4.55 for 16-17 year olds in 202021, £6.45 for those aged 18-20 and £8.00 for 21-24 year olds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a very unnerving thing to get.”Morgan has not seen any of his three sons, who do not live with him, since the UK government imposed a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.As he coughed, Morgan noted: “I know some people at home will be thinking, oh there he goes he has got it.“People on TV cough all the time, I hear people do it on air. But it will worry people.

We have taken swift and decisive action to ensure that the company is well placed for the aftermath and has the talent to compete immediately.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We\u0027re thrilled to have the opportunity to reach far more people, with far more impact, than we ever could alone.It is not clear what Apple plans to do with the weather app, but it will presumably be folded into the forecasts that are provided by the built-in tool in the iPhone and other platforms.

in areas with hot and humid climates?Can Covid-19 be transmitted through mosquito bites?Can I use hand dryers and ultraviolet disinfection lamps to kill Covid-19?How effective are thermal scanners for detecting infected people?Should I spray alcohol or chlorine on myself to kill Covid-19?Will a pneumonia vaccine protect me against the virus?What about antibiotics?As the new coronavirus spreads around the globe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has been working to make sure people have accurate information on how to stay safe and healthy.There is currently no specific medicine to prevent or treat the virus, formally known as Covid-19, which has infected more than 200,000 people worldwide.However, the WHO has advised people of all ages to take simple steps to protect themselves, such as by frequently cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.Although older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to serious illness, the WHO has said all people should take steps to protect themselves from Covid-19.\u0026nbspYou can find the organisation’s advice on some common myths and misconceptions about the virus below.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1 Can Covid-19 be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates?Current evidence shows Covid-19 can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather, and protective measures need to be adopted in any area reporting the virus, regardless of climate.There is no reason to believe cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases, as the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5 to 37C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.Taking a hot bath will also not prevent you from catching Covid-19, and\u0026nbsptaking a bath with extremely hot water can also be harmful\u0026nbspas it can burn you.2 Can Covid-19 be transmitted through mosquito bites?There has been no information or evidence to date to suggest that the new coronavirus can be transmitted by mosquitoes.Covid-19 is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.3 Can I use hand dryers and ultraviolet disinfection lamps to kill Covid-19?The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus -- and where has it spread?Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus and to protect yourself, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Once your hands are cleaned, you should then dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.UV lamps should not be used to sterilise hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.4 How effective are thermal scanners for detecting infected people?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever – those with a higher than normal body temperature – because of infection with Covid-19.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.\u0026nbspThis is because it takes between two\u0026nbspand 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.5 Should I spray alcohol or chlorine on myself to kill Covid-19?Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body and spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes, such as your eyes and mouth.Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful for disinfecting surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.Similarly, there is also no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline can protect people from infection by the new coronavirus.6 Will a pneumonia vaccine protect me against the virus?Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against Covid-19.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine, which researchers are currently working on trying to develop.Although these vaccines are not effective against Covid-19, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.7 What about antibiotics?Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria, and should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment for Covid-19\u0026nbsp– which is a virus.However, if someone is hospitalised for the new coronavirus, they may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.No

Reversing the increase would deny a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, including many in sectors such as care, retail and cleaning, who are on the front line in the national effort to tackle the virus.”Polling by the institute found that 66 per cent of adults last October believed the level of the minimum wage to be too low. Only 2 per cent said it was too high.Support for hiking the minimum wage was highest among young adults and low-income households.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The term it uses for the statutory wage floor for younger workers is the national minimum wage.The national minimum wage is £4.55 for 16-17 year olds in 202021, £6.45 for those aged 18-20 and £8.00 for 21-24 year olds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Ladies in BlackWhisper of the HeartWhen the Game Stands TallViolet Evergarden: Eternity and the Auto Memory DollWelcome to MercyPokemon the Series: Sun \u0026amp Moon season 3 – Ultra LegendsThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a Twitter post, Theroux highlighted his encounter with the man himself in\u0026nbspAmerica’s Most Dangerous Pets, which was originally broadcast in October 2011.The synopsis reads: “Travelling to America’s heartlands, Louis Theroux spends time with an Oklahoma man who has bred and collected over 150 tigers, visits the woman who privately owns one of America’s largest collections of chimpanzees, and finds himself in uncomfortably close contact with a number of big cats and dangerous primates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTheroux’s\u0026nbspspecial sees him follow Exotic as he goes about his daily routine as part of GW Exotic Animal Foundation in Oklahoma.One moment sees him tell Theroux that if he were to get into the cage with his tigers, he would shoot him to spare him a grisly fate.39 hidden gems to stream while self-isolatingWhy Netflix has become a graveyard for great showsEvery film and TV series coming to Netflix UK in April“If he was to get you and not kill you and eat you right away, he’s going to torment you,” Exotic said. “So, if you were to get in there and I was out here trying to get you out he would be on top of you covering you up. I’d just shoot you, it would be more humane.”Incredulous, Theroux replies:\u0026nbsp“You would shoot me? In the head?”Exotic is also seen expressing excitement over an oncoming tornado, which is immediately followed by\u0026nbspTheroux narrating: “The day before\u0026nbspin neighbouring Missouri, a tornado had killed more than 150 people.”The episode is available to watch on BBC iPlayer here.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspExotic is currently serving a 22-year sentence for a number of charges, including two counts of murder-for-hire.Theroux promised to share his full thoughts on Netflix’s\u0026nbspseven-part documentary, which was one of the streaming service’s most-watched original titles in March.Exotic – real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage\u0026nbsp– was jailed last year for 22 years, for crimes including trying to hire someone to murder Baskin, and for various crimes related to endangered species and conservation.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some of them have seen a drop in incomes, or they’re not sure when they’re going to be working again.”“We do have some money to buy more supplies, but we could do with wider agreement with the big supermarkets to let food charities register and buy supplies they need in bulk,” the operations manager added.“We also welcome the sharing of good ideas through the Help The Hungry campaign, as we have to let people across the country who might never have needed help before know what’s there for them.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These would later be delivered to the doorsteps of poor, elderly and vulnerable residents of Haringey, as identified on the council’s database, as well as to the homes of local children eligible for free school meals.\u0026nbspSpurs chair\u0026nbspDaniel Levy said: “As a club, we have always been clear about our commitment to the wider community — and never has this been more important than it is now. We are immensely proud of the efforts of everybody involved in the fight against Covid-19 and see today as just the start of what we can do as a club to assist.”How to support our campaignA Haringey council spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid 150 of the borough’s most vulnerable families would have got food parcels delivered yesterday. Production will be ramped up from today to several thousand food parcels daily.\u0026nbspThe packers are council employees transferred from non-priority services and volunteers from Edible London, a local charity tackling food poverty.A second Haringey hub, located at Alexandra Palace,\u0026nbspalso became operational yesterday, and will be used to supply food to borough residents with severe underlying health problems in self-isolation as part of the government’s Covid-19 “shielded” category.Joseph Ejiofor, leader of Haringey council, said: “I’m inspired by the generosity of our community who have stepped up to help so quickly. We have staff and volunteers working tirelessly at our two food redistribution centres, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Alexandra Palace, alongside our voluntary sector partners, Edible London.“Working together we’re ensuring food gets to households who need it most.

Its most recent accounts recorded a pre-tax loss of £11.5m for the year ending September 2018, after a period of profitability that followed the move, in 2009, to a free-distribution model.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The outcomes are now being seenTwo weeks into social distancing and early data has indicated San Francisco\u0027s coronavirus curve could be flattening.Prior to the regulations, the Bay Area officials were concerned with how Covid-19 infections would impact the community.San Francisco Mayor London Breed and five mayors in the surrounding Bay Area issued a stay-at-home order on 16 March in response to concerns, an unprecedented move at the time. Then California Governor Gavin Newsom quickly followed his city mayors by ordering a statewide state-at-home order to the nearly 40m residents.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn\u0026nbspNew York, by\u0026nbspcomparison, the current US epicentre for the pandemic, Governor Andrew Cuomo waited to issue a stay-at-home order. It went into effect almost a week later on 22 March. This order was in partnership with Connecticut and New Jersey to help combat the spread of the virus.Now San Francisco has only 374 cases and six people have died from the novel virus. In the 10 Bay Area counties, there have been more than 2,200 confirmed cases and 57 deaths. Comparatively, New York City has 43,139 cases and 932 deaths, as of Tuesday. Authorities warn that this death toll will go up.So was it\u0026nbspthe early intervention\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspCalifornia officials that helped\u0026nbspflatten the curve on the west coast?Potentially, but Dr George Rutherford, professor and epidemiology \u0026amp biostatistics\u0026nbspdirector at the University of California, San Francisco, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent it is\u0026nbsptoo early for the Bay Area to determine if the curve is actually flattening.Our official line is it is too soon to call. It could all go south tomorrow, he said.One factor that contributed to government officials closing down San Francisco early is it is\u0026nbspthe densest and oldest county, with more people over the age of 65 compared to the rest of California.Dr Robyn Gershon, clinical professor of epidemiology at NYU School of Global Public Health, also said the county had early warning signs of how the virus could be spreading in the US.San Francisco had a little bit of early warning because they are so close to the Asian countries, she said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWarning signs also came from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which sailed just outside San Francisco for days before it was able to dock on 10 March. Companies like Apple and Google, both based in Silicon Valley, allowed their employees to stay home starting as early as 5 March.While this was all happening, millions of people every day were still taking the New York City subway and bus systems, which Dr Gershon said potentially aided the exponential spread in Manhattan.I think what really helped them is that (San Francisco) doesn\u0027t have mass transit, the epidemiologist said. New York City has kept open the mass transit because so many depend on it.It is very easy to spread, Dr Gershon added. It seems to spread from one person to three.When comparing New York City and San Francisco, similarities include both having high rates of a vulnerable elderly population, homeless people, and people living below the poverty line. These variables can contribute to each city getting hit harder with the virus compared to other parts of the US. But San Francisco isn\u0027t seeing quite the same hit.We are way outstripping them, Dr Gershon said about the number of cases and hospitalisations in New York City, adding: When you think of San Francisco and the counties, yeah they have a lot of people but in San Francisco ... it is not dense. It\u0027s not the dense close living that we have here.Dr Jeremy Greene, professor and director of the Institute of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, warned against comparing New York City and San Francisco based on how quickly regulations were put in place.I think that it\u0027s a dangerous game to compare the differential epidemic in New York City in San Francisco, he said. Yes, we know that California did put into place shelter-in-place orders earlier than New York ... but I don\u0027t believe that the difference that we are seeing between New York and San Francisco can be attributed to a political will-to-action.Covid-19 differs from that of influenza because people show little to no symptoms for weeks after first being infected.While we have earlier evidence of community spread in California over New York, we have no reason to believe that is the truth of the epidemiology, Dr Greene added. Coronavirus could\u0027ve been spreading in the New York area for far longer and clearly spreading in a denser capacity.EU says Trump\u0027s \u0027miracle\u0027 malaria drug \u0027has not been proved\u0027 effective\u0027It’s like being on eBay\u0027: Cuomo attacks US healthcare as coronavirus Fossil fuels should have cigarette-style warnings, health experts sayLouisiana sees large surge in coronavirus casesThe number of cases in every\u0026nbspcity and state has not been the most reliable factor when determining how Covid-19 has impacted the area because of the lack of testing capabilities in different parts of the US.Unlike influenza - where the disease manifests and it is clearly influenza - coronavirus is so silent that in the absence of a robust testing form, we\u0027re operating blind, Dr Greene said. The United States had several opportunities to aggressively ramp up and employ proper screening mechanisms on a level that South Korea deployed, and we failed to do so. And at this point we have no capacity to do so.In New York City, 89,197 residents have received tests for Covid-19 and more than 200,000 people in the state. California, in comparison, has only tested 89,600, as of last week. But case numbers in each area could be exponentially higher given how silent Covid-19 symptoms are in carriers.Hospitalisations and death rates are stronger indicators on how the virus has impacted communities, but even that data can be flawed in understanding the true level of the pandemic.The ICU hospitalisations are higher than we would\u0027ve thought relative to the other ones, Rutherford said about the Bay Area. Of the total number of California cases, 1,432 hospitalisations and 597 people are the ICU, a number that tripled from the weekend.Santa Clara, which has been hit the hardest in the Bay Area, reported 125 hospitalisations.\u0026nbspNew York City has more than 7,741 people hospitalised, 1,700 of which are in the ICU.Stay-at-home orders impact on states like California and New York will not be seen for another few weeks as less and less people are coming in contact with each other.It\u0027s going to take a couple of generations, 10 to 14 days, to see some peaking in the curve, Dr Rutherford said. And that is assuming the effect (of the virus) happens instantly.The epidemiologist added even though signs are cautiously showing the curve could be flattening, this was not the time for the Bay Area to lift regulations. Instead, it was announced the stay-at-home order across California\u0026nbspwould extend until 1 May.You have to be cautious about this stuff, he said. This is the time to save those 10 to 20,000 (lives).New York City has been clear that\u0026nbspadditional weeks are needed\u0026nbspto determine where the curve is going, and Mr Cuomo\u0026nbspsaid that apex could happen in seven to 21 days. New York state\u0027s stay-at-home order was extended through\u0026nbsp15 April with the anticipation for it to get pushed back again.Everyone who is infected by four weeks out is going to show up, Dr Gorshen added. They will be identified. (New York City) can then flatten the curve of our hospital surge.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

one of the key symptoms of Covid-.The government has released guidelines explaining that people should self-isolate for seven daysthey are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, including a dry persistent cough.Here, we take you through this main symptom and how to protect yourself and your family.A dry persistent cough is a ‘classic’ symptom of coronavirus, according to Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and Clinical Director of Patientaccess.She says a dry persistent cough is:The NHS describes a dry cough as a cough where no phlegm or mucus is produced, which is also irritating and usually associated with a tickly throat.As well as a dry persistent cough, health officials say the two other most common symptoms of coronavirus infection usually include a high temperature and shortness of breath.However, as Covid- is a new virus, experts are still working to understand it.To receive our Covid- newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.A loss of smell or taste can also be a sign that you have contracted coronavirus.Despite this, developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Some people will not develop all of these symptoms -  and some might not even show symptoms at all, experts say.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UKs chief scientic adviser, said: It looks quite likely that there is some degree of asymptomatic transmission.There’s definitely quite a lot of transmission very early in the disease when there are very mild symptoms.Around one out of every six who gets Covid- become seriously ill and develops dficulty breathing, according to the WHO.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are at most risk developing serious illness.This can include pneumonia and swelling in the lungs, which can make it hard for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream - leading to organ failure and death.Severe pneumonia can kill people by causing them to drown in the fluid flooding their lungs.People with fever, cough and dficulty breathing should seek medical attention, the WHO says.If youre in doubt whether you have coronavirus you can visit the Patient Access clinically approved coronavirus checking tool here.Symptoms are thought to appear between two and  days.New research has found that the average incubation period of Covid- is . days.A study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US found that almost allof those who develop symptoms appeared to do so within . days of infection.Experts say there is little evidence to suggest that people can spread the virus without showing symptoms.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene, health experts say.Health bosses say the best way to protect yourself and others is to wash your hands with soap and water for the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.Happy Birthday takes about  seconds to sing twice and is said to be the perfect number to clean your hands to thoroughly.If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitiser that contains at least  per cent alcohol.Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.If Covid- is spreading in your community, take extra measures to put distance between yourself and other people - especially those who are more vulnerable - to further reduce your risk of being exposed to this new virus.Stay at home as much as possible and consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social, or commercial networks.According to a  study in the American Journal of Infection Control, people touch their faces more than  times an hour on average.However, youll need to try your best not to do thisyou want to protect yourself from coronavirus.This is because were constantly touching surfaces contaminated with pathogens such as doorknobs, phones and handrails.These pathogens can be picked up by our hands and get into the body through mucous membranes on the face — eyes, nose, and mouth — that act as pathways to the throat and lungs.Also, make sure to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.Throw used tissues in the bin straight away.Its hard to know when someone is going to cough or sneeze, butyou can, try and avoid standing within two metres of them.Droplets from a cough or sneeze can travel up to approximately ftwhen expelled through the air.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, counter tops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Like a milk float.Even the great libertarian Boris ­Johnson — a former motoring correspondent for GQ magazine — has been involved, handing half the road network over to wretched cyclists.Well, now’s the time to stop all that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.During the Covid- outbreak, when it’s important we keep our distance, all ­parking restrictions should be lted.Cars should be allowed to use both bus and cycle lanes and all traffic cameras should be turned off. I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In my view, we went down the wrong path.It comes after the UKs death toll yesterday surged to ,, with the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the country standing at ,.The UK has been slow to test in comparison to other countries - with less than , daily swabs being carried out until March.And Prof Sridhar added that it was this delay in testing that could mean the UK will be stuck in lockdown for a longer duration of time than other countries.We will be stuck in lockdown until we get test, trace, isolation plan, she said. We are basically pressing pause on the spread of virus while we race to catch up. If were not using the time now, then were just wasting days months in lockdown not aggressively figuring out where virus is.Prof Sridhar said the Government should learn from South Korea, whose “trace, test, treat” policy is being lauded as one of the world’s best approaches to tackling the virus.In particular, the South Korean Government have carried out , tests and got Covid- under control.South Korea never had lockdown, only  deaths, and didnt expose health staff to unnecessary risk and pressure, Prof Sridhar added.Each day in lockdown: kids fall into poverty, domestic abuse increases, social fabric comes apart, major economic hit.Lockdowns are expensive.

This will evaporate and you will not need to wipe it off.The active ingredient in surface wipes in an antiseptic - usually benzalkonium chloride.The wipes work by physically removing germs through the pressure you apply when you use them, and the germs then attach to the wipe.They also leave a layer of the antiseptic on the surface that works to kill germs.The antiseptic is shown to work well on bacteria as well as on coronaviruses that infect mice and dogs – but so far, there is no evidence that antiseptics can kill human coronaviruses.Its important to remember your clothes and towels can be a hot-bed for germs, especiallytheyre used by more than one person.This is why its key you wash your clothes more than you usually would during the coronavirus outbreak.In particular, the higher the temperature you wash your clothes in - the more likely you are to kill of any signs of Covid-.And the much revered  degree wash wont necessarily be enough to kill the virus.Laundryheap CEO Deyan Dimitrov says: Our core body temperature runs at an average of C, and provides the ideal conditions for bacteria and viruses to thrive.This meansyou’re looking to fight off the dreaded coronavirus, the much revered C wash might not always pack the punch needed.“Most viruses won’t survive in temperatures over C, so you could opt for this setting items that are particularly germ ridden and washed less often, like tea towels, bedding, bath towels, gloves, scarves, and children’s clothing.However,you’re concerned about your environmental impact by washing clothes at a high temperature, just make sure youre washing clothes far more often instead.You also need to make sure you get the formula right while washing your clothes during coronavirus lockdown - as using extra detergent can be counter-productive.Deyan says: Too much detergent will create extra soap suds which will cling to your laundry and trap dirt there, rather than lt it away.Instead, opt for the recommended dosage, and when it comes to fabric softener, try giving white vinegar a go instead of chemical alternatives.It’s naturally antibacterial and works wonders at softening and freshening up clothes. Just add ½ a cup to the washing machine drawer during the rinse cycle.The smell will dissipate in the machine but you can add some essential oilsyou’re after added fragrance.If youre sharing a house with someone who is poorly it is key you make sure everything is disinfected quickly and effectively after them.Experts urge people to handle all bedding and clothing with rubber gloves and wash straight away - and to never leave it sitting in a hamper.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the scheme does not apply to people who started a new job after the cut-off date of February . Instead, the only way for them to be furloughed is to be rehired to their previous job and then be put on the scheme. Whether this happens is up to the old employer. This stops well short of demands by thousands of workers who said the date of February  must be extended. The Mirror understands the government is resisting calls to extend the scheme beyond February  because of practical dficulties. To prevent fraud, officials decided to capture peopleaposs earnings in February - the most recent full month - to work out how much they are owed through the scheme. Senior officials are understood to be aware of the loophole, but believe there had to be a cut-off date for the Treasury to snapshot peopleaposs earnings.

Michael Gove last night announced the first of thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line this weekend, and be delivered to the NHS next week. However, while tens of thousands of ventilators have been ordered, Mr Gove did not clary exactly how many would roll off the production line this weekend. Today the government claried this number is in the region of . Officials insisted potentially hundreds more of the Penlon devices could arrive in the weeks afterwards, with thousands of other ventilators in the coming months. Separately, thousands of ventilators are also being ordered from overseas. It is not confirmed what the progress of these is, but they were due to arrive in stages over the course of weeks and months. The number emerged after the number of coronavirus patients admitted to UK hospitals soared past , for the first time. Britain is racing to buy in , off-the-shelf ventilators from overseas to add to , the NHS already has. On top of this, the government launched a ventilator challenge urging UK firms to produce hastily-designed le-saving devices. The  new ventilators to be delivered next week are part of this challenge - and are the first to be produced and approved for use. They are known as the Penlon ventilator device and have been adapted from existing designs by a consortium of firms, rather than built from scratch. The consortiumaposs leaders include Formula  teams McLaren and Mercedes, Ford, Siemens and Meggitt. Aside from this, Dyson also have an agreement to produce , ventilators for the UK government but theyaposre yet to be approved by regulators.  And a team led by UCL, working with Mercedes Benz, will produce a further , new CPAPdevices to support affected patients. If all the orders are fulfilled, they could be enough to meet the peak demand in the NHS - leaving no Covid- patient without the vital breathing device. But the government has faced criticism for not acting sooner, given many orders will take months to fulfil. Former Tory justice minister Dr Phillip Lee, who later defected to the Lib Dems, said we knew in January that Covid- was dangerous and there was a ventilator capacity problem. I donapost understand how the government didnapost at that point err on the side of caution and start ordering ventilators, he told Sky News. He said there should be , or , sat in a warehouse after an exercise in  showed the capacity wasnapost there.

We are beyond devastated.A GoFundMe page set up to cover funeral expenses reached the £, mark on Wednesday morning.The initial fundraising target was £,. Madinah College, which offers Arabic language and Islamic studies courses, set up the page and said the extra money will go directly to the family. It said on Wednesday: The family is overwhelmed and grateful to all the donors and prayers, may Allah bless you and reward you all.  Ismail was admitted to Kingaposs College Hospital last Thursday and tested positive for coronavirus the following day. His mother and six siblings are awaiting the results of a post-mortem which will confirm the cause of death and determine whether he had any pre-existing conditions. Fundraiser and family friend Mark Stephenson, an academic director at Madinah College, where Ismailaposs sister works, said: Ismail was tested positive for Covid-. They have not released the body yet, as the coroner wants to do an autopsy - Iaposm assuming due to his young age and not having underlying conditions.

May Allah grant the family patience through this dficult time and make it a means of drawing closer to Him.  Ismailaposs death came the same day as that of a -year-old girl in Belgium. She is the youngest person to die in Europe after contracting coronavirus. In recent days, a -year-old boy has died in Portugal and a -year-old girl has died at a hospital in Paris. Luca Di Nicola, , an assistant chef from Nereto, Italy, died at North Middlesex Hospital in Enfield, north London, last Tuesday from apparent fulminant pneumonia. His family said he was very healthy and the NHS confirmed he had no underlying health conditions.

Speaking on Wednesday morning, Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the deaths of a -year-old and a -year-old with coronavirus is a reminder that the disease affects everyone. He told BBC Breakfast: Every death is a tragedy, but two young people dying is even more sobering. It does remind us all that this is a virus thataposs indiscriminate. It doesnapost just affect the elderly, or those who are extremely vulnerable because of their pre-existing conditions, although those people do need to take particular care. It can affect all of us and I think many young people have felt, or some young people have felt, almost invincible, and you saw that in some of the scenes a couple of weeks ago of young people out enjoying themselves when we first started to implement some of the social distancing measures.  I think now everybody in the country understands and appreciates the seriousness of the situation, and is following the medical advice, which is to stay at home, by doing so protect the NHS and help to save lives. A Kingaposs College Hospital spokesperson said of Ismailaposs death: Sadly, a -year old boy who tested positive for Covid- has passed away, and our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this time. The death has been referred to the Coroner and no further comment will be made.” Dr Nathalie MacDermott, NIHR Academic Clinical Lecturer, Kingaposs College London, said: It is very sad to hear of the death of a -year-old infected with Covid-. While we know it is much less likely for children to suffer severe Covid- infection than older adults, this case highlights the importance of us all taking the precautions we can to reduce the spread of infection in the UK and worldwide.

Despite government orders for all non-essential business operations to halt during the deadly Covid- outbreak, the boiler firmaposs Worcester branch wants to ensure it doesnapost fall behind. With certain competitor factories having shut their doors for the foreseeable future, the Bosch plant has been telling production staff to continue working, heightening the risk of them catching the virus. There will then be a brief shutdown period for a fortnight from April  in which staff are to use holiday allowance - before ing later in the month in an effort to get a head start on summer production. In an internal email sent to employees - and seen by the- Bosch admitted demand is down and supply of component parts is currently a critical issue for us. And with a subsequent major push going to be needed to make up for the dip, they canapost afford staff to be taking time off later in the year. We cannot leave ourselves in a position when we do get through this, that most of our employees still have a full yearaposs holiday to take in the second half of the year, the email said. We are using a period of shutdown to realign our business in line with this situation, it continued.   This will have an adverse impact on our business. We are committed to ensuring we retain a strong business and our workforce into the longer term.   It said workloads need to be carefully managed through the coming period and asked all Bosch Thermotechnology aposassociatesapos to act responsibly and take two weeks Easter break using paid holidays.  We understand that this is not the ideal time to take holidays but by using a reasonable share of them at this time of the year the business will be better placed once the coronavirus outbreak has abated to ensure a strong ramp up as demand grows once more, the email added.  One factory employee - who did not wish to be named - told thethe holiday allowance has allegedly already been automatically taken to account for those two weeks off. They claimed the email has been translated by production staff to mean weaposve got no demand and canapost get parts, so weaposre taking holiday off you so you canapost use it later in the year when we have parts.  All about profits. Absolute joke, they said. The disgruntled worker went on to claim staff were told to take four holiday days at the start of the year for Christmas shutdown and now this. We get  days holiday a year and half of it has been dictated by the company so that they can have everyone flat out in the summer building to get ahead of Ideal [Boilers], who is our major competitor. Itaposs all theyaposve been worrying about for months. Ideal have shut so theyaposre trying to get ahead.  They continued: Ideal have come up as a big worry for the company in the past few months, as theyaposve gone from nothing to a big competitor. And here we are. Itaposs a joke, shameful of a multi-million [pound] company. They claimed the two metre distance rule is not being enforced on the factory floor while  per cent of managerial support is from home. Itaposs literally the workers building with little support from above.  One apparent Bosch worker took to Twitter to complain the company is still sending field service engineers into peopleaposs homes every day. Referring to the Worcester factory floor staff being forced to take two weeks holiday at Easter, they added: [Theyaposre] not key workers so why are they being forced in  Another person tweeted: Why is Worcester Bosch still making their staff work in this coronavirus outbreak, putting lives at risk  In response, a Bosch spokesperson said it is fully supportive of its staff and has implemented all of the government’s most current guidelines during this constantly changing situation.  The spokesperson said manufacturing is not on the government’s list of businesses that need to close providing the guidance on hygiene, safe distancing etc can be complied with. Referring to engineers entering peopleaposs homes, they said the government has stated this can continue to provide essential repair and maintenance providing they are well and have no symptoms of the virus. They said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategyaposs guidelines state thatyou are not specically required to close the workplace then it is important to carry on the business.  However, the spokesperson went on to emphasise while all employees where possible are being asked to work from home, manufacturing and logistic teams need to come to site to carry out their work. They said the company has provided full guidance on hygiene and social distancing for those in vital areas - including the Worcester plant. We have communicated guidelines and implemented our own measures, such as redesigning our factory floors to demonstrate how to maintain appropriate social distancing, although we would like to stress that it is down to inidual employees to adhere to the guidance in line with the government advice.

The report stated that aposcases of pneumonia of unknown etiologydetected in Wuhanapos. We now know that concerns had been raised a few weeks earlier in China and that the delays in taking action did not just cost valuable time but also cost lives. Outbreaks of emerging infectious disease are not uncommon. But when they are not dealt with quickly, they can be devastating. What makes Covid- unusual is the way and the speed at which it has spread around the world. Just three months have passed since the alert to the World Health Organisation. It is almost unbelievable to think that not millions or even hundreds of millions of people around the world are now in lock-down - but billions. Entire populations are in isolation, with .billion in India alone forced to stay indoors. Streets are empty – at least of humans. Videos from all over Europe show wild boar, goats and even badgers roaming through town centres asthese were their natural habitats. As well as the stock markets that have collapsed, affecting pensions and savings, mass lay-offs, airlines that may never fly again and more, the mental strains of being cut off from family and friends are not easy to handle – especially alongside the fears of infection. And then of course there are the tragedies of those who have died, whether young and healthy or otherwise - each loss leaves an unfillable gap in the lives of those around them. But there will be brightness at the end of all this when we come out the other side. Learning lessons from the past is one of the reasons why people study history. It is important that we see the positive things that will come about as a result. First, of course, is that the experience of Covid- should mean that we never find ourselves in this position again. Apart from better co-operation and sharing of information between states, we must learn to respond quicker and better than we did when the scale of the problem was already clear. In the UK, we did too little, too late. Our pain will save lives when something like this happens again – which it will. Second, and similarly, the problems the NHS has faced with a lack of ventilators, protective clothing and other supplies will mean that we stockpile and prepare better for the future. It is incredible to see Formula  teams work with universities to invent and start to produce breathing equipment in a matter of days but we need to invest better and more appropriately to be able to deal with crisis in the future.  Third, and comfortingly, hygiene standards in the UKshould improve dramatically. According to a Gallup poll conducted five years ago, only three quarters of Brits wash their hands after using the toilet.

Scientists at Kingaposs College London have been tracking symptoms via their specially-created app. By March , the Covid Symptom Tracker App had more than . million users sign up to log their symptoms, or lack thereof, daily. Some % of the . million people who had signed up by March  and tested positive reported a loss of smell and taste, compared with % of those who tested negative, analysis of the data showed. Researchers said the reports of those symptoms were much stronger in predicting a positive Covid- diagnosis than self-reported fever. The team behind the app has now created a model featuring a combination of symptoms, including loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite, and said the strongest predictor is loss of smell and taste. Commonly accepted symptoms of the respiratory disease include a fever, which NHS England says is usually a temperature of C or above, tiredness and a dry cough. Under current Government guidance people are advised to self-isolatethey have a new continuous cough and or high temperature. The World Health Organisationsays other symptoms can include shortness of breath, aches and pains, and a sore throat.  Some people have also reported a loss of taste and or smell, as well as abdominal pains. Last week the WHOaposs Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said there had been quite a few reports about people in the early stages of disease maybe losing sense of smell or taste.

While all non-esential shops are now closed and bars, pubs cafes and restaurants shut down, people have been urged to make sure they are socially distancing themselves from others. Groups of more than two, unless theyaposre members of your own home, are banned and people are being told to make sure they stay at least six feet from others. In a bid to slow the spread of Covid- people are also being told they can only leave homethey need to get essentials like food or medication, or for exercise once a day. It also means thousands of birthday parties for little ones have had to be cancelled. But former Disney princess Megan-Leigh Boatman is bringing joy to countless children by entertaining them over FaceTime.The -year-old from Basildon, Essex, was spurred into action when she saw a Facebook post by a heartbroken mother whose little girl was devastated because her fourth birthday party had to be cancelled.The beautician, who gave up her job as an entertainer due to ill health, wanted to help cheer them up so is offering to bring some magic to children’s special days during Covid- home isolation. Megan-Leigh wrote a post on Facebook to parents to explain what she was offering and itaposs now been shared more than , times, with more than  FaceTime calls booked in. She explained: With everything going on in the world right now, I’ve decided to dust off my tiara and do what I love most. Being a princess and making children smile. Tonight I see a mumaposs plea for a princess to FaceTime her daughter on her birthday. This little girl has had to cancel her birthday party twice because of the recent Covid- virus. I feel so sorry for the little girl but I’m extremely happy I’m able to brighten her birthday on Sunday. It got me thinking about all the other little children missing out on their birthday parties or even children feeling a little low and needing their spirits lted. So, If anyone is in need of a Princess FaceTime please message me as I would love to help as much as I can over the next few weeks months. All I ask for inis a small donation. Megan had previously worked as a Disney princess, where she would entertain children at birthday parties, but she was forced to give up her dream job due to ill health - and instead went to work in the beauty industry.She said: Everyone that knows me knows the last  months have been very hard for me due to ill health. I thought I’d be able to get back to work and a normal pain free le once I had surgery, but it has had to be postponed until things improve in the world. But I’m now able to do something I love from the comfort of my own home without causing too much strain and pain on myself. As running around after  children wasn’t doable, Megan said the fact she can offer this service and still make children happy while safely staying at home is amazing. She added: I’ve found it really tough being unable to work and have had to make a lot of le changing choices along the way. So I’m really excited to be able to run Princess FaceTime from the comfort of my own home.Megan started FaceTime calling and surprising children at the weekend after her post first went viral last Friday. She said one little girl was so impressed by her chat with Cinderella that she sent over a handwritten letter for Megan to respond to. The real-le princess said: Most of the children are talking about having to stay at home so I tell them I also have to stay at home in my castle to keep safe. I called a four-year-old little boy dressed as Elsa from Frozen and now he is going around telling his friends I’m his girlfriend while another little girl told me I am her best friend and she has invited me over for a tea party when the nasty virus has gone. Megan also spoke to a Disney fan who has been poorly with chicken pox and described her as so brave, sweet and loving every minute of her chat with Cinderella. Speaking about how happy her service is making children, Megan said: Their reactions have been amazing. They’ve all been so happy and the smiles on their faces really makes it so rewarding. One little girl showed me all her Lego creations and another askedI have to clean all my castle by myself. I’m really looking forward to the rest of the FaceTimes I’ve got booked in.Glad she is able to put her ‘rewarding’ job back to good use again, Megan said it felt great to put the wigs and costumes back on to do something positive during the coronavirus outbreak.She said: I’m overwhelmed with the reaction it has had. I wasn’t expecting it to spread as well as it has. It’s made me so happy and given me something to focus on during this awful time! I’m glad I can play a tiny part in spreading some happiness around.‘I only thought I’d have a few messages and be able to brighten up a few kidsapos days but, it’s gone crazy. I’m glad a small gesture like this can bring a lot of happiness. In just  hours, Megan had more than  messages about her offer to dress up as Ariel from Little Mermaid, Elsa from Frozen, Cinderella and more - scheduling  video calls over the next few weeks. She added: This will hopefully cheer up so many children. It’ll give them something magical to remember during this crisis. They’ll be able to tell all their family and friends about it and it will hopefully lt their spirits. Megan’s social media page now includes several excited reactions from little girls who were shocked and delighted to chat to their favourite princess.

Patients must give a swab sample taken from inside the mouth before the device creates a unique aposfingerprintapos spectrum representing a positive or negative result.

Iaposm not the type to sit back in a crisis, I like to take control, so itaposs quite tough to not be as involved as I was in the NHS, but I wanted to try to do something in a dferent way. The field of infrared spectroscopy has been used for a number of years in other areas of medicine, with previous studies showing the method can also be used in the diagnosis of oian cancer and Alzheimeraposs Disease.  That means the infrastructure put in place at a time of war will still be used in a time of peace, he said. Though medical tests normally have to undergo years of rigorous testing and meet strict regulations, the Government has loosened some requirements to allow potential tests and other research into the virus to progress more quickly to meet the speed of the pandemic. Prof Singh said that, with another study to be imminently published in the science journal aposNatureapos and partnership with at least one NHS trust expected to help develop the technology, it could be just days before they have tested enough samples to attest to the accuracy of their method. He said they hope to run the test alongside the typical method currently used to confirm their results. In a study of a thousand samples, weaposll run it alongside the current methods to make sure itaposs accurate, he said. With the regulatory process being sped up,you can prove you have a test that is reliable, which we will be able to do within three or four weeks, within a couple weeks we can be testing patients alongside regular tests.  Professor Francis Martin, Prof Singhaposs supervisor during his PhD at the University of Lancaster  years ago and his long-term mentor, said there had been a great interest in developing the interdisciplinary approach for a number of years. Itaposs using physics to solve a biological problem, and itaposs been used for a number of biological problems before in oncology and neurodegenerative diseases, and in this case virology in the diagnosis of COVID, he said. The good thing about this aposfingerprintapos measurement is that it is numerical data, an objective measurement which can be put into an algorithm. This allows in real time for the sample to be categorised and classied, soyou have developed an algorithm to distinguish between healthy versus infected, then you can saya sample is infected or uninfected. So itaposs a very powerful tool. Having discussed the new test with Prof Singh, Prof Martin noted that a similar test - using a sample of blood rather than saliva - could be used to testsomeone is immune to the disease by seeingthey have developed the antibodies specically produced by the body to fight Covid-.

The letter, published today, was written on behalf of the industry by Tracy De Groose, executive chair of Newsworks. It asks advertisers to remove blocklists from trusted UK news brands to ensure they can continue to fund quality British journalism at a time of national crisis.   Here is the letter in full: Dear Advertiser, These are challenging times for all of our businesses no matter the size, sector or region we operate in. However, working together we can help reduce the devastating impact of this virus. We are open and ready to support you, so please let us know how we can best do that for your people, your customers and your business. Across our own industry, our journalists are working harder than ever to ask the right questions and to deliver accurate information in the most helpful and accessible ways possible for their readers.

The -year-old single mum, who set up the Bagworth and Thornton Coronavirus Community Response Team earlier this month, said: “I am a strong person but I just stood there and cried. “I can’t believe anyone could do this. “There were leaflets advertising the response team in my back windows and everyone has seen me out and about in Thornton, Bagworth and Stanton under Bardon. No other car was damaged. “I think someone has deliberately targeted my car to try to stop me doing what I am doing. It is sick beyond belief. “All four tyres have holes in. It looks like someone has used a big screwdriver to inflict the damage. “My car broke down on Saturday so I had to leave it there. I had just delivered a shepherd’s pie to an old person in the village. “I called a friend and told him about my car breaking down. He said I could borrow his van to carry on my rounds as I had other food to deliver.” Helen, who has visited more than  people in the  days since she set up the volunteer group, worked until the evening on Saturday then went out the next morning. Helen said: As I drove past my car I saw that all four tyres were flat as a pancake. “I got out and I could clearly see the puncture marks in each tyre. That’s when I lost it.” A distraught Helen, a self-employed interior designer who is now jobless, filmed the damage to her tyres. In the footage she can be heard saying: “Do you know what  I’ve done two weeks of response work in these two villages and somebody has stabbed every single one of my tyres on a car that has broken down and that I need. “I hope you are proud of yourselves. £. I have just lost my business. Thanks a lot.” Shortly after the video was posted online, Thornton resident Matt Goddard set up a Gofundme appeal to pay for Helen’s tyres to be replaced.  He set a target of £ which was achieved within two hours. Matt, who is in a -day isolation at home with his we and child, is a firefighter with the Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service based at Lutterworth. Matt said: “This is terrible. Helen is amazing. “She has been delivering stuff to us and to my parents who are also in isolation in the village. “Any extra money raise will got to help the group carry on their great work looking after people and helping them in isolation.” Helen said she was touched by the response. Helen said: “I can’t thank the people enough. It is very humbling to know that, in these tough times, people have actually donated money to help me out.  “A horrible thing has happened but this just shows that the vast majority of people are good. “I want the person who slashed my tyres to know that I won’t be discouraged or beaten. They won’t win – together the whole community will win.” By pm today, the fund total had reached £,. Leicestershire Police have confirmed they are investigating the tyre slashing.

Baia is under lockdown, like the rest of Germany, and the hotel should be closed down along with all the others but it was apparently been given special permission to remain open for the king and his bizarre court. It is not knownthe kingaposs FOUR wives are among the group. King Vajiralongkorn has long been a controversial figure in Thailand, where it is banned from criticising the royal family, or even their pets. Despite the threat of  years in prison, he is criticised in his home country, albeit in private.

Nicolaides was later pardoned by the king and he said his book had been entirely fiction from cover to cover.Two years later, one of Vajiralongkornaposs royal planes was seized by German authorities as payment for a £million debt owed to a German firm, which was in danger of becoming bankrupt. Vajiralongkorn finally agreed to pay £million, which was then covered by the Thai government. He married his first we, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, in  and the couple welcomed their daughter, Princess Najrakitiyabha. However, during his first marriage, Vajiralongkorn embarked on an affair with actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth, with whom he had five children. Despite repeated requests, Princess Soamsawali refused to orce her husband until he finally got his wish in , claiming the fault of the marriageaposs failure lay squarely at his weaposs door. Even so, his first we and their daughter continue to play a major part in royal events. Vajiralongkorn, still a prince, then married the woman he had been having an affair with for more than  years - but their wedding was not blessed by the queen. Just two years after their marriage Yuvadhida moved to Britain with all of the coupleaposs children - the prince did not react well. He put posters up all around the palace, accusing his we of adultery and eventually abducted his daughter and brought her back to Thailand to live with him. She was later elevated to the rank of princess, but his we and their sons were stripped of their royal titles and they all now live in the US. His third we was Srirasmi Suwadee, who had worked for the prince since . The marriage was kept from the public for four years, finally been disclosed in . Srirasmi gave birth to the coupleaposs son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, in the same year and was made a princess by her husband, who vowed his wild days were behind him. But nine years later Vajiralongkorn demanded his weaposs family be stripped of their royal titles amid allegations of corruption among her relatives. His we relinquished her royal titles soon afterwards and agreed to a orce after  years of marriage after being awarded a £.million settlement. Just three days before he was crowned king, Vajiralongkorn married his fourth we, Suthida Tidjai, who was a former acting commander of Royal Thai Aide-de-Camp Department. However, despite once again being a married man Vajiralongkorn was still not faithful and just months after his wedding he gave his concubine Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi the title of Chao Khun Phra, which means royal noble consort. The -year-old had become the first royal consort in Thailand for almost a century in almost  years and meant she was an official companion to the king but not the queen.

We urge the international community to react and to take him to task for his systematic human rights violations.”Alexander A.

But in reality, when the state controls all of the media and all of the digital nodes coming in and out, itaposs not that outrageous.

Do you keep the players ticking over on their own or rest “The most important thing, though, is the health of everybody – as a club we are doing everything to look after our players and our staff, that’s paramount.“There’s not many times when I’ll say football isn’t important but it isn’t right now.”The Dundee players have been given inidual training programmes to work on at home but, with government advice to stay indoors as much as possible, it’s not easy for some.“As a club we have set up inidual programmes for the players but the trouble with that is a lot of the work is on treadmills or exercise bikes and not everyone has access to them,” added the Dens boss.“Otherwise you’re asking them to go out and do bits in the park and the advice is now not really to do that.

Looking back, that only makes the win all the more remarkable.For United, it was a far grander venue and harks back to the good old daysof regularly competing for big trophies.The  League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen was my first experience of covering a big club game at Hampden. It was a great day with a huge Tangerine following rewarded with an amazing comeback victory thanks to Callum Morris and Nadir Ctci headers.Everyone has their own favourites and this stoppage is a great time to reminisce – hopefully, we won’t have to do that for too long.Uefa are due to meet via video conference today to thrash out some sort of plan for sorting how the current season ends.I’m glad to hear that’s because it’s pretty much certain their initial hopes to get club football completed by the end of June won’t be coming to fruition.August seems to be the consensus and it sounds fair enough.What I expect to come out of this virtual get-together is some sort of rational plan to sort out player contracts and technical issues like that.That’s what Uefa is there for. What I don’t expect them to do is grant the SPFL’s wishes by making tough decisions on how to end this season.I can’t help but think Neil Doncasterand SFA chief Ian Maxwellare desperate for Uefa to make a sweeping decision so they can avoid any sort of responsibility when people moan.My gut feeling is the European chiefs will have a plan to get the campaign finished in the autumn and roll straight into the new one. I would dearly love our set-up to be restructured to bigger leagues, however.After watching the  Scottish Cup Final on Sunday it made me think ‘where have all the cup finals gone’ It’s been five long years since Dundee United were last in a major cup final and  for Dundee. The end of my first season at the Tele saw the Tangerines in the Scottish Cup Final and then the League Cup showpiece a year later.It just shows how quickly things can fall apart – thankfully, both seem to be putting the pieces back together.To keep me amused I’ve been watching the Leeds United documentary on Amazon.

Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":null,"title":"managing the coronavirus shut down has been my toughest test as dundee boss says james mcpake","story":"The first year as a manager brings all sorts of challenges but James McPake admits dealing with the coronavirus from a football point of view takes the biscuit.The Dundee boss has had plenty to deal with during his debut campaign, including heavy derby defeats, issues with the law and a restless home support.Pressure has always been a major part of the role and it was ramped up during poor spells in the first half of the Championship campaign.McPake has always had more experienced heads to turn to for advice throughout his time in charge, whether assistant manager Jimmy Nicholl, technical director Gordon Strachan or someone outside the club.The current complete shutdown of Scottish football, however, is completely unprecedented.“This is one I can’t go to anyone for advice,” admits Dens gaffer McPake.“Nobody has faced anything like this. For loads of other stuff you can get advice, going on bad runs, good runs, heavy defeats, good times.“My first year has been a challenge. I always expected it would be a challenge but there was no way of expecting this to happen as manager of Dundee.“I’ve got kids not able to get to school like everyone up and down the country, people can’t go to work or getting laid off.“It is a challenge for me but nothing likeis going on in the rest of the world.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53266067-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53266067-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53266067-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53266067-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"on this day the victorian trio who became dundees first scotland stars","story":"Today could have been the day where  years of hurt ended and Scotland finally secured its place at a major tournament again.Had they, as hoped, navigated a semi-final clash with Israel at Hampden last week, Scotland would have been in Norway or Serbia to play for a place in Euro .As it stands, none of that will happen tonight.Partly because it’s a hypothetical scenario but mainly because the coronavirus pandemic and shutdown of football has put paid to it.Those play-off clashes will now be played in June, at the earliest, with the finals themselves pushed back until next summer.Fortunately, today#s date also holds signicance historically for one of our city clubs.On March , , Dundee saw its first players earn Scots caps – three no less, in fact.Only an established club for less than a year, the Dark Blues had goalkeeper Francis Barrett, captain William Longair and winger Sandy Keillor all start for the national team against Ireland.Taking place at Cltonville’s Solitude ground in Belfast, nearly , spectators packed in as Scotland ran out - winners in a British International Championship match thanks to a Samuel Torrans own goal and John Taylor strike.Barret would go on to win just the one more cap for his country but wore the dark blue of Dundee with distinction  times.Born in Dundee on August ,  to Irish parents, he began his career at Dundee Harp – a club formed to try to emulate Celtic and Hibernian in providing a sporting focus for the catholic community in Scotland’s major cities.They had harboured ambitions to be the city’s top side before East End and Our Boys formed Dundee Football Club as we know it today in .In December of its first season, looking to bolster their back line, the Dee swooped for Harp keeper, Barrett.Their problems were clear for all to see as he became the fth goalkeeper the ‘Ten-bobbers’ used that season when he made his debut against Hearts on December .Barret remained at the club until the summer of  before signing for Newton Heath, now Manchester United, and went on to play against Dundee in a friendly – one of his  appearances for the Red Devils.Spells at New Brighton Tower, Manchester City and Aberdeen followed, before Barrett began to suffer from ill health, eventually passing away aged just  in .Hall of Fame inductee Longair, known as “Plum”, was a terric servant to Dundee – stretching back to the days of East End, for whom he signed in .The match against Ireland was Plum’s only cap in a career which also stopped in at Newton Heath as well as Sunderland, Burnley and Brighton United.Born in Dundee in , the centre-half would make  appearances for the Dee, scoring four goals and captaining the club in its first-ever fixture against Rangers in  – a - draw at West Craigie Park.Skippering the side is something Longair would do multiple times in his four spells until his retirement from playing in .He would go on to be the club’s trainer for their  Scottish Cup success and later become groundsman before his sad death aged just  in .It is estimated , people lined the streets for his funeral, showing the high regard in which the Dundonian public held him.Keillor was not only one of the first Dundee players to play for Scotland but also the first to score.Picking up four caps in total, the attacking talent also made  appearances for the Dark Blues, scoring  goals.Born in Dundee on October , , Keillor was brought up in Montrose and began his career with the Links Park side in .He joined the newly-formed Dundee FC in  with two Scotland caps already under his belt and, like Longair, played in the club’s first-ever match against Rangers.The outside-left was seen as a complete footballer with The Courier writing at the time that “he had a knack of rising to the big occasion”.And he did just that when Scotland hosted Wales at Dundee’s Carolina Port in , with Keillor getting his goal in a - win for the Scots.Keillor was awarded a testimonial against Celtic in , with , supporters turning up.He remained with the club until , playing at the new Dens Park alongside Longair, before ing to Montrose and hanging up his boots in .

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus claims 16 more lives in scotland","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe number of people in Scotland who have died from COVID- has risen to , the First Minister has announced.The coronavirus death toll rose by  on yesterday with confirmed cases now up to , from , yesterday.A total of  people are in intensive care as the virus accelerates, she said, although numbers are regarded as underestimate.In addition, she confirmed today that the popular Edinburgh Fringe Festival would not take place this summer, bringing to an end rumours it may happen on a much smaller scale.Addressing questions about the availability of ventilators in Scotland, Mrs Sturgeon said the Scottish Government #had a number# on order with overseas manufacturers.#Those orders will be delivered,they stay on track, over the period of the next number of weeks and by the summer,# she said.#It will take us to roundabout more than a thousand ventilators.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But, similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore, covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.As of Monday,March , the prime minister has put the UK into lockdown and instructed all citizens to stay at home.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

That could take the form of an industrial unit large enough to house the theatre rigging and studio equipment.ldquoShe and her financial partners must now consider the best way to ensure the old church building is not left to fall into disrepair and are in talks with East Lothian Council planning department considering appropriate conversion projects.ldquoSeparately, she is seeking a more appropriate space to run the dance and music school.ldquoShe hopes to find a place where drop-off and parking are easier for parents, especially in the winter months.Two of the flats would be accessed from the rear, with two upper flats accessed by the existing double doors at the front of the building."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-lockdown-rules-deemed-essential-travel---can-drive-somewhere-exercise-walk-dog","story":"Under new government guidance, people are allowed to go out once daily for exercise - but does this include driving to a beauty spot or park to run or walk your dog Here are the answers to some top questions.Can I drive to take my dog on a walk The current rules being enforced by the lockdown states that there are only four reasons you should be leaving your home:-One form of daily exercise - Shopping for essentials- Travelling to and from work- To fulfil medical needsNew government advice today addressesthe issue of driving further afield than where you live to take exercise.The guidancesays - please use the following guidance in order to stay safe:North Yorkshire Police have announced that they will be using checkpoints to stop vehicles and ask drivers where they are going.Assistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said: ldquoThe new and signicant restrictions announced by the Prime Minister on Monday evening spell out very clearly what each and every one of us must do to save lives.ldquoThe message is clear and the warning stark.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to

Those who commit themselves to months alone at sea in the name of le-changing moments, philanthropy and legacies.It was in  that The Sunday Times announced the award of a trophy, The Golden Globe, for the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world. The event was the first organised, non-stop race around the world for iniduals. Those attempting to make the journey had little understanding of how the experience would pan out or how their minds would cope with a year in isolation.The only sailor to complete and therefore win this first feat was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who crossed the finish line after  days alone at sea. Knox-Johnston once said: ldquoYou donrsquot really knowyour brain will stay sane. Your sense of humour is absolutely essential.Now a sailing legend, Knox-Johnston founded the famed Clipper Yacht Race, an event he started so that everyone who wanted it ldquocould have the opportunity to experience the challenge and sheer exhilaration of ocean racing.Sir Robin spoke on the current pandemic on his Twitter feed stating: ldquoBack from the Philippines, the crews now home and the boats sitting for the next - months by which time we hope this virus will be history.\"Now in self-imposed isolation for which my past has trained me perfectly. Look after yourselves everyone.A physical challenge on the surface, ocean racing is fundamentally a mental marathon. An endurance test for the mind to adapt in an ever-changing and high-risk environment.As the power and effect of the pandemic takes hold of the world, the constant change of climate and influx of data leads for new adaptions every day. This is an environment not dissimilar to the challenges faced by iniduals who take on these solo excursions.As a marine marketing agency, Gordon Ritchie, director of GRM Marketing, continues: ldquoDealing with offshore yacht racing and rowing can bring out the best in you. All of the small teams or iniduals are normal people doing extraordinary things.\"They are all well planned and determined. They all have a complete resolve to overcome any challenge placed in front of them and are determined to get to the start line ... that can be just as dficult as getting to the finish line where the risk lies mainly with the team or inidual.GRM is no stranger to supporting sailors and rowers making their way to the start line ready to embark on psychological journeys of self-isolation out at sea.The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is a -mile rowing race beginning in La Gomera in the Canary Islands and ending in Nelsonrsquos Harbour, Antigua. The race can take anything from a record-breaking  days to four, back-breaking months.This year, GRM supported two teams in this race named \"The Worldrsquos Toughest Row\", BROAR as they made their way to the start line and HMS Oardacious in PR during their final stages. In December, team HMS Oardacious became the fastest serving military team to cross the Atlantic and raised nearly pound, to provide mental health and wellbeing support to their submarine community for The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity. The charity aims to support personnel, veterans and families as they overcome challenges faced during and after service.Following the impact of the pandemic, mental health has arrived back at the forefront of many online and government discussions. With businesses facing collapse, iniduals facing job losses and with millions now confined to their homes, this pandemic is predicted to move from a physical crisis to a mental one.The anticipation of lockdown and self-isolation has been the anxiety-inducing issue facing iniduals worldwide as we adapt to this new normal. It will take a period of adjustment, but as in all situations and challenges we adapt, and can in time prosper.As serving submariners in the Royal Navy, HMS Oardacious shared their unique insight on self-isolation when embarking on the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.Lieutenant Hugo Mitchell-Heggs explained: ldquoAs a Royal Navy submariner we are well versed with spending extended periods of time deployed, isolated from society, our loved ones and what most would consider home comforts.He continued: ldquoSettling into a routine and being creative is fundamental to onersquos own wellbeing. Itrsquos never easy settling into a new pattern, and even for submariners, the first week at sea is often the most challenging.\"We also observed this on our ocean row, adapting to each other and our teamrsquos dynamic, to our new diet, safety culture and challenging environment. Twenty-foot waves and gale-force winds from day one was challenging, but with the right mindset we adapted and found ways to not just survive but also thrive.\"The benefits of a routine, and building things to look forward to in your day are a fundamental tactic for maintaining motivation and positivity while self-isolating.\"He said the value of a routine was that it \"provides structure to the working day, to the week and to the whole deployment patrol which can often go on for months on end\".\"Nutrition, exercise and mental stimulation are fundamental to thriving. During the ocean crossing, physical stimulation was aplentybut keeping our mental stimulation took being both creative and adaptable: audiobooks, podcasts, Christmas day karaokeand most importantly, conversation with our crew mates ndash whether it was jokes, banter or a lsquodeep and meaningfulrsquo while rowing under a moonlit sky.Upon speaking to Mitchell-Heggs and taking time to reflect, it becomes clear that in this period of crisis, we as a society have found great dficulty in the removal of the freedom to see those that we look forward to seeing, or the cancellation of events we look forward to experiencing. Holidays were the first to go, then events and gigs, now seeing friends and loved ones. What we now need to do is to find things in a simple day routine to look forward to.Your evening meal, your FaceTime to a friend, your weekly trip to the grocery store.

The concept of self-isolation, a once-unfamiliar term to the masses, has now become every inidualrsquos reality.In the coming months, we will see the effects of this new \"self-isolation\" and begin to understand the trials that sailors, rowers and explorers endure when taking on challenges that disconnect them physically from the outside world.Gordon Ritchie continues: ldquoIn the light of the Covid- outbreak we should consider that we are now at the start line and all we have to do is complete the challenge and get to the finish line.\"The common outcome is that everyone will have gained a lot from the journey, and be in a much better place when the champagne is uncorked.In this time, it is worthwhile to challenge yourself, try something new, learn something, donrsquot stagnate.\"If we can do it isolated in the middle of an ocean, anyone can do it from the luxurious comfort of their homes and with that constant connectivity, muses Lieutenant Mitchell-Heggs.How to beat isolation, by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston\"Isolation can be incredibly frustrating. But it does not have to be.\"People ask how did I manage  days alone at sea, but the answer is that I was constantly busy. I had a boat to sail, navigate , maintain, steer, plus feed myself. But in that lies the answer, create a project to focus the mind and pass the time.\"If you are a yachtsman, you can learn and practice your knots, or how to throw a line ashore. If you are a landsman, well those knots are always useful.\"Bear in mind I had no one to talk with. No communications at all for most of the time, so I had to think of things that would keep me mentally stimulated. I took to learning poetry. We have wonderful poetry in the English language, but anything that makes the mind work is good.\"Now many of us are staying at home with time on our hands, we could put the time to good use. It might amuse children as well.\"Knots are something many of us use daily so why not practice them, and learn a few new ones  It will keep those skills you have learned fresh for when you can get outside and for my Clipper Race Crew ndash when you re-join your boats next year.\"You have probably seen lines thrown from a boat that donrsquot cover the distance, or get tangled on their way. I suggest you go out into the garden with a rope and practice to develop this skill. A quick tip is to make two coils, not too large, and throw the smaller one allowing the larger one to unravel as the first one extends.\"Isolation is something we are going to have to get used to for the next few weeks. I had  days of it, but I had plenty to do during that period which made the time pass reasonably quickly. So there is the answer. Create a project to fill the time.\"I cannot get over to my boats where there is always something to do, so the garden furniture is getting sanded and re-painted and then I will have to face up to the long put-off job of sorting out everything in my Man Cave, apart from sorting out our new Clipper Race schedule, of course.\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-menu-make-store-cupboard-go","story":"Now, of course, the supermarket sweep has become something of an adrenalin sport, a Mad Max ldquodo or die dash to the chill cabinet and a frustrating game of hunt the pasta while giving fellow shoppers the death starethey stray too close while pushing potentially contaminated shopping trolleys with their elbows.Planning the family meals for the week ahead has come down to writing a shopping list, chucking it in the bin and hitting Tesco dressed head to toe in plastic to grab the last sad cans of green lentils and mushy peas.In a land of plenty where we expect our shopsrsquo shelves to heave with precisely what we want, is it now at all possible to eat well, healthily and preferably not starve And, should we actually feel brave enough to go shopping, what should we snap up to ensure we put decent food on the table Dr Gillian Purdon, head of nutrition science and policy at Food Standards Scotland, says: ldquoThis is a dficult period for people who may have not have access to their normal choice of foods.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   The Steph Show - just the tonic the lockdown troops need ","story":"Channel , noonALL hail television. It has brought the moon landing into our homes, allowed us to explore the world from sea to sky, enriched our souls and blown our tiny minds.Now here we are, in , and there is a woman on the screen wearing a cushion cover on her head. Like the man Lennon said, nobody told me there would be days like these.But thatrsquos the virus, The Thing, for you. No aspect of le remains untouched by it. Now it has given rise to a new strand of programmes, which for want of a yuckier phrase wersquoll call virus viewing. Among the first examples of this aired yesterday on, where , Channel .The Steph Show comes live from the home of presenter Steph McGovern. You know Steph. Yorkshire. Working class. Blonde. Gets on with everybody. The Aldi version of Clare Balding. She was due to start a conventional daytime chatshow soon, in a proper studio, and when all this is over, and there are blue birds over the white clfs of Dover, she will get that. For now, though, Steph is stuck at home like the rest of us, so why not do the show right there There she was, broadcasting live ldquofrom my actual house, where she lives with her five-month-old baby. We did not glimpse young McGovern on this occasion, but we did see the -strong Hann family from Dundee, Strictlyrsquos Anton du Beke, the comedian Keith Lemon and others, all beamed in from their homes courtesy of the internet. Otherwise, the production team were in Stephrsquos garage, the sound man was outside, and everyone was the regulation two metres apart.The interview with the Hann family exposed one of the pitfalls of this kind of Blue Peter, sticky back plastic programme making in that the sound was too low and the signal kept breaking up. While other interviews were clearer they were interrupted by screen freezes and phone pings. The odd instance of such things happening might be considered charmingly ramshackle too much will be just plain annoying.The content, including a money management section and a fitness routine, must have taken a whole five minutes to think up. There were local radio style ldquoshout outs to the ious heroes and heroines of the virus crisis, including a GP and a chap who had helped stock a food bank. In the middle of the show was a Channel  news bulletin with Cathy Newman. The smoothness and conventionality of this segment made The Steph Show look even more thrown together when we switched back.It was, as McGovern herself said, a bit rough round the edges. ldquoThatrsquos how Irsquove been described for most of my career, she joked. McGovern is too modest. Thatrsquos one of her many charms. The only reason the show stayed together, and remained watchable, was her. She could think on her feet, she was good with the guests, and she did not stop rabbiting for a second ndash all essential qualities for a presenter of a live show. She could have a giggle, too, as when she and Lemon were trying out ideas for masks and she put a cushion cover over her face. You would never catch Fiona Bruce doing that.At times the chat descended to the depths of banality, as when Lemon told us that he had hot dogs for dinner the previous evening. ldquoSo did I! shrieked McGovern asit was the most fascinating coincidence ever.Oh, and it turned out that Lemonrsquos we had the same jumper as McGovern. Gripping stuff, eh  This is going to be a tough gig to do day after day. By day five the format might have found its groove, or jumped the tracks entirely.Much of the interest lay in seeing what other peoplersquos homes were like. McGovernrsquos was modern, sleek, all John Lewis cushions and fresh flowers. Everything looked brand new. Du Beke had curtains that were as gaudy as some of his Strictly costumes, while Lemon appeared to live at the bottom of a well.The hour flew by in a rush of silliness.

A critical constraint on the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity is the availability of the chemical reagents which are necessary in the testing.ldquoThe Prime Minister and the Health Secretary are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds.Critics of the Government have denounced its efforts on testing, comparing them to the governmentrsquos in Germany, where , tests are being carried out every week.In a letter to Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The phenomenal public outpouring of support for our NHS workers needs to be matched by Government action.As well as asking why so many frontline staff were still without personal protective equipment, the Labour leader said \"testing and tracing for coronavirus has to be expanded immediately\" with tests for NHS staff especially urgent so those given the all-clear couldto work.Mr Corbyn also warned the lack of testing for social care workers was \"risking their health and that of those they care for, who are the most vulnerable to the virus\".As coronavirus cases grew by their largest number in a single day, almost , Stephen Powis, the Medical Director of NHS England, suggested at the press conference progress was, nonetheless, being made as new cases appeared to be reaching a plateau.\"It is really important not to read too much[into the figures] because it is really early days.

We had a strict cleaning policy in the studio. We tried to keep going with the class and keep ahead of things, but it just ended up being a bit of a roller coaster, said Mrs Black.ldquoI think self-employed instructors were able to move faster as we are a bit more nimble in how we could react compared to some gyms. More and more clients were cancelling. So I knew things had to change.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Police handed powers to issue on-the-spot finesMrs Black linked up with a local video maker and recorded a series of classes which could be posted online.ldquoOnline videos was one answer and would certainly work for some exercise instructors, but with pilates I really needed to see people and be able to give them instruction and make corrections. That is when I thought online  Zoom would work as it meant I could run live classes.ldquoI am not able to run the full number of classes as some of my clients are older and it would require face to face instruction which obviously canrsquot be done at the moment. However we have adapted and so far the feedback has been very positive.A number of instructors have been offering classes online including fitness guru Joe Wicks who has been running a daily  minute work out for people to join. While there are a number of restrictions in place during lockdown.Mrs Black added: ldquo One of the most important things just now is ways of keeping connected. It is so shocking to be in this situation and we need things that bring us together and exercise can do that.ldquoMy mantra is enjoy good health and I have be using that to build an online network of people who want to live healthier.

Many of our amazing regular local participants from our real le Bishopton class are coming, along with people from my Houston and Neilston ones. Its lovely to see them turning up and they can see each other toothey want to.ldquoIts a lot better than I thought - it does still give some of the community feel and solidarity of the real le classes and it keeps us all sane - and sweating and shaking until we can go back to reality.

But the assistant, revealing the wisdom, command and common sense of Portia, politely insisted the selfish imbecile pick up the tissue.

As a result, we’ve had to take the decision to focus our efforts on the collection and disposal of household and commercial waste, while suspending our recycling services.”The following changes will be made:Mr Richardson added: “In normal times, we greatly appreciate the efforts people make to recycle a wide range of household and commercial items. But these are far from normal times, which is why we’ve had to make the dficult decision to suspend our recycling services.“We are not the only Council making this move, and we understand that  of the  local authorities across Scotland are also working on revised arrangements.“We are asking folkat all possible to store their recycling until these services can begin again. We’re aware that this won’t be an option for everyone, but we would ask that recyclable items are only included as a last resort on grey bin collection days.”He added: “People will be disappointed, and we apologise for the inconvenience these measures will cause. But in these unprecedented times, there is a need to ensure we can continue with the most essential operations with a limited workforce during the weeks and months ahead.“We ask all businesses and householders to be considerate during this time and to make every effort to minimise the waste that is put out for collection, bearing in mind that higher than normal volumes can cause delays and missed collections for other households and businesses.“We are extremely grateful for your co-operation during this dficult period and also for the efforts of our office and depot staff, crews and drivers, who are already going above and beyond in providing vital waste collection services under extremely challenging conditions.”Any further changes will be announced through local media, on the Council website and using OIC’s social media channels.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation.The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  Covid- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic. The peak number of Covid- hospital admissions would be  per week.Under this reasonable worst case scenario, the projected number of cumulative Covid- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,.The modelling indicates that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic is expected between - April .The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced.

However that earned a rebuke from Environment Minister Edwin Poots who said the council had a legal responsibility to collect the bins.On Sunday the council rowed back saying it would collect brown bins for food and garden waste and on Tuesday announced all bins would be collected.A spokesperson said the matter was at all times under review and new measures had been put in place to allow the council to offer as near a normal waste collection service as possible in the current unprecedented circumstances.Belfast Lord Mayor Councillor Daniel Baker paid tribute to frontline staff who have been working to overcome operational challenges to ensure delivery of a waste collection service for residents.Councillor Baker added: “We continue to review our service delivery daily and following the introduction of additional measures to enhance the protection of our refuse collectors, we are now in a position to deliver as near a normal waste collection service as possible in the current unprecedented circumstances. From Wednesday, April , normal collections will resume for black, brown and blue bins across the city.“We must emphasise, however, that given the size and scale of Belfast’s waste collection service, the situation remains challenging, and our entire operation remains under daily review and is dependent on the ongoing impact of Covid on our own employees.”Belfast City Council serves the largest geographical area out of all the  councils in Northern Ireland and has the largest population.Councillor Baker added: “Delivering our waste collection service has been possible due to staff from across the organisation being trained and redeployed to our frontline services. We have also fitted special screens in our bin lorry cabs to allow staff to practice social distancing, as directed by the government guidelines.“We would like to thank residents for their continued support and patience as we try to minimise service disruption in these most challenging of circumstances.“We would also ask thatpossible, please share this update with neighbours who may not be online, either by text or phonecall – particularly those who are older or more vulnerable.”Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus meet northern irelands key workers sacrificing their home lives for us","story":"Testing times: Ruth McGreevy in the Ulster HospitalThe Airbnb Ruth’s staying in with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Close family: Ruthwith her mum and sistersForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner GarethBetter times: Rab McCoy with we Tanya and their children Robbie and Rachel FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappTesting times: Ruth McGreevy in the Ulster HospitalBy Linda StewartMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIn times of crisis all we want is to be with our family, but for those with vital roles during the coronavirus pandemic, this poses a great risk. Linda Stewart speaks to three frontline staff who are staying away from their dwellings to protect their loved ones.The AE nurseAE nurse Ruth McGreevy , from Newtownards, has moved into an Airbnb accommodation in Bangor in order to protect her mum and siblings who fall under the high risk category. Her boyfriend is Philip , a computer technicianAE nurse Ruth McGreevy has had fond memories of the Ulster Hospital since childhood when she was a frequent visitor due to her asthma.Now on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus, the -year-old from Newtownards is poised for the toughest battle of her le as the hospital prepares for a flood of patients hit by coronavirus.Although patients infected with Covid- have already started to appear at the Ulster Hospital - and there have been some deaths - there is still a sense that it is the calm before the storm.We shut down a bit of the AE to cater for people coming in, where we could call people in and treat them, send them to the ward or send them home. And then the past couple of weeks we#ve been closing off more and more of the AE, Ruth says.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home Ruth McGreevy, nurseObviously, the doctors and the managers are concerned that it#s coming because they#re shutting it down and we#re getting more in-depth training on how to deal with the really sick patients that come in. So it#s a bit scarier now that all this is taking place - everyone#s on tenterhooks just waiting for this to hit.All the wards have been emptied out to deal with this when it arrives and it#s quite bizarre lately going to the ward and seeing lots of empty beds, because that hasn#t happened in years.The staff have been getting special training in the personal protection they will wear, including masks, aprons and gloves.And then there are things like infection control, how to stop the spread. We#re learning how to work ventilators and respiratory equipment, Ruth says.That#s quite daunting - nurses generally wouldn#t really be doing much of that, but now we#re being taught it just in case we get into the circumstances where we might have to use them.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home.We all have families at home and sick people and children and things. You#re so scared of walking it back into your house, because you never know what will happen. You hear of people getting younger and younger with no medical history who are dying from this, so it#s scary.Ruth has a long association with the Ulster Hospital - she was born prematurely and had bad asthma when she was young, and spent a lot of time in the hospital.I just had lots of admissions with my chest as I had quite a lot of asthma attacks, so I was just in and out with that into Maynard Ward. They were always so nice and kind and my sister Eleanor was quite unwell as a child, so we spent a lot of time visiting her when I was little - I was just always around hospitals.It was this early experience that spurred her to become a nurse.I was struck with just how much a bit of kindness can do for someone, Ruth says.You can be so unwell and someone just giving you a nice smile or being kind - the smallest gesture can go a long way. Making someone a cup of tea sometimes goes a lot further than any other medication you can give them. with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Close family: Ruthwith her mum and sisters FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappClose family: Ruthwith her mum and sistersAfter leaving school, Ruth went to Queen#s University Belfast and worked as a healthcare assistant while studying to be a nurse. She is now an adult-trained AE nurse in the Ulster Hospital.Basically, it#s people walking in unwell, so it#s like doing bloods and ECGs, trying to figure out what#s wrong with people. Lately, I#ve been dealing with cardiac arrests and things like that, dealing with car accidents.Ruth lives with her mum Belleand sisters Sarah , Eleanorand Kirsty .In the past week she has been forced to make the dficult decision to move away from her family in order to protect them from the danger of infection.I#m the youngest, and I didn#t want to do it but my mum is , and she#s diabetic and has high blood pressure, Ruth says.My oldest brother Alex recently had four strokes and he was on chemotherapy treatment with quite an unusual disease that he has - nobody#s really heard of it. So he#s on chemotherapy and he would have quite a low immune system. My sister Eleanor has MS and my sister Kirsty is on immunosuppressant drugs for a stomach problem. I feel like a walking super-virus going into my house.I was thinking about it for a few weeks but I hadn#t really talked to my mum about it - I didn#t want to bring it up until I thought it was really necessary.But in the last week especially I noticed that a lot of the patients I#ve been looking after had been going off to the ward and were taken very unwell or there were people passing away. So, in my eyes I could see it escalating quite a lot and I felt like it was time to go. Ruth says her family was very upset that she had to move out. She was the youngest and had never been away from home for a long period of time.I#m only moving to Bangor - it#s not far but it#s more that I can#t come into the house and have a proper conversation with them, she says.My mum was very upset about it - she#s just worried. She keeps saying she might not see me again.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRuth with boyfriend Philip Ferguson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRuth with boyfriend Philip FergusonRuth keeps in touch with her family and her boyfriend Philip , a computer technician, using video chat.I haven#t seen him in a month, she says.Along with another nursing colleague, Ruth has moved into an Airbnb accommodation at Gray#s Hill in Bangor thanks to the generosity of the couple who own it.They#ve given us the use of their house completely rent-free which is amazing - it#s so kind, she says.The kindness we#ve been shown at the moment is immense - like every day there#s more things being sent off to us. We#ll keep laughing, saying we#ll be rolling out of here after coronavirus because people are feeding us so much.We#re getting pizzas and doughnuts, and a big coffee van was up the other day giving everyone free coffee and sandwiches and everything. People are donating hand creams because we#ve washed our hands until they#re cracking and bleeding - people are giving us everything.The toughest thing just at the moment is all the new training, Ruth says.They#re saying things are going to get a lot harder for us because obviously this disease is airborne, so it#s when we go into the big proper masks that it will be scary.You#re just aware that you can#t take them off, she says.It#s just the fear in people#s eyes because they#re not allowed any visitors. So it#s trying to comfort those people - they#re so unwell and scared, and they can#t have anyone in their family with them.All you can do is just try and be as kind and caring as you can, staying with them, explaining why it#s happening, why their family can#t come in, we#ll look after them the best we can. It#s just being there to hold their hands when they need it.Ruth pays tribute to all the staff who are doing their bit to combat the disease.It takes an army in here, she says.To move a single patient to the ward, the whole corridor has to close because obviously people can#t walk into the corridor when you#re moving - so the amount of porters it takes and then the whole area has to be cleaned after one patient moves. The amount of people it takes to move one person is crazy. And you couldn#t do it without everybody - the teamwork going on at the minute is amazing.I know the Down AE has closed, so the staff from the Down AE have just come up today to the Ulster. So that#s extra doctors and extra nurses coming up, which is great.Ruth says the whole thing is very scary but the key thing is to try to keep positive.It#s all going to be over soon hopefully andwe all just do as we#re told it will be over sooner rather than later, hopefully, and we#ll come out the other side, she says.It really does prove how great everybody is that works for the NHS, not just nurses. We#re being supported at the minute, but it really isn#t just us - it#s everybody. It#s amazing seeing everyone pulling together.The social workerSocial worker Maria McNamee , from Londonderry, has moved in with a friend in Castlefin, Donegal, because she is concerned about putting her partner Gareth at riskI live with my partner of  or  years - it#s just me and him, she says.He has two of the conditions that put him at a really high risk - he has type one diabetes and is on immunosuppressants for Crohn#s disease. Each one of those would have put him in the at-risk category but the two together complicate things a bit more.Over the weekend the couple discussed the risk and made the dficult decision that Maria should move out.Because I#m still working and I#m out and about in contact with people, we decided the risk was too high, she says.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner Gareth FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner GarethEven before I moved out we were practising a bit of social distancing at home - we had moved into separate rooms and we stayed in separate parts of the house.I really thought we could just continue to do that - we didn#t go out with friends, we didn#t have people calling.We genuinely thought this would have been OK but the more we learned about the virus and how it is transmitted, it was like a bang at the weekend.The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment Maria McNamee, social workerIt was a really tough thing to do and we just felt it had to be done.We made the decision over the weekend and I packed my bags and left for work on Monday morning, not toreally. The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment.It#s a bit hard for us doing it - I can#t even imagine what it#s likeyou have children.Maria has moved in with a friend in Castlefin and works from home quite a lot, but there are still days when she has to go to the office or carry out home visits.Even though the rest of my family are living locally I#m still not seeing them either, she says.As a social worker with the looked-after children service, much of Maria#s work involves visits to children, families and foster parents.We#ve stepped some of that down but we#re doing a lot of phone support and there are still children that we need to visit, she says.It#s a tough job, so when you don#t have your own home comforts around you and your own routine of what you do, it#s really tough.This is the start of it - it#s been okay and it#s a lovely place, but I can only imagine when you#re two, three, four weeks down the line, and that#s only the start of it.I think there#s a real sense of people getting on with it and you are having to dig deep - I think everybody is doing it. I am so lucky with what I have here - for others out there, it must be so hard for them.The paramedicParamedic Rab McCoy , from Coleraine, has moved into a BB to protect vulnerable family members from infection. He is married to Tanya and has two children, Robbieand Rachel It was really from a personal point of view - there were a couple of things, he says.It was a matter of timing for me, trying to gauge the timing for this curve that is talked about in the news.I realised early on that I couldn#t work from home.My we had had a couple of bouts of cancer and had undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy and had her spleen removed, so it was a decision we talked about. It was a no-brainer.The paramedic was granted a period of emergency leave by the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in order for him to prepare his family for his absence - including his elderly mother-in-law and his brother, who lives in semi-sheltered accommodation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBetter times: Rab McCoy with we Tanya and their children Robbie and Rachel FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBetter times: Rab McCoy with we Tanya and their children Robbie and RachelI cleared all that up and that allowed me the time to prepare for stepping out of the home setting for an extended period of time.

Rhys was told he could not leave for at least  days.This means he has been unable to take a seat on repatriation flights being arranged by the British and Irish governments.Rhys said he fears the quarantine will be extendedthere are any new cases.He called on both governments to negotiate his release with the Peruvian authorities.Rhys spends  hours a day in his room and is only allowed to leave for meals that he likens to prison food.We currently have the military on the door and the police are barricading the street at the other end, he said.We#ve been put on government rations, so the meals have taken a big hit. A couple of nights we haven#t had dinner. Guests have been told they could face a prison sentence of five to  yearsthey try to leave without permission.The announcement we got in the hostel is that the quarantine can be anything from  days to three months, Rhys said.Kate Harrison, the British Ambassador for Peru, said on Twitter it would be  days, but she#s had a huge backlash because she hasn#t claried what the  days means.From what we understand, it means  days from when a new case is reported. Two new cases were confirmed on Monday, so that#s another  days for us already.Originally, around  travellers were in the hostel, with around  from other countries securing flights home before the lockdown was announced.The other night the military stormed the hostel and basically had a list of people to bring to another hostel, Rhys said.No one knew what was going on, but they eventually told the hostel manager that  people had to pack their stuff and be disinfected.It was like a sci-fi movie where people are getting sprayed down. Their clothes were completely ruined because it wasn#t basic alcohol they were using to spray people.At the start people were happy and had that optimistic backpacker mentality. But when the two people tested positive and we had to go back to our rooms, guests started crying because it looked like we were going to be here for at least a month.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign office said: We continue to work around the clock to help British travellers struggling to get back to the UK and we thank the Peruvian government for all their support in making this happen.It is understood the Peruvian government has insisted the -day quarantine at the hostel cannot be overturned, but efforts to bring those affected home continue.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusRussia confirms  new overnight cases as it ramps up testing capacity by over %Russia registered  new confirmed cases of coronavirus overnight yesterday in the steepest rise on record.

At first it may have seemed a bit like we needed to plan for the kids asit were a school holiday, but the level of social distancing required has meant that few of the things we normally do during holiday times are feasible. The fact that we must currently forbid social gatherings for our children may also be provoking some nervousness for parents, as we worry that all of this isolation may impact on our children#s sociability and the social and emotional development that is usually promoted by hanging out with, and playing with, their friends.Evenwe arrange to go for walks and come across other families we know, we have to keep at a distance that prevents the usual running around, hugging, tumbling, or horseplay that might occur in their play together. So, in their play, they won#t have any of the usual physical closeness that they might have enjoyed with friends.There is no doubt that the next whilewill be testing for children as they will miss out on lots of social interaction with their peers that they would normally have had. No birthday parties, no sleepovers, no playdates, no knocking for friends, no organised sports. It feels like a very signicant loss.I never thought I#d see myself write this, but suddenly technology and social media has real value for our social communication. While it is a dferent form of social connection, it does now play an increasingly important role in allowing our children and teenagers to stay in touch with friends, while maintaining the social distance needed to slow the spread of Covid-.While there is no doubt that this new social etiquette will impact on how we and our children can physically connect with our friends and extended family, the social distancing that we must practise, doesn#t have to lead to an emotional distancing or disrupt children#s emotional development.It is still really important, unless you are feeling unwell or need to socially isolate , that we maintain physical closeness in our families. Our children still need a loving touch from their parents. They need hugs, foot rubs and cuddles. Touch is such an important part of our social experience that our children cannot do without it for months. While our children may not be able to play with their friends, we can still promote their emotional development. In fact,we are all thrown together at home for extended periods there is more opportunity than ever to help children to learn about their feelings, to express those feelings and to process them healthily.Empathy is the mechanism by which we help children to develop emotionally. Le will provide children with the experiences that will provoke emotions. Our job is to help them to make sense of those emotions. The best way to understand what I am talking about might be for me to explain using an example. Let#s imagine you have a nine-year-old son, who is, by now, bored with being at home, restless, and perhaps cross that he can#t meet his friends. If he comes to you pleading, again, to be allowed to at least meet his friend just for a few minutes, many of us may have lost patience and may end snapping back at him, that he just can#t and to stop moaning, stop asking, let it go. While this is a natural response to our own frustration and stress of trying to manage the strange circumstances we find ourselves in, it does little to help our son deal with his feelings.If we can manage to regulate our frustration, a better response is to say something like: You sound really desperate to be able to see your friend. I#m guessing it is really disappointing that we have to keep apart from people we want to spend time with. You may be really cross that this virus seems to be spoiling our lives.There are a few things to notice about this response. The first is that we haven#t asked any questions about his feelings. This is because he is only nine and so he may feel put on the spotwe ask questions. If he doesn#t know how he feels, he may actually get more frustrated by being probed, since he will experience the social expectation that he should reply.Secondly, we don#t assume to know how our son is feeling. We are just guessing how he feels. So the you sound desperate... and you may be really cross... are phrased as statements and, importantly, they leave room for us to be wrong.A third thing to notice is that the statements don#t try to fix the problem created by social distancing, they simply recognise and help the child to identy, more accurately, the feelings it may create. A fourth thing you may have spotted is that the phrasing not only tries to guess at his feelings, but it also tries to guess at what may be generating those feelings . Sometimes we can be reluctant to do this, fearing that we may put ideas in their heads. However, we usually are very attuned to our children andthe thoughts are likely to be there already then it is very helpful for us, adults, to name those thoughts and feelings. If we are wrong, children still value the fact that we are trying to understand and may then be able to verbalise their actual feelings or thoughts, knowing that we have opened the door to these kinds of important conversations.There are no easy solutions to the problems or frustrations that our new way of interacting creates. But helping children to understand and voice their feelings will also help them to develop socially and emotionally.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: NI AssemblyMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA DUP MLA has claimed republicans have intimidated businesses into closing during the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking in the Assembly, Paul Frew told Finance Minister Conor Murphy he was concerned when he heard that businesses in the manufacturing industry were being put under pressure to close by people including Sinn Fein activists. I am deeply worried when I hear reports of intimidation by republicans and party activists of his [Conor Murphy#s] party of businesses, employers and CEOs of manufacturing plants who are striving to stay open - who this Assembly may well call upon to redirect resources and make things for us that will save lives.I#m deeply worried that I have heard reports of party activists from his party intimidating and harassing businesses to close completely, he said. It comes after Portadown-based business Ulster Carpets said it is to run down some of its operations after they claimed threats were made against employees. The business found itself thrust into the limelight for continuing to work on during the coronavirus outbreak but stressed it had at all times followed official government advice. Ulster Carpets said it had been very disappointed by some of the ill-informed commentary used against the company.We would request that this would cease as it has created an atmosphere in which abuse and threats have been issued against many of our employees, a company spokesman said.Mr Murphy said the claims of Sinn Fein activists targeting businesses were without substance.Of courseyou#re aware of accusations which are essentially of criminal behaviour, you have an obligation to report those to the police and I hope you have rather than simply bring them here for publicity purposes, he said.

Three days later, Corona Girl was finished and last Sunday we posted her on Facebook asking people to make bids through private message through the Zebra collectables Facebook page or telephone and whoever has bid the most by Sunday, April , will get her. We will use the money to get PPE to local places - some of whom have little or nothing and while this might not be as much as they need, it will be better than nothing.We will courier Corona Girl to whoever ends up getting her and because it has been nished she can be wiped down and disinfected.Mr Patterson saidCorona Girl garners plenty of interest he will consider making a Corona Boy that he will also auction off.He said: It is just my we and myself here now and she is keeping herself busy making hospital scrubs on her sewing machine so we are like the rest of the country - we are trying to do whatever we can to help those that need it.Belfast Most ReadDUP MLA claims republicans are intimidating businesses into coronavirus closure Arrest after disturbance at Belfast shopDetectives investigating ferry bomb plot seize vehicle, phones and clothingNorthern Ireland TalkTalk hack teen loses court battle over anonymityFamily-owned Newry business thank public for #uplting# support after armed robbery,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Likewisestart upsand new tech companies will never get it as they have no profit history, indeed some no revenue yet!Clearly the banks are not keen on these loans. They would rather encourage customers to take a regular product, on which of course they can charge fees as opposed to the CBLS.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

[ Ghanaian Cedi equals . Euro.]“We also paid for Precious to have her hair re-braided. Precious is the only girl in the orphanage to have long hair as she originally came from South Africa. “We then used the rest of the money to buy ice cream, crackers, pineapple and other treats for the children from day to day.”Acknowledging everyone who helped in her mammoth fundraising effort, Lauren thanked her family and friends especially.She added: “I would also like to thank Fr Mailey in Drung Quigleys Point Community Centre Sainsbury’s in Derry and Debbie, who is the manager of Lidl in Buncrana. “That is not forgetting anyone who helped out in any way at fundraisers, by donating prizes or coming along to events. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Even the smallest donation made a huge dference in Ghana.”An average day in Ghana for Lauren began at .am.She reaclled: “We usually arrived at Beckys Orphanage at .pm r .pm, depending on the taxis. We stayed about a  minute drive away from the orphanage.“When we arrived, we helped to get the children ready for school and had morning cuddles with the younger children. We went on the school bus with the children. “There were about  children, four volunteers and our the driver squashed on a  seater bus but we made it work.“When we dropped the children off, we went back for breakfast, then back to the school, where could had the choice of watching the children in the daycare or teaching a class,we wanted. At .pm, we went back for lunch and rested until pm. “Then it was back to school to get the children onto the bus and back to the home. Because their own bus was broken down, we had to rely on taxi buses from the village, which were not always readily available when we needed them. For a few days, we had to wait to pm for one to arrive.”But it did not stop there. Back at the orphanage, it was homework, with the younger children playing or watching TV.Lauren said: “The older children usually helped with cooking dinner. I tried to help one day but it was the hardest thing. They cook in an outside hut. “They light a fire in an old wheel alloy and cook in a huge pot. If the heat doesn’t get to you, the smoke in your eyes will. It wasn’t the easiest dinner I ever helped cook.“We usually left the orphanage around .pm but a few evenings we were lucky and the taxi was late so we could stay longer.“Volunteer safety was paramount at Becky’s, so when the mosquitos came out, we went in. Back at the volunteer house, we could have dinner, get cleaned up and then the night was our own.“We never ventured out much at night because of the mosquitos as well as the power cuts. The whole village would be in darkness. It would be very dficult to navigate your way.”Lauren described her trip to Ghana as the most amazing experience. googletag.cmd.push She said: “At first it was dficult, seeing some sights was hard. “What people live in, children on the street in rags, being sent to school with no breakfast or lunch. The children from Becky’s Orphanage are lucky as they will at least get their three meals a day.“People with no running water and power that would often go off also took a bit of getting used to. Although, washing from a bucket of cold water did become something I looked forward to and was quite refreshing.“Being able to see the joy from the children when you came to see them at the school and orphanage, how a small piece of pineapple brightened their day and even just the enjoyment they would get from sitting beside you, would melt your heart.“Of course, with the money we raised, we were able to do a lot for the children, but what we left with was so much more.“We have learned how to appreciate the simple things in le to be grateful for everything we have here at home and to never take anything for granted here,” added Lauren. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Trust would like members of the public to snap images of a tree or flower in bloom from their window, in their garden or during their daily permitted exercise and to share their images on social media.The move is part of the Trust’s campaign to help people of all ages to become more connected with everyday nature. The charity said that blossom sweeping the country is one of nature’s key moments that could help lt the spirits during these uncertain times and enable people to celebrate nature and history together. It is asking those with trees and flowers in bloom in their gardens and on their streets to share pictures on social media using #BlossomWatch and tagging their location, so everyone can enjoy this year’s blossom season. And next year there are plans to develop a #BlossomWatch map.The move follows the launch of the Trust’s Noticing Nature report last month, which demonstrated that for people to do more to protect nature, they need to have a closer everyday connection to it. Only six per cent of adults and seven per cent of children celebrate natural events such as the first day of spring, solstice or harvest, according to the Trust’s recent research.Andy Beer, nature expert at the National Trust says: “It’s really easy to take this moment in nature for granted. Celebrating blossom is a pivotal, seasonal moment that can often be all too fleeting and we want to do all we can to help people and families at home to enjoy and take stock of a special moment in the calendar.“At a time when people are being asked not to travel, we want people to notice the blossom on their doorstep – in their garden, on city streets or in public parks when taking the permitted daily walk, cycle or run. We’re asking them to take pictures of the blossom as it blooms and share the joy with others who can’t see blossom for themselves right now.“The success of blossom and the subsequent fruiting is highly dependent on the weather, which could be affected in future years by the warming climate.”The Trust will be encouraging those who’d like to get involved to share and tag their images via @NationalTrustNI on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using the #BlossomWatch and also inserting the name of the place where they live.

cook everything, not just heating beans in a microwave or a boiling an egg but proper gravy with stock and cornflour.So wondering what to do with your children this week. … there’s your answer.Mum also said that meal times were much more family times, when everyone would come together, sit together and talk, sounds great to me.We are all so busy now that I wonder, when did you last sit at the table together and talk - so another good point.What about home grown food too - we used to eat a lot of this but as le has got busier this skill seems to have faded away, is this the perfect time to order seeds or shoots to plant and grow potatoes, peas, beetroot, onions, peppers or tomatoes  I remember my mum teaching me the games she used to play, so why not teach your children too - great excuse to turn the TV or computer off and play.What about Pick Up Sticks, Cat’s Cradle, Marbles, Jacks, Dominos and Cascading Dominos, or card games such as Chase The Ace, Cheat or the Matching Memory Game or even building with the cards.For outside, what about Hop Scotch, skipping rhymes and games with a skipping rope or two tennis balls against a wall - A Sailor Went To See See See, To See What He Could See, See See .. the song went on and you had to do the actions whilst still throwing and catching the two balls.Or another, sing “Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, next door neighbour carry on” and your friend would move in catching and throwing the balls without breaking the rhythm.Or try clapping games together like Say Say My Playmate.Or making obstacle courses or dens - children of any age love dens especiallythey can have lunch in there too.And do you remember making perfume from flower petals or paper mache Or on wet days what about learning to knit, or do knitting dolly, sew, crochet or even try tongue twisters, Betty Botter bought some butter but she said this butters bitter,I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter, so she bought a bit of butter better than the bitter butter and she put it in her batter and her batter was not bitter, so twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter .Don’t forget the board games too like Cludo or Mouse Trap, Ludo or Snakes And Ladders - maybe you could make the boards yourselves too!In the olden days we used to write to each other too - not email, text, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram!So why not encourage, or help, your child to discover the enjoyment of writing and receiving letters They could write about the fun you’ve been having whilst you are offand maybe include a picture they’ve done, then pop it in the post to their friends, grandparents or other family members We used to get pocket money for ‘jobs’ we did too - not just pocket money for the sake of it!Maybe your children could earn pocket moneyby washing the car, fence painting or weeding .So the ‘olden days’ sound like they had a lot to offer, they’ve also got your history too, why not investigate and create a family tree or look up what used to be in your area - what did it look like a  years ago, what did schools and homes look like and transport too, what did people do for fun, apart from the above of course.In doing and enjoying all these ‘olden day’ activities maybe you’ll inspire your child with a love of history, a love of finding out, a love of baking, cooking, gardening and maybe, most importantly of all, a love of being in a family where people talk and play and enjoying being together.P.S. in the olden days many people would have just put baby in a pram in the garden - don’t do this.And young toddlers and young children were cared for and played with by older children and teenagers - do do this and have some peace!Have a safe and healthy week everyone x. googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

In addition to Colum Cille’s own foundations at Derry and Durrow, these monasteries all looked to Iona as their leader.They adhered to the traditions of the Irish church.These Columban monasteries played a leading role in the expansion of Christianity they converted the Picts and restored Christianity to Anglo-Saxon Northumbria in the th century.In the second half of the th century Iona was at the height of its prestige – the laws of Colum Cille held sway in Ireland, with the abbots of Iona making frequent trips there.This period of Columban expansion resulted in the appearance of two art forms to Irish monasteries namely, high crosses and illuminated manuscripts.The fusion of Irish techniques of timber construction and Northumbrian skills in stone carving resulted in the appearance of highly decorated standing crosses in Irish monasteries from the second half of the th century.These elaborate high crosses with the wheel head design, in which a circle surrounded the point of intersection, developed from the earlier simple pillar stones of the th century on which crosses were incised.In the monastery at Derry there would now have appeared intricate high crosses on which scenes from the Bible were sculptured.The purpose of the crosses ied. Some marked burials, others signied a boundary of some sort, while others acted as focuses of prayer.Distinctive manuscripts on parchment were now being produced in Columban monasteries.Sometime between  and  the Book of Kells, a brilliantly illuminated copy of the four gospels with Latin text, known as “the Great Gospel of Columkille”, was written.Its precise origin is unknown not every monastery could produce such highly decorated and, at the same time, legible and correct copies of gospels written in Latin.Undoubtedly it was written in a Columban monastery, as they were famed for their teaching of Latin and the classics and for the skills of their craftsmen and artists.It was unlikely to have been written in Derry, as the team of scribes and artists required to produce such a masterpiece probably only existed at the monastic centre of the Columban confederation, which was Iona to  and subsequently Kells in central Ireland.The contents of the th century library and scriptorium at Derry have not survived.Colum Cille, according to the Annals of Clonmacnoise, wrote  books, all copies of the New Testaments. Copies were left with each of his churches, which, of course, included Derry.The earliest surviving decorated Irish manuscript is the Cathach or Battle Book, a copy of the psalms, which according to tradition was written by Colum Cille towards the end of the th century.It was handed down in the family of Conall Gulban, i.e. Colum Cille’s kin, and it was always carried three times round the army to ensure victory before they went into battle.Illumination in this manuscript was confined to the fine large capital letters at the beginning of each psalm.With the Book of Durrow, a copy of the four gospels written in the mid-th century, an Irish style had emerged in which at the beginning of each gospel there was on the left a full ornamented page, brilliantly coloured, with intricate designs of spirals and interlocking animals and plants while on the right there was an introductory page beginning with a large, beautully proportioned, capital letter. In addition, portraits or symbols were used to depict each of the four evangelists.The Book of Kells marked the pinnacle of Irish achievement in manuscript production, with its profusion of illustration, colour and ornamentation, and its repeated use of the same symbols for the four evangelists a man for Matthew, a lion for Mark, a calf for Luke and an eagle for John.By the end of the th century the monastic settlement at Derry would have changed little.The monastic complex would still have been made of timber.The only new physical feature would have been the erection of a few high stone crosses.The scriptorium may have begun to produce some basic illuminated manuscripts, similar to the Cathach. It would, of course, have continued to make straight copies of the psalms and gospels.In  a fleet of ships, the like of which had never been seen before, sailed up Lough Foyle.These ships, built of oak, some over  feet long and  feet wide, and steered by a rudder paddle, were powered by both oar and sail.From  feet pine masts fluttered square sails of double-thickness strips of red and white woven cloth, and, from behind rows of shields slung over the side, men, up to  on each boat, pulled on narrow-bladed spruce oars and manoeuvred the boats into the sheltered waters of the River Foyle.They beached their boats, which drew only three feet of water, on the shore beneath the monastery.From the boats men rushed up the hill, the leaders wearing protective coats of mail and helmets with a nose piece which projected down over the face the rest, following close behind, in thick woollen coats which reached half way down their thighs.They all carried a round wooden shield, many of which were painted either yellow or black.The long, broad, two-edged iron sword and the long-handled, broad-edged battle axe were the principal weapons they carried.Some were armed with spears, others with bow and arrows. Most had an iron kne, with a wood or bone handle, tucked in their belts.The Vikings had located the monastic settlement at Derry, and, as where in Ireland and Britain, they met no organised resistance.They burnt the abbey and massacred her clergy and students.Not only was the monastery an easy target to attack because of its secluded, yet very accessible, location, it was also a very rewarding one.Derry was a centre of wealth, rich in lands and livestock.The Vikings were interested in food provisions, to sustain further voyages, as well as in the precious metal ornaments associated with a monastery.They were also interested in taking prisoners, especially girls, as they had been trading in human slaves to central Europe for centuries.The Vikings never attempted to settle in Derry.In  they again attacked, but this time they were driven back, with great losses, by Niall Caille, King of Ireland and Murchadh, Prince of Aileach.Derry continued to be attractive to Viking invaders throughout the th century.In  the shrine of Colum Cille was carried away by the Vikings. In  and  she was again plundered.Derry’s long-term growth did not suffer because of the Viking raids,anything it increased.With the Viking raids on Iona in ,  and , the monks acquired a site at Kells in central Ireland, and, bearing the relics of Colum Cille, moved there to found a new monastery.There was a steady rise in the status and importance of Derry from , as she succeeded Iona and then Kells as the centre of all Columban foundations in Ireland and Scotland.By the end of the th century Derry was known as Doire Columcille, as opposed to Doire Calgach.This Viking period resulted in two new additions to the monastery at Derry: her first stone church and a round tower.Sometime after the first raid in , the wooden church, which the Vikings burnt, was replaced with a stone one.It would have been a simple building, similar in shape to its wooden predecessors.This stone single-chamber church, later known as Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church, was perhaps no longer than  feet.It probably had one narrow slit for a window, and was roofed with stone to simulate overlapping tiles. Housing for the monks and their tenant farmers was still made of the traditional wood and wattle combination.Sometime between the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century, a round tower of stone was built next to the Black Abbey church to serve a iety of purposes, such as a belfry, a watch tower and a place of refuge.Perhaps  feet high and  feet in diameter, with five floors, each lit by one window except the top which had four, entrance was gained,  feet above ground level, by a movable ladder.Inside, each wooden floor was linked by a wooden staircase. If set on fire this tower would have been a death trap, as the up-draught working on ignited wooden floors would have created an inferno.By the turn of the th century Derry was beginning to see a revival in its fortunes as an important monastic town.Apart from the additions of elaborate stone crosses, a small dry-stone church and a round tower, Derry was still very similar to the settlement founded in . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John Wade works in St Jerome Bilingual School in Harrow, London and has put together learning packs for all year groups, from Primary  to Primary . “I started offering free resources to try and help parents out,” he told Derry Now. “I’m teaching in a school, but I also do some tutoring online and on a one-to-one basis as well. “Everyone was really worried about their children not being able to go to school and even when the schools were still open, they were pulling them out. googletag.cmd.push “There is only so much the schools can do, so I’ve put these packs together from Primary  right through to Primary . It’s just a way of trying to help people out. “ The rapidly moving situation has caused confusion in all schools across the UK but John says the school have been supportive, especially with him being away from home. “I was worried about trying to get home at Easter to see family but the school I’m in have been brilliant, they’ve advised us as much as we can. “No one really knew what was going on. It’s been hectic because you’re trying to get things ready for the children in school as well and then you didn’t knowit was closing or not. googletag.cmd.push “It’s really dficult because even the headteachers don’t know what’s going on. It’s important that parents understand that schools are doing their best to react too.” Any parents interested in John’s resources can get in touch through his Facebook page John Wade Primary Tutoring.

Vincent Rainey, from Dunloy, Co Antrim, began hosting the quizzes from his Facebook page last week, with much of the country already in self-imposed lockdown. The mortgage advisor says the idea stemmed from a throwaway comment while enjoying a glass of wine with his family to relieve the boredom of lockdown. He said: “Catherine, Lauren and I were having a chat over a glass of wine. “Quizzes are my hobby and I just had this random notion about doing a live broadcast, which I’d never done before.” googletag.cmd.push Engagement was central in Vincent’s thinking when building the idea. He wanted to ensure that those living in isolation, particularly those living alone, had access to some interaction. He said: “A lot of people are on their own and I want to try and make sure that they are socially involved, particularly those people who are really on their own. “It’s about figuring out ways for people to communicate with their friends and family, so they are not isolated.” The quiz was launched on Saturday, March  and over  people tuned into the online broadcast, but Vincent says he had a bit of homework to do before he got going. googletag.cmd.push “I YouTubed it,” he admits. “I have loads of content, having done this for a number of years, but I’d never done a live feed, so I had to figure out even how to do that!” The Dunloy man says the experience of hosting an online quiz is a dferent experience for someone used to the more social environment of a pub or hall. “I was quite apprehensive doing it online for the first time,” he said. “In a pub, or on a stage, you can gauge your audience, so you knowthey’re engaged. You can tell by body language their level of interest. “The only way you can check online is through comments and reactions, but that’s good because you want to know you’re not making a complete ass of yourself!” Watching along in another room in the house is Vincent’s we Catherine and daughter Lauren, and with the help of technology, son Josh joins them from Canada. “We just go into a dferent room and it all works well,” said Catherine. “Our son lives in Winnipeg, Canada and got in touch through Facebook Messenger. On one phone we had the quiz coming up and on the other we had a live chat open with Josh. “That conversation makes things much easier and much more satisfying. You can see the other person’s face and engage. The quiz’s reach is growing steadily, with Saturday night engaging over  eager participants, and Vincent is beginning to reach a global audience from his kitchen. He said: “I saw messages from New York, Houston in Texas and there was someone  joining in from Chicago, so there is beginning to be an international feel.” You can increase the Derry contingent by getting involved. See details of the next online quiz by visiting Vincent’s Facebook page.

Caitriacuteona Lagan, from Castledawson, won the U All-Ireland mandolin title at the  Fleadh in Drogheda and is usually found playing at a session every weekend. Due to the measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus, however, she has ploughed her efforts into performing online and sharing much-needed positivity. Caitriacuteona told the County Derry Post that it was vital to keep people’s spirits up at this time. She said: “I think it’s very important to keep playing because it can cheer people up and help them to take their minds off things. It makes them feel better. googletag.cmd.push “It’s nice to keep children happy and, instead of all the technology, give them something  to do as well.” The -year-old recently posted a video of her playing a few tunes for the children of Kilronan Special School in Magherafelt. Her mother, Roisiacuten, said Caitriacuteona had a great fondness for the children at Kilronan, having held charity events and performed there before. She said: “After she won the All-Ireland, we didn’t really get a chance to play any events, so for her th birthday she wanted to have a big session. “We don’t have any connections with Kilronan or anything, but she had met a few children at sessions who went to it. googletag.cmd.push “She did a charity night and then was invited up to the school and the summer scheme, so she’s been up and they know her. “She decided, in order to keep her practice up, she would share some videos online. It’s a good way for her to practise and it’s good for her confidence too. One thing that Caitriacuteona will miss out on this year is the annual series of Fleadhanna – county, provincial and All-Ireland – which have had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. She said: “I’m a wee bit disappointed because I love going to the festivals because the atmosphere is so good at them. “I’m using the time to catch up with my schoolwork, take my dogs for a walkI can, do a wee bit of painting, bake at some point, practise my music. “I play a few dferent instruments – banjo, mandolin, fiddle, guitar and piano.” Caitriacuteona’s mum Roisiacuten said that social media has been a godsend for the music community during this time. “At the minute it’s the only way people are able to connect. A lot of Caitriacuteona’s friends would be in the music scene, and she would be at sessions every week, so she’s missing that. “With the Fleadh not being on this year, there’s going to be a massive gap. We normally plan our whole year around the fleadh, so the music is great for everyone to keep spirits up.” Caitriacuteona is certainly helping to keep spirits up, and Roisiacuten said a few children had already been in touch via social media. “A wee boy this morning sent her a rainbow, so hopefully they keep coming and keep children and adults occupied.” You can keep up to date with Caitriacuteona’s videos via her Twitter and Facebook accounts.

In recent days, the debate around essential services has been widely raised with no further clarity emerging for businesses and employees. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The situation is getting more confusing by the day. We have had many businesses in the North West impacted because of this confusion. The supply chain to all essential services is broad and it incorporates a vast number of companies in many sectors. “Take for example the food supply chain. That does not just consist of places that produce foodstuffs, but there is also a huge supply chain supporting it from those that produce agricultural products, oil companies for heating and keeping lorries on roads, food labelling and packaging, to distribution. If one of these links is broken, it will have an impact on the end product we have on our supermarket shelves. googletag.cmd.push “We must stop demonising businesses for trying to keep essential work going during this crisis and instead work with them to ensure they can keep the business going, whilst also ensuring the safety of employees. “Maintaining essential supplies will protect public confidence that we can feed the nation whilst everyone  is told to stay at home and fight this virus. “We urge the Executive to show leadership and work effectively with businesses and workers to outline what are essential businesses. The establishment of a forum on workplace safety is welcome but we need to see decisions and guidance. With every day that passes, more essential businesses are forced to close.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In recent days, the debate around essential services has been widely raised with no further clarity emerging for businesses and employees. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The situation is getting more confusing by the day. We have had many businesses in the North West impacted because of this confusion. The supply chain to all essential services is broad and it incorporates a vast number of companies in many sectors. “Take for example the food supply chain. That does not just consist of places that produce foodstuffs, but there is also a huge supply chain supporting it from those that produce agricultural products, oil companies for heating and keeping lorries on roads, food labelling and packaging, to distribution. If one of these links is broken, it will have an impact on the end product we have on our supermarket shelves. googletag.cmd.push “We must stop demonising businesses for trying to keep essential work going during this crisis and instead work with them to ensure they can keep the business going, whilst also ensuring the safety of employees. “Maintaining essential supplies will protect public confidence that we can feed the nation whilst everyone  is told to stay at home and fight this virus. “We urge the Executive to show leadership and work effectively with businesses and workers to outline what are essential businesses. The establishment of a forum on workplace safety is welcome but we need to see decisions and guidance. With every day that passes, more essential businesses are forced to close.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities.

It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Lurgan man Geoff Gates, who has created the Limitless weight loss programme, believes people shouldn’t use lockdown as an excuse to adopt a poor diet and exercise routine.He said: “The Limitless philosophy has always been that the only reason people get stuck in a rut is because of their limiting beliefs. If you feel good through proper nutrition and smart exercise, you will naturally be drawn towards better lestyle choices.”At times of great stress, for many diet often goes out the window. Geoff shared his advice on how to eat well during a crisis: “The issue here is we need to be not using food to combat stress but instead, tackle the stress head-on, that’s the first step. “I get all my clients to start practising meditation immediately. When I first suggest meditation to someone, they often wonderI’m joking or being serious. It’s not some hippy-dippy woo-woo thing, this is a proper prescription. They often report profound changes almost immediately.”Geoff said that having been overweight and depressed himself helped him to create Limitless: “There is gold in the depths of despair, and I count my experience as a blessing now. Without my personal struggle, I could never have developed the techniques to create the best weight loss programme in the world.”He said in terms of nutrition it was important to focus on quality food: “Broccoli is especially good for the lungs and its funny that it looks like a lung, just like walnuts a great for brain health they look like a little brain. As bizarre as this may sound, I believe our creator has provided us with clues.”Geoff said the current situation makes it even more important to make shopping lists, especially now that visits to the shops are meant to be limited. He commented: “There are always ways to make healthy food convenient food. We all own a freezer, so it’s just a matter of being a little bit smart and preparing ahead. “I advise my coaching clients to buy freezer bags then put all the ingredients together in the bag and use as and when they need them.”In terms of exercise he said: “I don’t think it’s been more relevant to use our time to focus on our health and fitness. The most used excuse I have heard continuously through my  years in the fitness industry was that people didn’t have time. Now we have an abundance of it. “So now you have plenty of time the next excuse will be that you don’t have the equipment. I refuse to hear it. “The simple truth is we don’t need gyms and never have needed them. The way I see it is the gyms have been a luxury, not a necessity. “The misconception is that you cannot get strong, fit and healthy without one – the truth being you can get the same results with just your good self, become your own gym.”He added: “If I was going to advise on one piece of home equipment it would be an adjustable set of dumbbells. He suggested a quickfire lockdown workout could include  bodyweight squats,  star jumps,  straight punches,  upper cuts,  push ups and  mountain climbers.He said those conscious of social distancing could exercise earlier to avoid encountering other people: “I have always got up at am to train so when I am out running in the morning, there is no one about. For me, being outside when no one is around is perfectly acceptable. We need fresh air.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It needs to be stressed that the vast majority of people are doing the right thing. I want to thank them publicly and to acknowledge how tough it is to stay at home and keep your distance from others. However there has been a lot of attention on the small minority who have not followed the public health advice. It is essential that these tight restrictions are rigorously maintained in the weeks ahead. Quite simply, lives depend on it. So, let me appeal to everyone not to slip back into old habits. Any signs of complacency and impatience must be strongly resisted. Our actions now will impact on the spread of coronavirus in future weeks. Don’t lose heart or think the measures aren’t working just because of the current numbers and trends. What we are doing now is aimed at future weeks – slowing the spread of the virus and flattening its peak by drastically reducing human contact. That’s how we protect each other and protect our health service. We all have to stick with it, to get through this together. I make no apology for re-stating the vital advice once again. Stay at home. Please. Only go outit’s absolutely necessary and,you do, make sure you keep your distance from others. Wash your hands, thoroughly. When you sneeze or cough, use a tissue and then dispose of it – catch it, bin it, kill it. As a prominent doctor said in recent days, we can all be heroes. When we get through this as a society – which we will – you will want to look back and say you played your full part in fighting back against COVID-. I know very well the anxiety being felt across the community. I’m feeling exactly the same way - as a husband, a father and a son. But we have grounds for hope and positivity, alongside the deep apprehension. Social distancing will make a major dference –we keep doing it right and doing it together. Let’s take heart from the way people from all walks of le are coming forward to provide essential help. Our HSC workforce appeal is seeking new recruits to our health and social care workforce during the pandemic. Within a few short days of the appeal going live online, more than , people had signed up to register their interest in taking on roles. And there is large scale community-level volunteering going on, helping older and other vulnerable people cope during these dficult times. The Department for Communities is playing a key role in this area. When we look back, I hope we will remember how this crisis brought out the best in us how neighbours and strangers alike stepped up to help their fellow citizens in a time of grave need. When this is over, we will have a lot of rebuilding to do. Grief-stricken families, shattered lives, the economic and social fabric of society permanently altered. The collective spirit being forged right now will stand us in good stead.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_ffbfabcacebfeccd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aeffbfdacbcdfbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1585734877583.jpg--minister_highlights_key_findings_of_ni_covid_19_modelling.jpg?158573487700","title":"minister highlights key findings of ni covid  modelling ","story":",\"image\":,\"description\":\"THE crucial importance of social distancing in NI has been graphically brought home by local modelling data on COVID-.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Health Minister Robin Swann has set out key findings of an expert NI modelling study, which will inform intensive hospital planning for the forthcoming surge in COVID- cases. “In summary, the research indicates that our health service would have a realistic prospect of coping in this initial perioda sufficient proportion of the population adhere to the social distancing and self-isolation measures,” Mr Swann said. “However, it is important that this is considered in context, and I would emphasise that it provides no grounds whatsoever for dropping our guard. On the contrary, the projections underline that the continuation of rigorous social distancing will save many lives and protect our health service from collapse. “Even then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le In Northern Ireland. “In addition, the absence of a vaccine means we will have to plan for a potential second wave of COVID- cases later in the year.” The modelling outcome sets out a reasonable worst case scenario, based on a number of assumptions including social distancing measures producing a % reduction in contacts outside the home and workplace. In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation. The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  COVID- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic. The peak number of COVID- hospital admissions would be  per week. Under this reasonable worst case scenario, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The modelling indicates that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic is expected between - April . The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced. This will remain the case until there is substantial population immunity either as a result of recovery from infection or successful vaccination.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_ffbfabcacebfeccd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aeffbfdacbcdfbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
