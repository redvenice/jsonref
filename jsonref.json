Right - there you go. It\u0027s a word, referring to a toy - a toy.\u0027Ms Widdecombe claims she used the derogatory slur in reference to a number of toys she metaphorically threw \u0027out of the pram\u0027 amid rumours campaign funding was being erted away from Plymouth ahead of the General Election tomorrow.   When asked if she would apologise for using what is now considered offensive language, the outspoken politician said: \u0027No, I am not apologising. I am not apologising, seriously.\u0027In response to whether it was a reflection of wider racism in the Brexit Party, she said: \u0027I fundamentally think that\u0027s a very stupid question to ask. \u0027It\u0027s just a game that people play - a stupid, cynical game, that I am no part of at all.\u0027         The 72-year-old is standing for the Brexit Party in the Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport constituencyQuizzed on whether ethnic minority groups would be offended by her words, Ms Widdecombe said: \u0027I would say, they should not be offended by it. It\u0027s in reference to a toy. It\u0027s not something to be offended by.\u0027If I were to say good morning, everyone would be offended. If it wasn\u0027t a good morning, someone would be offended by me saying it.\u0027But one party insider has blasted the use of the term as \u0027racist\u0027.They said: \u0027I understand a lot of Ann\u0027s comments previously were based on her religious beliefs.\u0027But racism is racism. The Brexit Party is no longer a broad church, it\u0027s become a vehicle for the far right.\u0027 Ms Widdecombe is no stranger to controversy. In June she appeared on TV to support her views there is a \u0027cure\u0027 to being gay.    She told Sky News viewers during the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that science may yet \u0027provide an answer\u0027 to the question of whether people can \u0027switch sexuality\u0027.She has also been expressed strong anti-abortion views and opposed same sex marriages.

In February he said: \u0027We could make sure that 0.7 per cent is spent more in line with Britain\u0027s political commercial and diplomatic interests.\u0027         Britain\u0027s foreign aid department could be axed if Boris Johnson wins the general election. Pictured: Mr Johnson in Manchester yesterdayTory sources yesterday suggested that the idea of folding into the foreign office into the Foreign Office was \u0027speculation\u0027.But a Government official told the Financial Times: \u0027There is thinking going on about it. We want things to work better overseas. This shake-up could be positive.\u0027Some Dfid officials believe the move could be a pretext for cutting the aid budget. The Tories have previously suggested expanding the definition of aid to include spending on diplomatic and military missionsOne Dfid source said staff would resign if there was any attempt to scrap the department or change its priorities. The move would also require a change in the law, which requires the government to adhere to aid rules set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Officials point out that the Foreign Office already spends some aid cash and has faced fierce criticism over projects such as grants to the Chinese film industry.One Dfid source said: \u0027The Foreign Office spends 10 per cent of the money and causes 90 per cent of the controversy.\u0027Mr Johnson is expected to conduct only a minor reshuffle if he wins this week.

In Spanish.And this same honourable man, we are repeatedly told, has fought racism all his life and has himself said that anti-Semitism is ‘vile’ — even though he has allowed it to flourish among his party’s members and representatives.He has also denounced Israel an ‘apartheid occupier’, in spite of the fact Israel has been defending its borders for seven decades.(Indeed, it’s a classic move in the Corbyn playbook. Israelis are always portrayed as the aggressors, while terrorist organisations such as Hamas and Hezbollah, whose unwritten constitution states that the Jews should be destroyed and driven into the sea, are simply ‘friends’.)And yet, somehow, despite all of this, Britain’s Jews have refused to become victims.         Corbyn, John McDonnell and their senior adviser, Seumas Milne — all privately educated — now control the largest political party in Western EuropeOver the centuries, Jews from across the world have sought refuge in Britain. Rather than make a fuss, they put their heads down and their market stalls up. They saved and scrimped to buy schoolbooks so that their children could study, graduate and give back to the country that had given them shelter from their would-be murderers.And they certainly did give back, by adopting the culture of this country and supporting the arts, participating in local politics, contributing their intelligence, time and creativity.Except they did all this only to find themselves back in the position of scapegoat, wrongly blamed by the hard-Left for ten years of economic austerity brought on by a banking crisis and a technological revolution.Jews, of course, aren’t the only group who have been ignored by Corbyn’s porous anti-racist biography.Indeed, this honourable man, an anti-racist hero, no less, has shown negligible concern towards the plight of the Christian Yazidis fleeing Isis. Nor does he seem bothered by the murder of the Muslim Rohingyas in Burma, or the brainwashing of the Uighurs in China. They don’t get his goat — or his scapegoat — in the same way.         Jews, of course, aren’t the only group who have been ignored by Corbyn’s porous anti-racist biography, writes Maureen LipmanInstead, Corbyn hones in only on Palestine, boasting that he plans to become the first British prime minister to formally recognise it as a state.And so his supporters trundle on, regurgitating sinister conspiracy theories about the Jews being rich, power-hungry capitalists.I don’t know about my fellow Jews, but I find it so tiring running the banks, the media, the state and the entertainment industry all at once.It’s a miracle I still have time to do my shift in the corner shop on Coronation Street.But, hang on. Has there ever actually been a prominent Jewish world leader, save in Israel and not counting the convert Disraeli?How come we are so powerful, sly and clever that we do so badly at winning leadership?Surely, Mr Corbyn and his cabal’s success is proof they are more powerful than us.After all, Corbyn, John McDonnell and their senior adviser, Seumas Milne — all privately educated — now control the largest political party in Western Europe.So, what is it that makes you fear us? It is fear, after all. Because prejudice always has fear at its root.On the whole, we don’t stab innocent civilians. We don’t stone LGBT people, or bring down planes, or poison doorknobs, or groom poor white girls.Can you imagine the recriminations if we did just one such act? There wouldn’t be a shop front left in Golders Green or an undesecrated cemetery in south Manchester.We’re not all perfect, of course. We’re not a homogenised species — though, in relation to our size, we have the lowest crime rate of any faith.Our philosophers are greater than our philanderers, and our philanthropy is greater than both.I won’t quote our disproportionate number of Nobel Prize winners, because we know it and mumble it with quiet pride. We punch so hard above our weight we could flatten Anthony Joshua with a dreidel.We’ve been here for 4,000 years and survived pogroms and genocides. If history shows us anything, it’s that we’ll survive this upstart Islington wuss.But if we are to do so, today is the time for everyone — Jewish or not — to stand up.Five years of a Corbyn government — whether it starts tomorrow or after five interminable years of a hung Parliament — would be a stain on all of us.Britain would be thrown so far to the Left that it goes all the way round and ends up holding hands with Tommy Robinson’s boys.

But naturally all anyone can talk about is the guy who taped a $120,000 banana to the wall and the other guy who ate it.The initial piece, Comedian by the Italian-born artist Maurizio Cattelan, and the subsequent performanceaction, Hungry Artist by Georgian-born David Datuna, may seem too ludicrous to even parody, but all parties are making a good show of taking the matter seriously. In its pre-masticated form, Cattelan claimed that he worked on Comedian for a year, before deciding on exactly how to let the banana manifest itself. (In earlier conceptions, it was made of resin, before the sculptor realized “the banana is supposed to be a banana”.) Gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin explained that the angle of the tape and shape of the fruit were “carefully considered”.While Cattelan certainly has an impish sense of humor, he isn’t someone who barged on to the scene with a bag of groceries. He has had a long career pushing boundaries that include golden toilets (yes, the one recently stolen from Blenheim Palace was his), taxidermy, waxworks of John F Kennedy, the pope and Hitler, and large sculptures of extended middle fingers. When the banana was taped to the wall, it quickly sold for $120,000, followed by another. A third was up for bid to a museum at $150,000 before David Datuna hit the Miami Beach convention center.Datuna is not just another prankster looking for a potassium fix. He proudly tells me via telephone that he is one of only two artists to have had shows at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery while still alive. His mixed-media sculptures often include eyeglasses as a motif, and in recent years he has done site-specific political work, such as laying out blocks of ice to spell Trump in New York’s Union Square, which would later melt. (This action was inspired by the withdrawal from the Paris agreement.) In 2022 in Qatar, timed for the World Cup, he is planning, as he calls it, the largest art installation incorporating artificial intelligence that has ever happened.There was near pandemonium from selfie-takers around Comedian in Miami, and when Datuna saw it (and saw it was from Cattelan) he thought it was great. But when he Googled it and saw the asking price it took “about 15 or 20 minutes” to conceive of “the answer I must give to him and to the art world”.“Warhol put banana on a canvas,” Datuna says with his Georgian accent. “Cattelan takes a real banana and puts it on the wall. David took banana from the wall and ate it!”Datuna called his performance piece Hungry Artist and it quickly went viral. He did not have permission from Cattelan or the Perrotin Gallery.Below is a further transcript of our phone conversation, edited for clarity.Have you met Maurizio Cattelan?No, but I follow him, he is a great artist.Has he reached out to you since this past weekend?It’s plausible you will meet him some day on the contemporary art circuit, though. Would it be a warm meeting?I would love to meet him. I think he is a genius. Art is about comedy, about fun, about tragedy, about emotions. He played this very well. I love the banana of Andy Warhol, but I think Cattelan has put the banana on a different level.What I don’t like, however, is that a banana costs 20 cents. I think it is a good idea to put it in a museum if it is free to watch. But when you sell it for $120,000? Then decide to make a second and third edition, and that third edition is $150,000? It is silly, and not good for our contemporary life.I have travelled in 67 countries around the world in the last three years, and I see how people live. Millions are dying without food. Then he puts three bananas on the wall for half a million dollars?So you felt compelled to do something?Cattelan beat Andy Warhol. Maybe I shouldn’t say beat, but brought it to another level. I began to think: “What can I do with this banana? How can I bring it to yet another level?” And how to do it also with comedy? So I ate the banana. It is something deeper.It’s like the story of Picasso and Modigliani, when they were having problems. Modigliani’s girlfriend gave Picasso some pieces and in the next week or two they had a group exhibition and what happened was Picasso painted his art on top of Modigliani’s art. He just left small pieces that you could recognize as Modigliani but it was Picasso. This is the same thing what happens now, but in a concept. Concept gets another concept.Do you eat a lot of bananas?About once a year. I do not really like them.If you could tell Maurizio “next time, put this kind of fruit on the wall” what would you choose?Next time Maurizio won’t put any fruit on a wall. Go on the internet now and you see everyone is doing this now. But I am no banana eater.The gallery owner stressed that without an artist’s certificate, the banana just reverts to being a regular banana. Do you subscribe to this theory of artistic transubstantiation?This has happened before, with Damien Hirst’s sharks that needed to be replaced. It is the idea that is important.I hate to be vulgar, but it is a part of life: everything one eats eventually leaves the body. Did you feel a sense of artistic fulfillment when the banana left your body?I felt, in my body, not part of the banana, but part of Maurizio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6784ef25156c860ae683748eb2a8c3ae5ae642eb/0_626_4596_2758/master/4596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4214d03025c33987d69759e88414cf0b","title":"dougie wallaces east end in pictures","story":"For his latest book, East Ended, Dougie Wallace focuses on the characters and street art of heavily graffitied Brick Lane, Redchurch Street and Sclater Street in Shoreditch, an area of east London that has rapidly gentrified in recent years but still has a subversive identity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e48b228eafee036510e2cb549467e076b6e426/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6b96e29ed359e35a60e3333a02944de","title":"matisse and picasso the art worlds greatest rivalry in pictures","story":"In the nation’s first dual exhibition of Matisse and Picasso, more than 200 works – from paintings and sculptures to drawings and costumes – have arrived at the National Gallery of Australia to tell the story of the competitive friendship of the modern European masters.

As in, stop giving a fuck, calm the fuck down, say “fuck, no”: all sentiments at the heart of every self-help book published since the genre exploded. But where these books were once determinedly optimistic and outwardly focused on goals such as making money and influencing people, they now assume the voice of your bluntest friend, one who is not afraid to curse while telling you how it is.Self-help has turned sweary, and no one has made being blue a bigger part of their brand than Sarah Knight, author of the five “No Fucks Given Guides”, most recently Fuck No!. The series, which started with the 2015 bestseller The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fuck, has sold more than 2m copies worldwide and ushered in a new wave of tough-love tomes, such as The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson and Gary John Bishop’s Unfuck Yourself – each bestsellers themselves.Pragmatic, profane, irreverent, it is self-help for people who don’t like self-help, says Knight, 41, a former book editor who credits Jen Sincero with starting the trend with You Are a Badass back in 2013. The appeal, Knight suggests, is “because readers have these pent-up feelings that they felt they couldn’t express, and we are helping them channel them”.Knight’s debut was intended as an affectionate parody of Marie Kondo’s 2011 tidying bible, persuasively subtitled, “How to stop spending time you don’t have with people you don’t like doing things you don’t want to do”. (Baby showers, for Knight, are a particular sticking point.)The desire to say no – to care less – is already there, says Knight her books just give readers permission to act on it, like throwing a lit match on gasoline. “That’s been the catalyst for them to go forth and feel liberated, and live lives that they want to live … I’m really preaching what I consider to be common sense, as someone who has done it – and I’m here to tell them that it works.”In 2009, Knight was a senior editor at Random House in New York and had just signed Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl when she suffered her first panic attack, passing out in front of her coworkers. It spurred what she remembers now as “a watershed time” of re-evaluation and reckoning, and a clinical diagnosis of anxiety, which eventually led to her giving up her 15-year career in publishing and relocating with her husband to the Caribbean.The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fuck, bringing together the lessons of what Knight terms her “great personal and professional meltdown”, was published just six months after Knight finally quit her job. The book has since sold more than half a million copies, with Knight’s own trade of the rat race for a tropical island a big selling point. Such literal escape may not be possible for everyone – both Knight and her husband Judd can work remotely, and they are happily child-free – but the spirit of “no fucks given” behind it is, she says.“I’m getting messages daily from people as young as 14, 15 years old, saying ‘I loved your book, it’s making me think about what I want to do with my life’, and from people in their 60s and 70s saying ‘I wish I’d adopted this life philosophy sooner’,” she says.She summarises her philosophy, explored over five books, as “take care of yourself first”: granting yourself permission to say no, free from anxiety or guilt. Her method works to reduce mental clutter in the same way that Kondo’s removed it from the home, creating space for joy. Policing one’s personal boundaries gets easier with practice, she says. “I do not agree that selfish is a four-letter word, even though it gets treated like that in our society – and I know quite a bit about four-letter words.”Some people do need to be told to prioritise their health and happiness as much as they do their career or, in the case of caregivers, other people’s, says Knight. “And for an older generation, they just didn’t ever know it was allowed – they weren’t raised in a culture that promoted personal wellbeing.”Today we have arguably over-corrected, with the modern preoccupation with “wellness” – which Knight agrees her work taps into – reflecting widespread unease with the impact of technology, work-life imbalance and unstable employment on our health. But she suggests that anxiety and burnout may not be more prevalent today than in the past – we might just understand them better. “At the very least, we’re talking about them more, so it may make them feel more present.”Knight is upfront that she is not a doctor or therapist, but even a strategy as simple as what she terms the “no-and-switch” (politely declining, with a preferred alternative) might still help some. “Having the opportunity to read a $20 book and get some really good suggestions, if you can’t afford $2,000 in therapy, can only help.” She readily admits that many of the techniques in her books are “just cognitive behavioural therapy, dressed up in sweary language – but I also take medication, and I’m not ashamed of that.” But Knight’s advice, while sensible at the inidual level, sits uneasily against a global backdrop of inequality and climate change that can only be tackled collectively. Are more people thinking only of themselves really what the world needs?“I’m not trying to raise a generation of sociopaths, or say that all you should do is look out for number one, because you won’t have a good life that way either,” she says. It is possible to prioritise one’s own needs without hurting others, “or at least without it hurting someone else more than it helps you”.Say you refuse an invitation to a dinner party: “Yes, you are disappointing your friend. However, if you have terrible social anxiety or a really demanding job, and you simply cannot be out until 10 at night, guzzling white wine on a Wednesday – it would hurt you more to say yes, than it hurts them for you to say no,” Knight says. She calls it being “self-ish”: a kind of risk-benefit analysis that takes others’ needs into account – to an extent. “On the flipside, I think that other people have to be a little bit less sensitive about me not coming to their dinner party.”She puts down the failures of political leaders in the US and the UK to greed. “To me, that’s not what being selfish is … that’s the root of all evil.” Knight is unequivocal in her disgust at the egocentrism on display among politicians in Fuck No!, she writes that her aim is to “destigmatise the act of saying nyet … as in, ‘No, I won’t accept foreign interference in this election.’”There is also a “mini-chapter” in Fuck No! on sexual consent, empowering women to say no for any reason they like. It took Knight 30 years to learn this lesson herself, in which time she had sex with “awful” people, wasted time and compromised her inidual ethics with “regrettable yeses”.Noes beget noes, with more positive consequences than negative. “You have to be able to communicate your boundaries. Otherwise, you are not going to be happy. It’s not just ‘no, I don’t want to come to your open mic night’, it’s no to your parents, your siblings, your lover, your children,” Knight says. “We all have to be able to do it a little bit better. There’s no point in walking around feeling resentful, obligated and guilty while doing things we don’t want to do.”It is a reminder that the personal is political. Though Knight’s philosophy may seem obvious, women – still socialised to put others first – are more likely to benefit from it. She agrees that her books have “a feminist bent”, but says that her imagined reader is her younger self.“Don’t wait as long as I did. I just wish I had known all this stuff 20 years ago … I’m constantly reminding myself of my own advice,” says Knight. Does she swear at herself, too? “I do.”• Fuck No! by Sarah Knight is published by Quercus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2303181eac744bdcd19df4c1bf4a494a6fd2abc5/0_164_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bea84831412fb678952598f1a96ffc80","title":"lloyds of london issues trans and non binary inclusion guide","story":"Guide is part of cultural change at insurance market after sexual harassment scandalLloyd’s of London has issued a guide to the inclusion of trans and non-binary people as part of a cultural overhaul at the insurance market after a damaging sexual harassment scandal.The 29-page document, published on the Lloyd’s website, offers advice and resources to people working in insurance about how to foster a “stable emotional work environment” for trans and non-binary colleagues.In a foreword to the guide, the group’s head of ersity and inclusion, Marc McKenna-Coles, acknowledged the 333-year-old market was “commonly conceived as being traditional in outlook”.This perception was not helped by the emergence earlier this year of testimony from hundreds of staff about routine sexual harassment, described by the chief executive, John Neal, as “truly terrible”.Staff have since been sent emailed warnings, coupled with a poster campaign in City of London bars, urging them to behave themselves during Christmas party season.Lloyd’s launched the inclusion guide in tandem with Global Butterflies, which helps businesses improve their understanding of issues relating to trans and non-binary people.The guide includes advice on issues such as language, including how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer to use to describe themselves.Managers are advised to help make colleagues feel welcome by including their own pronouns in email signatures.The guide, which includes case studies from trans and non-binary people working across the industry, also offers thoughts on how to be an effective ally to trans and non-binary people, including by speaking out against transphobic behaviour.Explanatory tools include a “genderbread person” graphic that explores the interplay between gender identity, sexuality, gender expression and biological sex.McKenna-Coles wrote in the guide’s foreword: “Where once trans and non-binary people were less visible, more and more people are choosing new ways to express their gender identity.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties.”Suki Sandhu, the founder and chief executive of the ersity consultancy Involve, said: “It’s fantastic to see Lloyds of London proactively supporting and celebrating their trans and non-binary employees.“Guides such as this are a huge step in the right direction for creating inclusive and erse organisations, and means employees can be comfortable bringing their true selves to work.”“However, it doesn’t stop there. We need to see other companies follow in Lloyd’s of London’s footsteps and introduce more inclusive policies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac5a046433b0554db50a997d92173ca350f03e4e/0_92_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87ccf839506166cfb772c3c953cf7012","title":"uks most viewed home a footballers pad or stately house","story":"Rightmove’s annual top-five properties include a Downton Abbey-like castle and a star striker’s Towie pileThey are this year’s five most-viewed properties on the UK’s biggest house-selling website – from a Premier League footballer’s “wagtastic” Essex mansion to a castle that could double for Downton Abbey.Former West Ham footballer Andy Carroll scored top place in the 2019 Rightmove list of most-snooped-around properties with his Chigwell home, shared with his partner, Billi Mucklow, a star of the The Only Way Is Essex television show.Its 8,000 sq feet of zebra print walls, a sweeping marble staircase, mirrored-ceiling master bedroom and dark velour-clad cinema room went on the market in January with a £5m price tag.Located on Chigwell’s millionaire row, it includes a full-size football pitch, swimming pool and tennis court. Buyers can pop down to the nearby Sheesh restaurant, a celebrity haunt in a building owned by fellow Chigwell resident Lord Alan Sugar, where footballers Harry Kane and Rio Ferdinand have been pictured hanging out.But despite gaining 150,000 views on Rightmove, the property has yet to find a buyer after 11 months on the market.Footballers appear to have trouble selling their luxury pads, because the third most-viewed property on Rightmove is a triple-level penthouse occupying the 44th to 46th floors of Manchester’s Beetham Tower. It is understood to be owned by former Manchester United and England defender Phil Neville, now manager of the England women’s team. First listed on Rightmove in June 2017 for £4m, it has failed to find a buyer and the asking price is now £3.5m.It has four bedrooms, a chandelier cascading down a spiral staircase and views of Old Trafford. The agents describe it as “aspirational living at its best”. The current owner can at least comfort themselves with the rental income, believed to be around £15,000 a month.Fourth in the league of most-viewed properties on Rightmove was yet another home in top-flight football territory. Prestbury, a picturesque village in Cheshire’s “golden triangle” is home to Wayne Rooney and Peter Crouch.Overdale is a seven-bed mansion with spa, indoor pool and gym priced at £3.95m, but it too has hung around on the market for a long time, after first being listed in November last year. James Webster of agents Gascoigne Halman said: “We’ve had a couple of near-misses with buyers. It has been an interesting market this year what with Brexit and the election and there is considerable holding of breath until the outcome on Thursday night. I think after that we’ll see a lot more activity.”Castles were the other properties most sought after by professional snoopers. Glenborrodale Castle, a five-storey of the Scots baronial architectural style, was the second-most viewed home on Rightmove. But with a price tag of £3.75m the buyer will get rather more than a footballer’s palace apart from the 16 bedrooms there are 132 acres, a gate lodge, coach house and three islands.The fifth most-viewed property on Rightmove during the year was perhaps its most traditionally appealing: a 400-year-old grade I-listed country manor in Christow, about 12 miles southwest of Exeter. Priced at £3.95m, Canonteign Manor was taken for King Charles I and his troops during the English civil war and was built on land given to the canons of St Mary du Val in Normandy around 1125."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff188aa341b35d7eb5af69325971d8ad6decef3/0_154_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32792f93a7bc6c6de6f5a613fa57cb45","title":"bt to launch monthly pass sport content first time flexibility","story":"Firm acknowledges consumers’ preference for Netflix-type flexibility over long-term dealsBT is to launch a monthly pass allowing sport fans to watch content including Premier League and Champions League football without a contract for the first time, as viewers move away from high-priced, long-term deals towards the flexibility offered by streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix.BT has previously used its portfolio of rights, including Premiership Rugby, boxing and wrestling, as a carrot to lock consumers into contracts for broadband, phone and TV services.The new £25-a-month pass allows anyone to dip in and out of BT Sport without having to pay hundreds of pounds over an annual contract.Richard Broughton, an analyst at the media consultancy Ampere, said: “There is an increasing expectation in the market for flexibility, with long contract periods now off-putting to many consumers. It is also a nod to how competitive the market is getting.”Last week, Amazon successfully livestreamed its first 10 Premier League matches. The matches were accessible to subscribers to Amazon’s Prime service, which costs £7.99 a month or £79 a year, or were free to new customers on a 30-day trial. Amazon has said the two days on which matches were streamed set new records for the most signups to Prime since it was launched in the UK in 2007.Pete Oliver, the managing director of marketing at BT Consumer, said: “Customers can sign up on a flexible monthly basis for the first time.“Monthly pass forms part of BT’s ambition to offer BT Sport customers unrivalled choice and the highest-quality broadcasts on even more devices and platforms.”Sky began offering sport and entertainment on a pay-as-you-go basis seven years ago through its streaming service Now TV. The broadcaster has a range of daily, weekly and monthly passes without the need for a Sky TV subscription.Sky’s monthly sports pass is priced at £33.99. Offering a monthly pass has not resulted in a rush of cancellations by its core pay-TV base of about 10 million subscribers instead, it has primarily attracted a new set of “pay-lite” customers.Broughton said: “It is more risky offering sports monthly than film and TV content, because the timing of events opens the door to viewers waiting just for specific matches and then churning.“Given the high price of sports rights, it is a risky bet. Sky’s Now TV has mitigated the risk of contract customers moving to a ‘dip in and dip out’ culture by pricing the sports pass quite high in recognition that consumers have to pay for flexibility.”Netflix and Amazon have swiftly attracted 20 million UK subscribers between them. Last year, the number of subscribers to streaming services overtook those signed up to pay-TV providers such as Sky, BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media for the first time.Monthly cost of streaming services and pay-TV passesSky Sports pass – £33.99, reduced to £20 for the first two monthsAmazon Prime Video – £7.99, or £79 a yearBBC TV licence – £12.90 or £154.50 annually"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf19273f9fada2ab7bae4310d8449de52cd8af8/20_184_2955_1773/master/2955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7244958153a6d79d34e70908429e2f2","title":"saudi aramco soon worth 2tn dollars but looks plainly overvalued","story":"International investors doubting its true value are unlikely to be wowed by a stage-managed price inflationHere is a safe prediction: Saudi Aramco will soon formally be worth $2tn (£1.5tn), the valuation reputedly craved by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. It could happen by the end of this week.Second, vast financial resources have been assembled with the unofficial aim of getting to the round number. Wealthy Saudi families have been encouraged to buy more shares, the Financial Times reported (paywall). Meanwhile, speculating hedge funds will spy a quick turn from buying and then selling once $1.99tn is seen. Index funds are obliged to play since Aramco will soon be eligible for inclusion in the main emerging market indices. There is momentum to get over the line.Just don’t make the mistake of thinking $2tn will mean Aramco has wowed the investment world with its reserves, operational skill or even idend-paying capacity. Quite the reverse. This initial public offering is really only a triumph for the investment bankers’ art of making the best of a bad job.There’s no shame in keeping things local, but Riyadh is creating a long-term problem for itself. It still needs to get rid of far bigger chunks of Aramco to fund a ersification of the economy, and international investors will be required eventually.Those investors, though, are unlikely to be impressed by a stage-managed exercise in pumping up the valuation. If they thought Aramco’s real worth was $1.25tn, or thereabouts, they won’t trust the inflated price. The Saudis will hope scepticism will fade over time, but it’s hard to see why it should: Aramco looks plainly overvalued.Neither side in the great Tuesday night bust-up in M\u0026ampC Saatchi’s boardroom can claim the moral high ground.In one corner, there are the nominal victors, led by the chief executive, David Kershaw, and the chairman, Jeremy Sinclair. They occupy the top jobs in an advertising agency founded 24 years ago by escapees from Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi, and they’ve just seen the company’s value collapse by two-thirds in four months because financial controls weren’t up to scratch. Other bosses at other companies have been ditched for less, even when they’re co-founders.In the other corner stand the crew that resigned: Maurice Saatchi, a more famous co-founder, plus the entire collection of non-executives – Michael Dobbs, the author of the novel House of Cards, Sir Michael Peat, a former principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales, and Lorna Tilbian, a former media guru at Numis, the City firm that still serves as M\u0026ampC Saatchi’s adviser.Dobbs, Peat and Tilbian aren’t blameless because they comprised M\u0026ampC Saatchi’s audit committee. Peat, in particular, should be squirming with embarrassment about the £11.6m of “accounting misstatements” because he’s a former KPMG partner. As for Saatchi, it’s his name above the door, so he had more at stake than just his shareholding. He could have insisted years ago that the non-execs weren’t outnumbered in the boardroom.Forced to choose, though, one has to conclude that the wrong side won the showdown. Key executives should walk the plank first when things go spectacularly wrong. The non-execs were right to make that demand. It is also why the positions of Kershaw and Sinclair still look untenable in the medium term. Any self-respecting set of non-execs, old or new, would expect a clear-out.The Competition and Markets Authority’s logic is convoluted: even though Amazon doesn’t really compete with Deliveroo at the moment, an investment could still harm competition.There are two arguments here. First, Amazon did experiment with delivering fast food and might do so again if it were not distracted by the chance to grab a slice of Deliveroo. Second, both companies already provide an “ultra-fast” grocery convenience service and, even though the market is currently tiny, it might be big one day.A bit speculative? Yes, but let’s not complain.

But even as the Olympics recedes into the past, a new debate is now raging over what might be the most controversial proposal yet: the Madison Square Garden (MSG) Sphere.In March this year, MSG submitted a planning application for a spherical entertainment complex, 90 metres high and 120 metres wide, containing restaurants, shops, a nightclub and the centrepiece: a 21,500-capacity auditorium. The same diameter as the London Eye and almost as tall as Big Ben, the giant sphere will be covered 190,000 sq ft of LEDs, programmable to display images on the exterior.What MSG London executive vice-president Jayne McGivern describes as “a joyous ball of magic”, Newham councillor Harvinder Singh Virdee has called a “blob”, and another local activist “unprecedentedly monstrous”.The project has received support from the Newham Chamber of Commerce and representatives of nearby Newham College and the University of East London. Other residents are more concerned, and have formed a campaign group called Stop MSG Sphere. Their main objections regard noise and light pollution, increased traffic and the resulting rise in air pollution, anti-social behaviour, and strain on public transport and roads. There are also worries that it will block out natural light to homes, some of which are located only 50 metres away.Then there is the advertising. In the artists’ blueprints, the “skin” of LEDs displays wholesome scenes of the night sky or planet Earth, but the planning application allows for advertising, potentially presenting the opportunity for a kind of giant spherical version of Times Square or Piccadilly Circus.The Sphere would be located on triangular piece of land behind Stratford station. “It’s a densely populated residential area,” says Mace, “which is something that MSG have done their very best in their images and assessments to downplay: there are thousands of residential properties nearby.” MSG claim that impacts to the surrounding area will be minimal, pointing to the fact that the site is also surrounded by live railway lines. There have also been objections from Newham Council, which in July backed a report critical of the Sphere, and voted that it be submitted to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) for consideration. But activists point out that McGivern, who has been the public face of the company locally, was a board member of the LLDC from 2012-16.In November, campaigners also released correspondence between senior staff at the LLDC and MSG London, acquired through freedom of information requests, in which the two parties discussed the US company’s “strategy” to deal with “local resistance”. The emails also pointed to 33 unminuted meetings and apparently unrecorded hospitality for LLDC staff. MSG say there is nothing irregular or unusual in this.McGivern nevertheless cites the poll as a major indicator of support. “The poll demonstrates overwhelming local support for MSG Sphere, including for the thousands of jobs and significant economic impact this state-of-the-art entertainment and music venue would bring,” she said.“We are obviously delighted at this high level of excitement for the project and look forward to continuing to work with and listen to our local stakeholders.” The next consultation public consultation will be held on 16 December.The company is promoting the idea that London needs another music venue of that size. The planning application says the city “has an undersupply of dedicated large entertainment venues in comparison to other major world cities”, arguing that only SSE Arena in Wembley and the O2 in North Greenwich are capable of hosting the largest international touring acts. It points to New York, a similarly-sized city with seven such venues, though it does not mention London’s Alexandra Palace or its major park festivals – such as Hyde Park and Finsbury Park – which have capacities close to 100,000.MSG also claims that a smaller venue also included in the planning application, with a capacity of 1,500, and a 450-capacity nightclub will have a positive trickle-down effect on smaller music venues and local acts in London.Local skepticism, however, derives in part from the experience of hosting the Olympics, for which tens of thousands of jobs were promised by the LLDC that protesters pointed out this summer have still not materialised. “Obviously the Olympics left positives, like the park and the sports facilities,” Mace said. “But it has also left us with the LLDC, an unelected corporation without any real accountability, a planning authority for a lot of land that was previously under local authority control. Seven years on from the Olympics, what we’ve seen is lots of developments, with little visible benefit for local people.”What would be visible, of course, is the sphere itself, for miles around, an issue that Mace emphasises has not been properly discussed. “The size and illumination of it will be unprecedented – we believe in the UK, and quite possibly in Europe.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

The cheapest en-suite room available costs £135 a week, which adds up to £6,885 for a 51-week tenancy.The National Union of Students said its manifesto for the general election included a demand that the next government “tackle the spiralling costs of student accommodation and ensure rooms are accessible to all students”.The survey found that accommodation was cheaper in university-owned or operated accommodation or halls of residence, although that varied by location. London universities and colleges had the biggest gap between their rents and those of private providers, but still averaged around £7,500 a year.While the average private-sector en-suite rental outside London was £6,271 a year, similar university accommodation was only £80 a year lower."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0c181d8a430e6494c77d9fea6a1fe772527d814/0_58_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6ce1a20de258ab5469d7fe28498e58e","title":"on the front line of the climate emergency in pictures","story":"As COP25 takes place in Madrid, this collection of photographs from Getty Images highlights the climate crisis around the world, from Greenland’s melting ice sheets to rising seal levels in Alaska and Louisiana, the forest fires in the Amazon and Indonesia, and the impact of forests and the Lobster fishery in Maine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce5335926ded0d0e4f2abb0668b29002dd88f7b/0_227_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eadafc920f8d383a4afd8b1a184ef59","title":"harvey weinstein settlement women","story":"If approved, settlement would bring most of the civil lawsuits pending against him to an endMore than 30 women who were allegedly subjected to sexual misconduct by the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein have reportedly reached a $25m settlement which, if approved, would bring to an end most of the civil lawsuits pending against him.Harvey Weinstein himself would not have to pay a penny to his accusers or have to admit wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, the Times reports. The lack of personal accountability for the former movie producer has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved, though parties to the negotiations insist that the legal options open to them were limited.“I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him. I don’t know what I can really do,” the actor Katherine Kendall, who was allegedly sexually harassed by Weinstein in 1993, told the paper.The pending settlement in the multiple civil lawsuits is by no means the end of Weinstein’s legal woes. On 6 January his criminal trial is scheduled to open with jury selection in a Manhattan court.The criminal charges against him include the alleged rape of a woman in 2013 and an accusation of forced oral sex on a similarly unnamed woman in 2006. Weinstein has denied any claim of nonconsensual sex, criminal or civil.In August Weinstein was also charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault to allow a third woman, the actor Annabella Sciorra, to testify about an alleged rape in 1993. Though the statute of limitations has passed in that incident, prosecutors hope her testimony will demonstrate a pattern of behavior on the part of the defendant that will help secure his conviction.Weinstein has been free on bail since his arrest in May 2018. On Wednesday his bail conditions were raised from $1m to $5m after the prosecution accused him of tampering with his electronic ankle monitor.Lawyers for Weinstein, who arrived at court on Wednesday walking with the use of a frame, had claimed the irregular handling of the bracelet was innocently caused by “technical glitches”.The pending settlement in the civil lawsuits was revealed by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the two New York Times reporters who first broke the news of Weinstein’s long history of alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, sparking the #MeToo movement. The reporters went on to be awarded a Pulitzer prize and to write a bestselling book on the subject, She Said.Aspects of the tentative deal will probably be contentious and have already prompted angry responses from some of Weinstein’s alleged victims. In particular, more than $12m out of a total $47m package to close the Weinstein Company’s affairs would feed back to Weinstein himself along with his brother, Bob, and other board members to contribute to legal costs.According to the Times, two women involved in civil suits against the former producer, Alexandra Canosa and Wedil David, have refused to join the settlement and are challenging it.In a statement, Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for David, said: “We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims. It is shameful that $12m of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein.”He added: “We plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f3228fdf23bddd4fa64a28316c82a146df826d/0_186_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=565d30a6a4fe7e98b432ab78fc8d65f5","title":"pink wall review tom cullen tatiana maslany jay duplass","story":"Director Tom Cullen reshuffles events in an intimate drama about how the messiness of life jeopardises a new relationshipTom Cullen is the actor who had his breakthrough in Andrew Haigh’s contemporary romantic drama Weekend in 2011 now he makes an interesting and worthwhile debut as writer-director with Pink Wall, an intimate, scenes-from-a-relationship movie. We see various moments from various years in the time that a certain troubled couple are together, and the reshuffling of the narrative order somehow accentuates the poignant entropy as things fall apart.Jay Duplass plays Leon, an amiable, unambitious American guy in London with vague plans to become a photographer, but who likes hanging out in his flat cooking, listening to music and smoking weed, generally savouring the solo mood of directionless creativity and fun. (There’s a moment when, slightly loopy from solitude, he self-satirically calls out “Lovely balloons!” at something he’s seen out of the window and bursts out laughing. I did, too.)Leon falls in love with Jenna, who is exactly wrong for him or maybe exactly right. She is a formidably smart, professionally driven TV producer played by Tatiana Maslany, renowned for her bravura multi-personality performance in the BBC America sci-fi thriller Orphan Black, and with whom Cullen acted in a comparable film from 2016 called The Other Half. Jenna might herself have feelings for her best female friend that she has never entirely dealt with, and which get buried by the reality of this new heterosexual situation with Leon.Cullen shows that their entire relationship might stem from Jenna’s unexpressed gratitude for the piercingly important insight that Leon had into Jenna at the very beginning of their life together when they were just living a studenty existence, with no idea of the future. Leon tells Jenna that with her fierce focus and talent for organising people and making things happen, she should be a producer. And he is right. Inevitably, her career takes off, but he is becalmed, and issues about sexuality, monogamy and children become more difficult and painful.Perhaps the biggest moment of the film comes at the very beginning when, some way into their relationship, Leon and Jenna go out for a pub lunch with her mum and brother – the conversation is barrelling along pretty nicely and then takes a sudden, unexpected left turn. Duplass shows how Leon has been taken aback by something said and Maslany turns her character’s behaviour on a sixpence from cordiality to something very different.The faultline has been laid open for us. And the rest of the scene plays out in a break-upmake-up structure that is confidently presented by Maslany and Duplass but repeats elsewhere in the film, and is indicative of something slightly actor-ish about the drama.That isn’t to say there aren’t many great touches. I loved Leon and Jenna’s relationship opening up to the ecstatic accompaniment of the Meters’ Cissy Strut and Leon’s spacey interpretation of the music. And cinematographer Bobby Shore has an interesting closeup on Maslany in a party scene when Leon is regaling everyone with a bizarre anecdote about when he was a kid and was trying to look at his own anus in the bathroom with the help of a mirror and his dad walked in on him.Leon plays it as an outrageously and obviously funny story, but the shot of Jenna’s fractionally uncertain smile tells us something more complicated. Has she heard that anecdote before? Does she entirely like the performative side of Leon here? Has she, in fact, picked up on something that Leon doesn’t entirely realise: that this anecdote is part of a carefully curated and edited story about his relationship with his father, which was actually very unhappy?And so the drama zigzags back and forth along the timeline, culminating in a powerful exchange taking place on an outdoor hike. With some self-consciousness, Leon makes what he considers to be a lovely, relationship-saving gesture, intended to bring about what he (and we, the audience) might assume is the imminent happy ending. But that is not how it pans out, and I admired how Cullen tries to absorb the uncinematic messiness of real life.Pink Wall can be a bit contrived at times, with situations that have been rather effortfully created. But there are strong, forthright performances from Maslany and Duplass as the lovers who were never meant to be.• Pink Wall is released in the UK on 13 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3ab20a8c67ab21a0fdc0d956929553b4e327cc/0_65_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80ef03c46d3e73b0ec10ce220aecdedb","title":"roman polanski media making me a monster and its weinsteins fault","story":"Director claims rivalry over 2003 Oscars race reignited rape backlash, now further fuelled by fresh accusations and protests against new Dreyfus filmFilm director Roman Polanski has spoken out for the first time since fresh accusations of rape were made against him, declaring that the media were “trying to make me into a monster”.And in an extraordinary twist he blamed Harvey Weinstein for his woes, in an interview with Paris Match magazine published on Wednesday.He claimed that the disgraced Hollywood mogul tried to brand him a “child rapist” to stop him (unsuccessfully, it turned out) winning an Oscar in 2003 for The Pianist. Polanski – a fugitive from US justice since 1978 when he absconded after he admitting the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, Samantha Geimer – also dismissed the latest rape allegations against him as “absurd”.He said he “absolutely denied” beating and raping French photographer Valentine Monnier at his Swiss chalet in 1975.“Obviously I have no memory of it because it is false,” he told Paris Match magazine, before pouring scorn on her story. “Clearly accusing me of rape isn’t sensational enough any more, you have to add another layer.“I do not hit women,” he added.Monnier, who was an 18-year-old model and actress at the time, went public in Le Parisien as Polanski’s new film, An Officer and a Spy, was released in France last month. She alleged that Polanski also tried to give her a pill as he beat her “into submission”.But the director repeatedly ridiculed her claims as “aberrant” in the interview, before turning on Weinstein. He blamed the producer for starting a whispering campaign against him to sabotage his chances of an Oscar after The Pianist won best film and best director at the 2003 Bafta film awards.Weinstein was pushing his own film, Chicago, which won six Oscars including best picture.“It was him who dug up my case with Samantha Geimer from 26 years before which no one was interested in any more,” Polanski told Paris Match. The Pianist – which drew on some of Polanski’s own experiences as a Jewish child in Poland during the Holocaust – went on to win three Oscars, including best director.Polanski admitted the statutory rape of Geimer in a plea bargain in 1977 to avoid a trial on more serious charges. But he fled to France after serving 42 days in jail when it appeared a judge was reconsidering his release.Asked if he felt a victim of the saga, Polanski said that “for years they have been trying to make me into a monster”.The veteran film-maker caused outrage at the Venice film festival last August by comparing himself to the hero of his new film, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly punished by the French army at the turn of the 20th century.Polanski insisted that he was only speaking out now for the sake of his wife, French actress Emmanuelle Seigner, and his children.“I am used to the lies, my skin has thickened. But for my children and for Emmanuelle it’s appalling. They are suffering enormously. They are insulted and threatened on social media.“Of course I am responsible,” the 86-year-old told the magazine. “In 1977 I made a mistake and it is my family who are paying the price half a century later.”Polanski accused the media of treating him with “incredible violence”.“They seize on every new false accusation, no matter how absurd, because it lets them bring up this story. It is like a curse which keeps coming back and I can do nothing about.”Polanski also claimed that Geimer, who he was accused of drugging and raping at Jack Nicholson’s Los Angeles home, had suffered more from the press than anything he had done to her. “She and her family have suffered because of what I did, and despite me it continues,” he told Paris Match.Polanski is persona non grata in Hollywood, and cannot return to the US for fear of arrest. Despite being expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, he has been defended by many in the French film industry.Protesters in France forced several screenings of An Officer and a Spy to be abandoned. But the movie has become one of the most successful French films of the year, with more than 1.1 million flocking to see it in its first three weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfda791c5399bed039def656afd5cd23e94bcd6/947_927_3290_1975/master/3290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c11cfe4b7f9ab16f30b9f5bbb3783d","title":"from booths to greggs six food heroes that shaped the decade","story":"At the end of any decade, it is customary to reflect on what changed within it and who was responsible. This can be a vexed and controversial enterprise when you’re thinking about politics and trying to argue that it was all, say, Sarah Palin’s fault, but it needn’t tear us apart if we’re talking about food.The obvious place to start is with restaurants. The London-based foodieentrepreneur Jonathan Downey recently listed 12 of his heroes, including Dishoom (delicious), Viajante (totally rad) and Bao (testament to the enduring, universal love of anything at all when it’s stuffed in a tiny bap).We could each pick over the bones of that and compile our own Desert Island Starters, but I question whether or not single restaurants alter anyone’s eating habits all that much. Runaway success, for a restaurant, is either when it turns into a chain, or when people start copying, or both. The scene, however, is brutal, and the more modish the cuisine, the more likely it is to fold within a year, making scarcely a dent on the eating choices even of people who live next door to it.So, ignoring most restaurants except for exceedingly specific reasons, these are the six people or places that have changed, not necessarily the way I eat, but my foundational food assumptions over the past 10 years.I was about to say it’s not just the vegan sausage roll, because I remain a firm fan of the regular sausage roll. Also, the nacho slice. But in fact, it is just the vegan sausage roll, because it gave the lie to one of those tenacious myths of food, that trends are only for the trivial, the metropolitan elite, the faddists, the orthorexics. Veganism, said Greggs, is just a thing now. Not everybody has to do it. Some people prefer a steak bake. But we will not allow our baked goods to be dragged in to a culture war. There are pastries for everyone. Eat and let eat.Greggs had a profit boom afterwards, by the way: that’s how much we all agreed.It’s hard to explain what is so nourishing about this posh northern supermarket without just making it sound like Waitrose in the Lake District. Originally to reinforce its focus on food miles and sustainability, it names many of its suppliers once it has given, say, Tina Canipa a name, and you know she sells kippers, you feel pretty confident that she gets a fair price for them. That lingering feeling in any large supermarket that the Bogof offers and weirdly cheap milk have somebody paying a price, somewhere in the supply chain, vanishes.This is not a mass-market suggestion. It is two guys, Keith Sides and Philip Wilton, in north London, who taught themselves artisan cheesemaking after Wilton was made redundant. It’s often in cute shapes, and you may not even have heard of if it you don’t regularly shop at Fortnum \u0026amp Mason. However, they have revolutionised – for my money – the notion of what it takes to fabricate a special cheese. I used to think it was centuries of graft, local knowledge passed down, embedded in the landscape, a kind of dairy aristocracy that you had to be born into. Now I know that any thinking person with a passion for cheese and the patience to treat it right can build their own varieties from scratch. It’s a pleasing democratisation, while at the same time not at all cheap.It’s a slur on the snowflake millennials that they spend all their money on avocado and toast, and that’s why they can’t afford houses. Within it lurks utter scorn for fancy sourdoughs, the marching snack of the liberal elite, because honest people only eat Mother’s Pride, you see. But that slur has its economics arse backwards really good bread has turned a huge array of things that would once have been sides, if not garnishes, into actual meals – avocados, poached eggs, onions and anchovies.Spector did not invent the biome, but he did write the definitive guide to its health, The Diet Myth. Being a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College, London, he produced something with more heft than your average myth-buster. In his explanation of and emphasis on ersity in the gut, he turned a huge range of foods, many of them fermented, from curiosities into things you should definitely eat because they’re good for you. I have never had so much kimchi in a single decade.There is nothing unique about a food chain putting the accent on health, or sustainability, or packaging, or whatever it is that people might start a change.org petition about. I suppose the surprise is when it also tastes good. A little zoned-out while waiting for a train in Birmingham the other day, I accidentally picked up someone else’s Moroccan meatballs, when my own order was the lentil masala, except – here’s the kicker – I had already started my own box. So it wasn’t a mistake in the classic sense I knew the meatballs weren’t mine, but on some subconscious level, they smelled so good I decided they were. This is quite unusual on a station concourse. I believe Leon has raised the standards of the entire high street."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8b4984336e6c729d3afd9ad13b96ac00944ee99/247_366_4691_2814/master/4691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea6c1bfd4b76f76a7e16fd61de7e1e6","title":"sugar rush how dates went from rare luxury to healthfood sensation","story":"Strawberry sundae, carrot cake, lemon drizzle, berry delight … You can have any flavour of Nakd bar you like, as long as you like dates. Squished together into a caramelly goo, before being mixed with chopped nuts and dried fruit, flavoured with spices and shaped into bars, dates are the backbone of every product in the range. “We do actually call it date goo,” says the brand’s development manager, Mirka Butalova, holding an enormous log of it in her hands.Earlier, snapping on a par of latex gloves, Butalova had demonstrated how the company’s cacao and orange bar is made. You mix the dates with chopped cashew nuts and raisins, and add cacao powder and orange essence before smushing the whole thing and shaping it into bars. It looks exactly like Play-Doh. I can’t figure out if I want to play patty-cake with it or eat it.Not so long ago, dates were an exotic luxury rarely seen in the UK. Perhaps they would be eaten at Christmas, scrawny and puckered in polystyrene packaging, bearing scant resemblance to their voluptuous medjool peers. In Middle Eastern households, such as the one I grew up in, dates are ever-present, arranged on silver platters ready to be served to visiting guests with hot sweet tea. Now, the whole of the UK has gone gaga for them – even if it is more as an ingredient than as a delicious treat in its own right.The woman who probably kickstarted our obsession with dates is Sarah Britton, the Canadian writer behind the healthy recipe blog My New Roots. Her 2011 recipe for raw brownies – medjool dates, walnuts, cacao, almonds and sea salt – was the first to use dates as a sugar substitute and has been widely imitated – a Google search for “date brownies” returns some 40m results. “It has been redone so many times,” Britton says. She devised the recipe while working at a raw food restaurant in Copenhagen. “I think it’s so popular because it’s so easy to make. If you have a food processor, you can do it. It’s a super-satisfying treat that’s good for you.”Yet the halo effect around dates can encourage overconsumption. “At the end of the day, the sugar in dates is sugar,” warns the dietitian Priya Tew. “It is easier to view these foods as healthier and eat them in larger amounts because of this, which could lead to you consuming more sugar and calories than you would in a regular brownie.”You can see the obsession with dates as symptomatic of our modern-day anxieties around food. The wellness industry has been criticised for encouraging disordered eating, and the perception that there are “clean” or “unclean” foods. “There is no such thing as a ‘guilt-free’ food, because no food is bad for you,” says Eve Simmons of the anti-diet-culture blog Not Plant Based. Instead of finding ways to make brownies healthier using dates, Simmons thinks that you should just eat a regular brownie. “Studies show that the more we deny ourselves certain food, or categorise food as ‘good’ and ‘bad’, the more likely we are to develop an unhealthy relationship with it.”And there are ethical considerations that may escape many health-conscious foodies.The date palm tree flowers across the Middle East and north Africa, with every date-producing region fiercely proud of its crop. (Although medjool dates are the best-known, purists prefer black-brown Iranian piarom dates for their richer flavour.)Yasmin Khan, author of Zaitoun: Recipes and Stories from the Palestinian Kitchen, explains that dates are central to many Middle Eastern cultural rituals: you feed dates to a woman after she has given birth, and break your fast during Ramadan with a date. Every Middle Eastern home will have a box somewhere.She has watched with enthusiasm the popularity of dates explode in recent years (“There is something so comforting about dates”) but also some concern. “I find it wonderful that wellness embraces traditional Middle Eastern ingredients such as pomegranates, tahini and dates, but I also find it frustrating, because food doesn’t exist in a vacuum. All food reflects the social and political context in which it is grown.”Dates are grown in some of the most contested land in the world. Seventy per cent of the dates grown by Israeli settlers on Palestinian land in the West Bank are exported internationally, although the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign urges consumers to avoid such goods.Khan urges western consumers to think carefully about the provenance of their dates. “We shouldn’t celebrate certain aspects of Middle Eastern culture while remaining silent on the issues facing people in the Middle East.” Khan herself buys Palestinian dates, which are darker in colour, as Palestinian farmers have less water to irrigate their crops. “I eat them every day,” she says. “They’re a great snack food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ccbb7f6fc20b81d33fdd2cd286172b0db0e67fe/28_87_1894_1136/master/1894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9515589f8b7156def3d95172a8f2612c","title":"atletico madrid lokomotiv moscow champions league match report","story":"Atlético Madrid had taken 62 shots without scoring a goal, including the Kieran Trippier penalty that had hit the post 15 minutes earlier, when João Félix finally put the ball into the net to set them on their way to the last 16 of the Champions League. The 20-year-old striker slotted Atlético’s second spot-kick beyond Anton Kochenkov to finally rid Diego Simeone’s side of the anxiety he admitted they were suffering, effectively ending this game and averting a European disaster.That was the first of two goals, Felipe later adding a second on a cold but ultimately comfortable night when Lokomotiv Moscow mustered a solitary shot on target. It had come after 17 minutes.Atalanta won 3-0 away to Shakhtar Donetsk to take second place in Group C – despite losing their first three group games by an aggregate score of 11-2.Needing a win to progress with Dinamo Zagreb losing to Manchester City, the Italian side went ahead in the 69th minute when Timothy Castagne poked the ball home at the second attempt.\u0026nbspShakhtar\u0027s chances of an equaliser were hit by a red card for Dodo, before late goals from Mario Pasalic and Robin Gosens sealed an unexpected last-16 place in their debut Champions League campaign.PSG completed a dominant group stage with a 5-0 win over Galatasaray, with five different players finding the net.

Late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín – both set up by Paulo Dybala – and Atlético Madrid\u0027s win over Lokomotiv Moscow ended Leverkusen\u0027s faint hopes of qualifying.In Group B, Olympiakos defeated Red Star Belgrade 1-0 to snatch a Europa League place in a game of two penalties. Tomané missed his spot-kick for Red Star, before Youssef El Arabi converted late on for the hosts.The game was two minutes in when Trippier failed to score the penalty that would have settled Atlético sooner. Ultimately, it did not matter, but at that point it felt like it might.Atlético knew failure to win would leave them at the mercy of the group’s other game, Bayer Leverkusen against Juventus. Under normal circumstances that might not have concerned them – Lokomotiv were missing their first-choice goalkeeper, two of their best players and were already out, the sad sight of Vedran Corluka carried off with a suspected broken ankle the only moment of real consequence for them – but these were not normal circumstances. Atlético arrived having not scored in four hours and winning one game in eight.Fifty-nine shots had gone by without a goal when they were presented with their 60th and their best opportunity yet. Forty-four seconds in, Félix was brought down. Trippier took responsibility, lining up to score his first Atlético goal. Seeing the Englishman there surprised, although it said something too. The penalty was hit reasonably well but Kochenkov, ing right and off his line, raised his left hand and palmed the shot off the post.Fatalism could be forgiven. Even from the spot, they might have felt, there was no way to score. But there was an inescapable reality here: Atlético are far better than Lokomotiv. They kept coming, Trippier as determined as ever to advance, and they racked up another 11 shots by half-time, Félix, Ángel Correa and Thomas Partey coming closest.By then they had the goal, getting the breakthrough when the referee, Viktor Kassai, was called to the VAR screen, which revealed Rifat Zhemaletdinov’s handball. This time it was Félix took it, his shot rolling in by the same post Trippier had hit.Álvaro Morata thought he had made it 2-0 soon after but what VAR had given, VAR took away, ruling it out for offside.On the pitch, Atlético were not to be denied. Koke’s cross was neatly volleyed in by Felipe early in the second half.Morata headed just over, the ball clipping the bar, and Thomas flashed just past the post, but they had to settle for two and second place in group D. For the record, they had taken 23 shots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a3334e217935c355b9ad83e9e19fb9d4339bc08/0_176_3977_2387/master/3977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a2a588b73db258349034cee1c7cbd6","title":"bayern munich tottenham hotspur champions league match report","story":"José Mourinho rested key players with Tottenham already certain to finish this Champions League group in second place and the manager had wanted the club’s fringe players to show their ability to give him one or two selection headaches for the Premier League challenges ahead.First the good news. Ryan Sessegnon, on his first Spurs start, showed flickers of his pace on the left wing, worked diligently in defensive terms, made good decisions and enjoyed a moment he will never forget when he lashed home the equaliser for 1-1. Sessegnon had plenty of time to feel the hammer of his heart but he concentrated purely on the cleanness of the finish. It flew past Manuel Neuer from 12 yards, beating the Germany World Cup-winner at his near post.Yet the positives for Mourinho were hardly abundant in supply and he could feel a small dent to the feelgood factor that had built up over the first five games of his tenure.Bayern Munich were too good, even without Robert Lewandowski, who was rested. Happily for Spurs, this was not another shellacking to follow the 7-2 in October. But there was the impression that the home team had played within themselves and still managed to highlight weaknesses in the Spurs rearguard, particularly on the flanks, where Kyle Walker-Peters and Danny Rose endured difficult evenings.Kingsley Coman, Thomas Müller, who came on as a substitute, and the excellent Philippe Coutinho scored the goals and Bayern will be intimidating opponents in the knockout rounds, despite their domestic struggles. For Spurs, the attention turns to Sunday’s visit to Wolves, which will be followed by the home game against Chelsea a week later. Mourinho made the point this was more akin to an information-gathering exercise.“Today was play and prepare a game when you put more emphasis on the players who rest than the players who play,” he said. “I try to hide that feeling but the players are intelligent guys and they understand my focus was not on today. My focus was on what next.Everything was fixed beforehand in terms of the group permutations, with Spurs knowing that they will be paired with Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig or Valencia in the last 16. Playing the second leg away from home represents a big disadvantage in Mourinho’s eyes but if Spurs could get through to the open draw for the quarter-finals he feels anything could happen.Atalanta won 3-0 away to Shakhtar Donetsk to take second place in Group C – despite losing their first three group games by an aggregate score of 11-2.Needing a win to progress with Dinamo Zagreb losing to Manchester City, the Italian side went ahead in the 69th minute when Timothy Castagne poked the ball home at the second attempt.\u0026nbspShakhtar\u0027s chances of an equaliser were hit by a red card for Dodo, before late goals from Mario Pasalic and Robin Gosens sealed an unexpected last-16 place in their debut Champions League campaign.PSG completed a dominant group stage with a 5-0 win over Galatasaray, with five different players finding the net.

Tomané missed his spot-kick for Red Star, before Youssef El Arabi converted late on for the hosts.It was disappointing to see how flat Spurs were at the outset, how lacking in intensity they were and Bayern took a grip. They went close when Benjamin Pavard drew a sharp save out of Paulo Gazzaniga and Thiago Alcântara could not smuggle home the rebound, and the breakthrough followed shortly afterwards. Serge Gnabry’s low cross deflected off Moussa Sissoko to fall kindly for Kingsley Coman, who beat Gazzaniga with a composed finish. Coman would be forced off with an injury.At 1-0, it was possible to fear for Spurs. Apart from one Sessegnon burst and shot, they had offered nothing. But they were settled by his goal, which followed a ball from Giovani Lo Celso that was deflected on its way through. The 19-year-old, whose integration after his £25m summer move from Fulham has been delayed because of injury, felt a rush of emotion when his shot ripped past Neuer, although Mourinho would take a tough-love line with him.“He always arrives in dangerous positions and he is a good finisher,” he said. “He can improve. He lost too many inidual duels. He has a lot to develop but the potential is there.”Spurs may have led on 33 minutes had Sissoko not fluffed the final ball when well placed but they always looked vulnerable at the back. They rode their luck when Alcântara missed an open goal after Gnabry’s shot had come back off the post but they were soon behind again. Gnabry’s cross deflected off Toby Alderweireld the impressive Alphonso Davies’s shot hit the post and Müller stabbed home. The half-time damage might have been worse, with Coutinho denied by the crossbar from 25 yards.One of Mourinho’s laments has been the lack of time he has had with his players, how he must develop his style “while we are running”. It felt like that here, with Spurs lacking cohesion. Eric Dier and Sissoko struggled to set any kind of tone in possession from central midfield while Christian Eriksen only came into the game in the closing stages.Coutinho’s goal for 3-1 was a lovely curler from the edge of the box and although the Spurs substitute, Son Heung-min, twice went close following Eriksen passes, the die had been cast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ce9c2677753b2ad86740161c49fcc058d9bf14/0_209_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ed2b43862ebec2b7e7ff026772ac4bd","title":"dinamo zagreb manchester city champions league match report","story":"Jesus said: “When I was young, I’d think about the Champions League. It’s a very special moment when I score and a hat-trick as well.”With Phil Foden pulling the strings – and Dinamo Zagreb around – from midfield Jesus had admirable support on a night when Benjamin Mendy also gave a reminder of why he was signed.City were already in the last 16 as Group C winners but required a morale-boosting victory after a dire run of form. For this challenge Guardiola retained Rodri, Jesus and Ilkay Gündogan from Saturday’s loss to Manchester United, made Foden’s 50th City appearance a fourth start this term and handed Eric García a full debut in the competition.All that meant this outing might not be the best barometer of form and mood. Yet the way Nicolás Otamendi lost Dani Olmo before he volleyed Damian Kadzior’s ball past Claudio Bravo was the latest addition to a catalogue of defensive calamities. The finish was supreme but caused more questions regarding a rearguard who have now kept one clean sheet in their past 12 matches.For a packed Stadion Maksimir this was the dream beginning – City fans apart – as Zagreb required victory to retain any chance of qualification. For the visitors it was poor, but Foden zipped the ball through midfield allowing City to launch the quick attacks Guardiola desires.Atalanta won 3-0 away to Shakhtar Donetsk to take second place in Group C – despite losing their first three group games by an aggregate score of 11-2.Needing a win to progress with Dinamo Zagreb losing to Manchester City, the Italian side went ahead in the 69th minute when Timothy Castagne poked the ball home at the second attempt.\u0026nbspShakhtar\u0027s chances of an equaliser were hit by a red card for Dodo, before late goals from Mario Pasalic and Robin Gosens sealed an unexpected last-16 place in their debut Champions League campaign.PSG completed a dominant group stage with a 5-0 win over Galatasaray, with five different players finding the net. Mauro Icardi, Pablo Sarabia, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé all struck before Edinson Cavani\u0027s late penalty.Elsewhere in Group A, Real Madrid were pegged back by Club Brugge before goals from Vinícius Júnior and Luka Modric sealed an away win. Rodrygo\u0027s half-volley put the visitors ahead early in the second half, before Hans Vanaken equalised two minutes later.Juventus completed an unbeaten Group D campaign with a 2-0 win at Bayer Leverkusen. Late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín – both set up by Paulo Dybala – and Atlético Madrid\u0027s win over Lokomotiv Moscow ended Leverkusen\u0027s faint hopes of qualifying.In Group B, Olympiakos defeated Red Star Belgrade 1-0 to snatch a Europa League place in a game of two penalties. Tomané missed his spot-kick for Red Star, before Youssef El Arabi converted late on for the hosts.An angled pass to Mendy allowed the left-back to whip in a cross that had Jesus leaping and Dominik Livakovic punching away just in time.Olmo may have scored once more when running through – Otamendi again could not get near him – but he blasted his shot over. Next Olmo’s flick found Mislav Orsic and this time Bravo saved the header.What City had lacked in the run of two wins in seven matches was quality in the boxes, as Guardiola says. An illustration of what was required came via the equaliser. Riyad Mahrez swept the ball into the back post from the right and Jesus was lethal with his head: simple and effective. That made him the youngest Brazilian, at 22 years and 252 days, to hit 10 Champions League goals, beating Neymar’s previous mark.The goal angered Zagreb, though, as Emir Dilaver had gone down during the build-up but while players surrounded Carlos del Cerro Grande, the referee ruled it legitimate and booked Arijan Ademi for his part in the protest.This was an admirable riposte from City in a hostile venue and ensured the score was level at half-time: the break came at an apt time as the ill-feeling continued when Amer Gojak may have been sent off, but was not even booked, for an elbow on Rodri near the touchline. At this juncture City were ensuring unbeaten progress to the next round and Zagreb were going out. Yet City pride themselves on winning intent and this was signalled by a Foden shot that, although high, warned their hosts.Next they carried the threat through via some delightful footwork from Jesus. Foden’s slick ball-play put the striker in near goal and after some Fred Astaire-like feet he allowed Livakovic no chance with his finish.This had Guardiola double-fist pumping and posed a question of Zagreb they would surely find difficult to answer. So it proved as the excellent Foden fed Mendy and his equally impressive cross was stabbed in by Jesus for his third. From here it was a keep-ball exercise for City before Foden scored a deserved late fourth for a team who could be proud of the character shown.On Monday, City will find out who they face. “We will all watch the draw together,” said Guardiola. “This competition is weird but hopefully we arrive in good spirits in February.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/984063e0dd61299b605fd0274d92c6917b32f115/14_39_2532_1519/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a682898386e0fde37769180d3a66db","title":"champions league last 16 four english teams hegemony superclub era","story":"For the third year in a row all the Premier League clubs are in last 16, with Manchester City perhaps the most likely winnersWell, fancy seeing you here. For all the pep and vim, the high-energy caffeine-football combinations of Red Bull Salzburg, there was a feeling of certainty about Liverpool’s progress to the last 16 of the Champions League.The ability of Jürgen Klopp’s team to win even when the opposition bring their A-game has been a feature of the season. A simple explanation, beyond luck and “LiVARpool” conspiracy theory, is that their base levels are just so high. This is a team of extreme qualities: physical strength, speed, attacking skills. They have more ways to win, more ways to wear you down, like a heavyweight champ who can dawdle through five rounds and still produce at any stage that lights-out right-hander.At the end of which victory for Liverpool on Tuesday, combined with Chelsea’s defeat of Lille at Stamford Bridge, was significant in other ways. Four English teams out of four will enter the draw for the last 16 of the Champions League. It is a full house completed with a match-day to spare, making it three years in a row that no English team has failed to reach the knockout stages.Even here there is a degree of uniformity. The same four teams, with the addition of Manchester United, have occupied the Premier League spots across that three-year period.For the first time, teams from Europe\u0027s \u0027big five\u0027 leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1) have claimed every available place in the Champions League knockout rounds.\u0026nbspFour English sides (Chelsea, Spurs, Man City and Liverpool) will join four Spanish teams, three from Germany, three from Italy and two from France in the draw at 11am GMT on Monday 16 December.The eight teams who finished third in their groups: Club Brugge, Olympiakos, Shakhtar Donetsk, Leverkusen, Red Bull Salzburg, Internazionale, Benfica, Ajax.It is all part of a wider trend. Worried about the anticompetitive effects of a conference-style European super league, about the oligarchical giants seizing the means of production (sorry, Gazprom!), about the grabbing hands grabbing all they can? Don’t fret. We’re already there anyway. Well, almost. Eleven of the top 16 richest clubs in Europe are in that Champions League last 16.Look down the Uefa rankings and the only missing faces are Arsenal, Sevilla, Manchester United, Roma and Porto, none of whom made it to the group stages, excluded from the top table by the pesky uncertainties of sporting competition.The only real surprises in the post-Christmas lineup are the elimination of Ajax, ranked 21 in Europe, at the hands of Valencia, ranked 28 and the ousting of Benfica, ranked 20, by Zenit St Petersburg, ranked 22. RB Leipzig are the only real outsiders, ranked 43 by Uefa and a fine example of corporate “disruption”, a startup team, brilliantly run and managed, but a piece of ambush marketing as much as a long-treasured sporting dream.Does any of this matter? It is 28 seasons since European football set itself on this path with the abandonment of the old format. The chief effect has been the kind of economic common market Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn preached against, a feat of uber-capitalism whereby superclub corporations are born and stronger markets allowed to dominate the small and the weak.There were 16 different flags in the last 16 of the final European Cup. That had fallen to 10 by 2015-16, to seven last season and even fewer this time. Ajax provided the perfect case study this season. Semi-finalists last year, a team built on good husbandry and good practice, but deprived instantly of their two best players by the Euro giants and demoted at a stroke to also-rans.Again, does any of this matter? Perhaps not as much as it might at first glance. For one thing the Premier League has only really found its stride in the last two seasons. These cycles come and go, based more often in details and good management. The more remarkable part of the last quarter century is how competitive European football still is at that top end, how resilient it remains.Plus of course a high-class football team is a thing of beauty however it comes into being. The transformation of Chelsea from dour oligarch’s trinket to exemplar of youth, parsimony and exuberant football has been an enforced act of alchemy. But the team who beat Lille featured eight different nationalities, three academy products and have been a joy to watch this season.Similarly Tottenham have spent £120m, net, in the last four years, have been brilliantly well-managed and are shot through with homegrown players. Liverpool’s ascent provides a more salutary kind of model: enlightened management crossed with unanswerable finances and a powerful, geographically rooted sense of identity. You don’t have to be a financial juggernaut to dominate European club football but it helps if you’re also an exceptionally well-run football machine.Of these three clubs Chelsea look the most vulnerable over two legs at this level, a team who attack with abandon and often defend the same way. The presence of José Mourinho at Spurs has been hailed as an elevation to instant European dark horse status, which tends to overlook the fact Mourinho has mustered one losing semi-final in the last six years.Liverpool clearly have it in them to win this competition again, although it would involve pushing the boundaries: no English club has retained the European Cup since Nottingham Forest 39 years ago. No English club has ever done so while winning the league the same year.Manchester City have perhaps the most intriguing route from here. City’s support may not be sold on the Uefa dream but their manager retains an obsession with this competition. The team will get stronger as Aymeric Laporte and Leroy Sané return, as Fernandinho slips back into midfield, and as the focus narrows in spring. The poverty of their recent defending may suggest otherwise. But for various reasons City are perhaps the most likely English winners.Getting there will be tough but not as tough as it has been. Many of the traditional heavyweights look a little haggard. Barcelona still have the greatest club footballer of all time on their books. Juventus have the tools to beat anyone. Real Madrid are, as ever, Real Madrid. But right now Paris Saint-Germain are perhaps the team to beat, provided Neymar and Kylian Mbappé stay fit and functional and provided they can find the right blend in front of a thrillingly powerful midfield.Much can change before February. For now the Premier League can bask once again in its own good health not to mention another full hand of four from four, achieved this time with a lack of jeopardy that speaks to the strength and depth, the high-functioning quality of the product."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad88fd33ba859197f16fbfe38eba72e5f6671727/0_9_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22ea88bb53a282a3263380d9ef461726","title":"hannah dines on going public with her labia surgery it started a big conversation","story":"The Paralympic cyclist wrote about the damage the sport had caused her. The article caused an outcry, others with similar experiences contacted her – and manufacturers finally began designing saddles for womenThe day after I wrote in the  about how my life as a female cyclist, and Paralympian, led to me having reconstructive surgery of my vulva – all because saddles are not designed for women – a book arrived in the post. It was The Vagina Bible by Dr Jen Gunter. It was a gift from my mum, who had read the searing details about my labial surgery. She has always had a good sense of humour.The response from other people was overwhelming. That is the thing when you share – people share back. When the first professional cyclist contacted me to tell me she had gone through the same thing, the relief was so profound that I cried. I can now say with certainty that there are other people like me who, due to the wrong kind of pressure, experienced a cycle of chronic inflammation and swelling. These are people for whom cycling is as necessary to life as breathing and they face an impossible dilemma.There was an awkward moment when I turned up for my gym session to the sound of Greg James interviewing me on Radio 1 about my vulva. The media furore was so huge, so unexpected and went on for so long that I began hoping the fame might go away.What happened next, though, was that I became the UK’s unofficial agony aunt for saddle trauma. Writing about my surgery started a conversation where there was silence before. Thanks to more female staff in cycling team environments, more social media groups, more newspaper articles, more doctors who listen and give you choice, and manufacturers that admit there might be a problem with their products, prevention is in sight.The professional US cyclist Alison Tetrick had the same surgery as me. She pushed her sponsor, Specialized, to take seriously the problems women on her team were having with their saddles. A two-year research project led to the only saddle I can now use without pain (the Power Saddle with Mimic technology). We are holding our breath for Specialized’s forthcoming 3D-printed saddle technology – basically a carbon cast of your bottom that should ensure all lumps and bumps are accounted for. It would be remiss not to stress that saddles are designed with men in mind. That is why an inidually customisable solution holds so much hope. Saddles can fail anyone. Yet women already face a data gap, as is so evident in Caroline Criado Perez’s book Invisible Women, and we can no longer ignore it. Accessing effective medical treatment is harder and solutions are more expensive. Bike parts, technological developments and racing procedures are all geared towards men.Jasmijn Muller is an ultra-endurance racer and winner of the World 24-hour TT Championships. When I asked her to rate her saddle comfort since having her second of two vulval surgeries at the end of 2018, the answer was 1010. This year, she has perfected her bike position, dealt with saddle pressure and even has special inserts in her shoes. Her battle was slightly different from mine – a recurring bacterial infection that was so bad it was tracking down her legs and up to her stomach. She is soon to be a coach. I am excited by this. A few of us were told by cycling mentors that what we were experiencing was normal. I wonder what the world would be like if every coach was like Muller.I wrote about my surgery because I wanted friends in this fight. Now I have them. Since the article was published, I have presented at the British Lymphology Society’s annual conference and there is now a dedicated clinic in London for swelling-related saddle trauma. There are saddle-pressure projects running at Dundee and Manchester universities and I am attempting to form a network of all surgeons who have performed the relevant procedures in hopes that, one day, there will be a go-to best-practice guide.Oh, and I won a bronze World Cup medal and crashed out at the world championships. I will leave you with my favourite Phoebe Waller-Bridge skit for Saturday Night Live. “Think about how many of them are in this room, right now. Just think about all the genitals, all across America, sat on couches right now,” she said. The genitals that are still being crushed into oblivion on bike saddles. But I’m so glad we can talk about it.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Now a fashion commentator and lecturer, her experiences mean she’s learned plenty over the years.Nobody is judging you, trust meI’ve definitely observed a change over the years in myself – I’m less bothered by what others think. I’ve learned that most people are concerned with their own lives and are too busy thinking about their own stories. When we’re younger we don’t realise that, and that realisation is quite liberating.Use clothes to tell a storyI’ve always had a real interest in clothes and the way they can talk on our behalf. I learned very early on that I could earn myself a certain amount of notoriety at school if I got sent home for not wearing the uniform. I’ve always known what I wanted to wear and why, and have always respected the power of clothes. If I’m doing a job, for example, I put on clothing that speaks to others in terms of my creativity and professionalism – it’s a costume. Think about what you want to convey and what it is you want people to know about you.Your definition of success might change (and that’s OK)Now, my definition is very simple: if I can learn, pay my bills and have fun, then I see myself as very successful. Most days, I can do two out of those three things, so as far as I’m concerned I’m extremely successful! I think that’s realistic and allows me to be the person I need to be.Connections are better in personWorking as a fashion editor in the 1980s meant I became very good at networking. We didn’t have social media, so we had to network in real life. I’m big on real-life meetings instead of phone calls or emails, whether it’s work or socialising – you get so much more than you bargained for. Nowadays, I like socialising in small groups over a drink rather than big, noisy rooms, so I can make a connection. The older I get, the more I value making connections, no matter how simple.Ageing is the best thing that will happen to youGetting older is brilliant. I’ve been thrilled with the intellectual growth I’ve experienced, the way my perceptions and motivations have changed and the knowledge I’ve gained about myself and what it is to be human. I’ve really learned to enjoy life and prioritise the things that matter. I had a seminal experience in my 20s – my boyfriend (who became the father of my eldest daughter) was diagnosed with a very serious illness and became very ill. It was a valuable lesson and I felt lucky my body was functional. Maybe that’s why I’ve never given myself a hard time about my appearance.Ignore trends and avoid fast fashionAs the oldest of five children, my mother made my clothes as a child because it was cheaper than buying them. I was into customising early and would change the clothes she made me to suit my style, and help me express myself. My advice to anyone reading this now is the same: buy less and really look after it. Swap clothes, avoid fast fashion and learn to make or customise your own looks. Ignore trends. Wear what makes you happy and feel like you.Make social media work for youSocial media can be useful – I often use it for research and contacting people. I tell students I lecture that it’s like a car: if it’s being driven by someone carefully then it can be a great tool, but if it’s driven by someone who is irresponsible who then creates an accident, it can be very bad. It really depends on the driver, so always consider how you’re using it.Confidence and authenticity come with ageTo me, being authentic means being honest – accepting who I am and not pretending to be someone else, and that really does get easier with age. I was always authentic when I was younger, but I thought I wasn’t good enough and would constantly compare myself with others. But every one of us is authentic. Having the confidence to display your unique voice instead of hiding it or trying to suppress it, that comes with age. When you grow into yourself, you stop seeking other people’s opinions and trust your own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76ae8407481aa68670ede95f1393561d1656535/1382_982_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d3facf5c4c69f5a21e4406456f5be18","title":"bbc denies political editors postal vote comments broke law","story":"Broadcaster’s political editor said on air that ballots in so far were looking ‘grim’ for LabourThe BBC has said its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, did not break electoral law when she reported claims that postal ballots painted a “grim” picture for Labour.Kuenssberg told viewers on Wednesday that while parties were not supposed to look at voting papers when they were verified – but not counted – at opening sessions, they did “get a hint” of how they were doing and it was not looking good for Labour.She said: “The forecast is that it’s going to be wet and cold tomorrow. The postal votes, of course, have already arrived. The parties – they’re not meant to look at it, but they do kind of get a hint – and on both sides people are telling me that the postal votes that are in are looking pretty grim for Labour in a lot of parts of the country.“Of course, postal voters tend to skew to elderly voters and people who vote early … but the kind of younger generation who we know skew much more to the Labour party, you might expect to turn out to the polls tomorrow. But in this winter election, turnout is just another one of these factors that we just can’t predict.”Video of her remarks, made during an interview on the BBC’s Politics Live programme, was widely shared on social media on the final day of an election campaign that has seen unprecedented criticism of the media. It led to suggestions that she could potentially have breached the Representation of the People Act, which prevents the reporting of how people voted until after polls close.A spokesperson for the broadcaster made clear they did not believe there were any issues with the on-air comments. “The BBC does not believe it, or its political editor, has breached electoral law,” they said.Party candidates and agents can observe postal votes being verified before polling day but the ballot papers are placed face down and are not counted until polls close on election day.In reality, political parties regularly use the verification process as an opportunity to try to ine information on how they are performing in constituencies and adjust tactics in the final days of the campaign. This week BuzzFeed News reported claims that a northern Labour official had told colleagues that “postal votes in all Labour seats are bad” and ordered activists to stay in so-called defensive seats already held by the party. In 2010 the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy infamously tweeted the result of the postal votes in her Bristol East constituency, for which she received a caution from the police.The Electoral Commission issued a statement on Wednesday warning against revealing results. “It may be an offence to communicate any information obtained at postal vote opening sessions, including about votes cast, before a poll has closed. Anyone with information to suggest this has happened should report it immediately to the police,” it said. has learned that Waltham Forest council in east London has been scrambling to deliver postal votes that should have been out by last Friday, after an administrative error delayed the process.The problem affected 1,470 voters in three constituencies, including Chingford and Woodford Green, which Iain Duncan Smith won for the Conservatives with a majority of 2,438 at the last election and which is a key target for Labour.The council could not say how many voters were affected in each constituency but said all but one form had now been delivered.It said 1,364 forms had been hand-delivered by the end of Monday and 105 more had been couriered to voters outside London on Tuesday and Wednesday.A council spokesman said the borough had dealt with 27,993 postal votes for this election. He apologised for the error and said the Electoral Commission had been notified.He added: “Completed postal votes will get to us if they are posted by last post on Wednesday 11 December. They can also be handed to staff at any polling station in the constituency on the day of the general election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

A light wind was blowing from the south and little whirls of fine snow, as fine as dust, would occasionally sweep round the tents and along the sides of the sledge-runners, streaming away almost like smoke to the northward,” he wrote in his 1921 memoir, South with Scott.“Inside the tents breathing heavily were our eight sleeping figures – in these little canvas shelters soon after 4am the sleepers became restless and occasionally one would wake, glance at one’s watch and doze again.“At exactly 5am our leader shouted: ‘Evans’, and both of us with that name replied: ‘Right-o, sir.’ Immediately all was bustle, we scrambled out of our sleeping bags, only the cook remaining in each tent.

This general election campaign has officially been going on since around the mid-cretaceous period. Its final day saw an update to the list of things you shouldn’t keep in the fridge, with the likes of honey, potatoes and avocados now joined by “the UK prime minister”. All the party leaders embarked on a frantic cross-country campaigning dash on Wednesday, but only one of them … no, I’m sorry. I can’t face it yet. Give it a minute.At dawn, Boris Johnson embarked on a sort of softcore Confessions of a Prime Minister tour, which by 10am had already seen him dress up as a milkman, then pop something in someone’s oven. What next? Pool boy? Cable guy? At this rate of innuendo it seemed reasonable to assume Johnson would simply be barebacking grateful activists live on the lunchtime news. Of course, his version of all this does subvert the classic porn trope. Traditionally, it’s a blue-collar guy coming to the suburban professional’s house while he’s out at work. In this case, it’s an old Etonian milkman knocking on the door of working-class homes. Someone’s certainly going to get screwed, but not in a sexual way.Unfortunately, things would take a wrong turn for Johnson back at the dairy – a sentence I might once have found mildly unusual, before I realised that Johnson’s workwear adviser for this election was probably going to get a CBE in the new year honours. This week alone, Johnson has dressed up as a fisherman, a digger driver, a milkman, a builder and a baker. How old is his election strategist? I assume they say basgetti instead of spaghetti, and still wear pull-up nappies at night. Yet despite the relish with which Johnson embraces cosplaying as a working man, he always seems oversized and grotesquely out of place in these scenes, as though a vast unlicensed buttock implant has just been cast in Camberwick Green.Anyway: the fridge. Back at the Modern Milkman HQ, a producer for Good Morning Britain, filming live, asked whether the programme could get a chat with the prime minister. “For fuck’s sake!” said a senior Conservative source called Rob Oxley, still live on air. At which point the prime minister scuttled into a large fridge.Time for a historical perspective, perhaps: despite having an underground bedroom as part of the war rooms complex, Boris Johnson’s hero Winston Churchill declined to sleep in it any more than four or five times in the entire second world war, including during the blitz when London was under sustained nightly bombardment. Without wishing to go out on a limb, then, it is difficult to imagine Winston Churchill fleeing a lone Pathé news camera to conceal himself inside a refrigerator. Johnson’s move forces an urgent reordering of the top three most embarrassing places British politicians have hidden because they couldn’t handle the consequences of their actions. This now goes: 3. Edinburgh pub – Nigel Farage. 2. Disabled loo – Ken Livingstone 1. Fridge – Boris Johnson.Because the smallness of the man could not be conceded, Tory campaign staff attempted to insist the interview request and the prime minister’s presence in a fridge were correlated but not causal. According to the ’s deadpan report on the matter, Conservative sources – I don’t know which ones, but “for fuck’s sake” let’s have a guess – claimed that Johnson was “categorically not hiding” in the fridge, from which he later emerged carrying a crate of milk bottles. Instead, they fucksaked, his aides were taking a moment to prep the PM for a separate, pre-agreed interview.Spellbinding. They honestly would have been better off going with something along the lines of: “As you could see from the fact he’d rather steal a phone than empathise with the picture of a sick child, the prime minister is an extremely cold man. We had word from the dairy manager that one of the units was nudging over 4 degrees and the whole batch would have to be scrapped, so we whisked the prime minister in there to lower the temperature. Hey presto – milk lollies for all. The guy’s like Elsa or something. Let’s get Brexit done and sign an ambitious trade deal with Arendelle.”For their part, for this final day, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour wanted to talk about the NHS crisis. Not sure what the costume is for that – perhaps a grim reaper’s cowl, although that would make Corbyn look like he was playing Ben Kenobi in a panto version of Star Wars. Inevitably, though, the Labour leader couldn’t help talking about the fridge. “I’ve not come here to deliver milk,” Corbyn informed a rally in Middlesbrough, “or to hide in a fridge.”Yet hilariously – and indeed malarially – the Labour party then issued a formal statement featuring the following sentence about Boris Johnson: “He is hiding in fridges to dodge interviews precisely because his fake Brexit slogans can’t stand up to scrutiny.” Oh man. Who knows whether in retrospect this will look like the moment Labour were finally defeated by Johnson’s WTF-ery? But I can’t help but notice Her Majesty’s opposition have just immediately normalised the idea of hiding in fridges as a political act, suggesting that it’s something logical a prime minister might do “precisely because” of something else, as opposed to what it is: a prime minister, of an actual country, hiding in a fridge. Guys, you can’t fit this into the old attack templates. You’re fighting a war against a fridge-hider. There aren’t any established conventions. This is frontierland – we passed the rules five fucksakes ago.And what of Britain’s next prime minister, Jo Swinson? Alas, even she was unable to dodge the fridge-iverse. I kept seeing her supporters say versions of “You know what? She’s turned up to every TV interview and debate. She’s never hidden in a fridge.” So let the record show there’s a new benchmark. Here we are. This, then, is us. On the eve of polling day for the general election of 2019, the fridge is now the black hole of UK politics. None of us can escape its event horizon, so I can’t say “see you on the other side”. In totally scientific terms, there is no other side to see you on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e28721fe3e809c2440fc0152cc697c345c2b77/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6fe6f808c2273703e148ac8c5fd4958","title":"election opinion polls uk 2019 latest poll tracker tories labour","story":"Find out who’s ahead in the polls on the campaign’s final day.

But the latest finding is exceptional as it is more than twice as old as any previously known narrative scenes and hints at ancient myths and an early capacity for imagination.“It suggested to us that this extraordinary scene suggests a story or some kind of myth,” said Brumm.The 4.5-metre-wide panel shows six fleeing mammals – two Sulawesi warty pigs and four dwarf buffaloes, known as anoas, small but fierce animals that still inhabit the island’s dwindling forests. The animals are being pursued by human-like figures with some animal features (academics call these therianthropes), who seem to be wielding long swords or ropes. Their bodies are human-shaped but one appears to have the head of a bird and another has a tail.Human-animal hybrids occur in the folklore of almost every modern society and are frequently cast as gods, spirits or ancestral beings in religions across the world.“The most fascinating aspect is it has all the key elements of modern human cognition,” said Prof Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist at Australia’s Griffith University. “Hand stencils, a narrative scene, human-like figures that were conceived of something that doesn’t really exist in the real world. Everything is there by 44,000 years ago.”The cave is in a well-explored system, which researchers had visited frequently over the past decade. The discovery was made after an expedition member noticed what appeared to be an entrance to a high level chamber above and climbed up a fig tree to investigate. “And then, bang, there’s this incredible new rock art site in there that’s essentially like nothing we’ve ever seen before in this entire region,” said Brumm.Rock art is difficult to date, and the scientists relied on analysing mineral growths known as cave popcorn, that had formed over the painting. Measuring the radioactive decay of uranium and other elements in the deposits gave dates ranging from 35,100 to 43,900 years as a minimum age for the Sulawesi discovery. The findings are described in the journal Nature.“It’s just amazing and to me it just shows how much more rock art that is out there waiting to be discovered that completely changes our understanding of the human story,” said Brumm.Before this latest discovery, the oldest undisputed examples of figurative cave art date to about 35,000 years old. The oldest cave art on record is abstract forms attributed to Neanderthals, which have been dated to 64,000 years old. The art features lines, dots and animal-like shapes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24f3cf32e23c75a9f66c5e4663c19fffd344156/0_69_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f5123e73c7a3ced3903cd3bdd3cf3e6","title":"hendrix hepburn study busts myths about origins of uks parakeets","story":"Researchers find no single hotspot but signs of owners releasing birds in health scaresTheir bright green feathers and unmistakable squawk make ring-necked parakeets a striking addition to British park wildlife, but the question of how the tropical birds were first introduced has been a subject of contention.One urban legend traces their origin to a pair released by Jimi Hendrix on Carnaby Street in 1968 another suggests they arrived in 1951 when Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn visited London with various animals in tow to film The African Queen, set in the equatorial swamps of east Africa.Now the question has been subjected to a rigorous forensic analysis for the first time, in research that points to an entirely different explanation: pet owners around the country releasing the birds into the wild, possibly prompted by media coverage of fatal “parrot fever” outbreaks.Steven Le Comber, who led the research at Queen Mary University London, said: “The ring-necked parakeet has become a successful invasive species in 34 countries on five continents. The fun legends relating to the origins of the UK’s parakeets are probably not going to go away any time soon.”However, analysis by Le Comber and colleagues based on geographic profiling methods used to track down criminals concluded that Britain’s booming parakeet population has grown from numerous small-scale accidental and intentional pet releases.The analysis tested other popular theories, including that parakeets kept at Syon Park in west London escaped in the 1970s when a plane crashed through the aviary roof, or that damage to aviaries during the Great Storm of 1987 was responsible. However, none of the suspect sites showed up prominently in the heatmap of more than 5,000 unique records dating from 1968 to 2018.The research, published in the journal Zoology Letters, drew on sightings recorded in the National Bioersity Network Atlas dating back to the 1960s. When this failed to produce an obvious hotspot of parrot activity, the researchers turned to newspaper archives, and a search turned up thousands of pages of news stories about parakeets written between 1804 and 2008.The team found numerous sensational accounts of human deaths due to so-called parrot fever, an infection called psittacosis, which has the potential to be passed from bird to human and which can be deadly. In 1932 the Middlesex County Times reported that parakeets had been spotted in Epping Forest and credited the “parrot disease scare” of 1931 for an increase in pet birds being released into the wild.A 1952 headline in London’s Daily Herald reported calls to “Stop import of danger parrots”, while a 1974 report in the Reading Evening Post described eight people falling sick after the death of a parrot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff8382b84df7ba9ca7b5dcdbb8aa9b7d85c9036/732_1277_2676_1605/master/2676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937ce58af1d3824a85eb0bb0a72481d2","title":"beauty and the beast review oxford playhouse","story":"Oxford PlayhouseAn empowered Belle leads an energetic cast in this song-packed extravaganza, featuring nifty shadow play, terrifying puppets and infectious 80s classicsWith the general election looming, writer-director Steve Marmion promised to “go lightly on the politics” in his new pantomime. A wise decision, given the fractious national mood. Instead, Marmion’s fifth panto in a row at the Oxford Playhouse turned out to be a song-packed feast of fun, with a tremendously energetic cast cranking the momentum up to a furious pace.In place of topicality, Marmion dribbles a few classics through the show. Some nifty shadow play sets the scene at the beginning of each half, and the Beast – when he appears – is a Gruffalo-style giant puppet on stilts, with a detachable claw that shoots in and out of the early scenes. There’s a clever bit involving the Beast’s flaming red eyes just as the curtain falls for the interval – “mildly terrifying”, according to my nine-year-old.Much more up her street was the way Belle (Roseanna Frascona) was self-assertive and empowered – very much in the modern Disney mode – even suggesting to the prince (Matthew Staite) that she might prefer him in monster form. Brian the Orangutan (Ricky Oakley) and the mayor-turned-fox (Adrianna Bertola) also got the children in the audience on side – especially judging by the pair of kids hauled up on stage for a little friendly melon racing. Philip Pellew’s teapot-shaped Dame had the youngsters giggling, and gothic sorceress Witch Kardashia (Dev Joshi) induced a shock or two in the little ’uns.Best of all, perhaps, was the infectious song and dance that formed the bulk of the show: 80s classics such as Toto’s Africa and Katrina and the Waves’s Walking on Sunshine did a lot of the work, but the presence of Iggy Pop was a bit of a leftfield surprise.

Then her brutal death – in chains – caused outrage. The star talks about the highs and lows of GoT – and feeling liberated by the Four Weddings remakeNathalie Emmanuel arrives mildly flustered. There’s been a last minute change of plans and, as we walk, she talks about a disappointing meal she had the night before at one of her favourite vegan restaurants. As she sits down in a London cafe with a matcha almond latte, I wonder if this could this be the start of a showbiz rant. But it soon becomes obvious that that isn’t Emmanuel’s style. Despite spending much of the past decade in what many consider the greatest TV series ever, Game of Thrones, she’s warm and unpretentious, quickly telling me she picked up her fancy, gled jumper at a discount sale.Emmanuel first blazed into the show’s blood-soaked, power-crazed, meteorologically challenged universe in season three, playing Missandei, who is freed from slavery by Daenerys, the Dragon Queen. She becomes Daenerys’s unwaveringly loyal and ridiculously capable handmaiden: she speaks 19 languages, which is impressive, even if they are all made up. The two characters swiftly become close, so close that Emmanuel once felt obliged to deny that the pair were going to end up in bed. Unlike pretty much every other character in GoT, Missandei made it to season eight, the final one, sparking up a romance with eunuch warrior Grey Worm along the way – before her eventual beheading in chains, which caused a storm, given she was the show’s only long-running woman of colour.In a rather different vein, her latest project is the US miniseries Four Weddings and a Funeral, from showrunner Mindy Kaling of The Office and The Mindy Project fame. Set in London and based on Richard Curtis’s romcom bumblefest, the show is, says Emmanuel, “a breath of fresh air”. Its Notting Hill palaces are slightly different from where she grew up, by the sea in Southend, Essex. Born to mixed-race parents of Dominican and St Lucian heritage, Emmanuel had by the age of 10 broken out of the local am-dram scene and was already performing in The Lion King in London’s West End. By 17, she was in teatime staple Hollyoaks, moving to Liverpool to take up the role, being snapped on red carpets in the sort of OTT dresses teenage girls now wear to school proms, her curls slicked back with thick gel. There are pap shots of her from then, too, sporting Uggs and heavily flat-ironed hair.It wasn’t just sartorial experiments that were going on. Having been “so protected” by her parents, she was now working six days a week, filing tax returns and playing a heroin-addicted character, Sasha. She recalls one particularly stressful day on set. “I came into work and somebody was really unwell, so we shot a different scene. It was when my mum died in the show. I was like, ‘Hang on a minute!’ I had to bring out performances I hadn’t had time to really get into.” The soap world was stressful but formative, leaving Emmanuel with nothing but respect for their stars. “Anyone who says anything about soap stars can suck it as far as I’m concerned!” she says.When she left in 2010, Emmanuel’s career pretty much ground to a halt, leading to a stint on the shopfloor at preppy clothing chain Hollister. She can’t stand seeing other actors chided for having such “normal” jobs, as happened this year when the former Eastenders actor Katie Jarvis was ridiculed on social media for working as a security guard.“If you’re privileged enough to be born into a family who can financially support your creative dreams, that’s amazing,” she says. “But not everybody has that. And to shame people for wanting to support themselves – she’s just being a mum and a good one.”Emmanuel has a strong social conscience, praising her own mum (a carer for adults with learning disabilities) and her sister (a primary school teacher) for working to remedy “the day to day struggles of people”. A few days after our interview, she appears in a video for Operation Black Vote, alongside fellow actor Will Poulter and the journalist Ash Sarkar.All the time she was at Hollister, Emmanuel pressed her agent to put her forward for GoT, her favourite show. When the role of Missandei came up, she prepared extensively, learning the Valyrian language and mastering various accents. After five weeks, she found out she had got the part, bursting into tears on the phone. “I really loved Missandei’s journey,” she says rapturously. “In the grand scheme of the show, Missandei and Grey Worm didn’t have a lot of time, but we had some lovely scenes. I also loved my relationship with Emilia Clarke as Daenerys – that female friendship and respect for each other. It was such a joy to do.”Emmanuel’s brow furrows, however, as she guesses the next question. Missandei’s death angered many fans and critics when it aired in May. US culture site Vulture said Missandei “dies as a pawn rather than a person”. Director Ava DuVernay tweeted her dismay: “So ... the one and only sister on the whole epic, years-long series? That’s what you wanna do? Okay.” Writer Mikki Kendall added that Missandei “died in chains with no way to defend herself. Lyanna slays a giant. Missandei should have too.” Even before her death, Vanity Fair commented that the treatment of both her character and Grey Worm, played by Jacob Anderson, “reeks of years of aggregated missed opportunity”.Emmanuel says: “Obviously, Missandei’s demise sparked a big conversation.” Before then, she says, “the show was criticised for its lack of ersity. Jacob and I often had to answer for that, as the two prominent characters of colour in the show, which was really difficult.” She pauses, keen to emphasise the agency she felt Missandei had, and the triumph of her final war cry, before returning to the limitations of her death.“The reaction to Missandei’s death was so big because she was the only one. I think a lot of the people who felt othered or disenfranchised had connected with her, or felt represented by her, especially women of colour. When she died – and in the way that she did – it was so painful for people because they were like, ‘Wait, no! That’s how they’re going to do the only woman of colour?’”Emmanuel never thought she and Grey Worm would sail off into the sunset to Naath. “That’s not Game of Thrones.” But she does want other shows to learn from the situation – and not sentence her to yet more “overwhelming pressure” to constantly discuss ersity, or its absence.Thankfully, Four Weddings promises to be different, not least because Kaling, a woman of colour, is at the helm. Emmanuel plays Maya, a political speechwriter who travels from the US to London for her best friend’s birthday, soon discovering that – by coincidence – the handsome chap called Kash she bumped into at Heathrow is her friend’s boyfriend. He’s played by Nikesh Patel, star of Indian Summers. The romantic dilemma that ensues is one of many to unfold over 10 episodes.Romcoms, says Emmanuel, “have never been particularly welcoming of ersity. So the fact that we had Kash and Maya – a British Pakistani Muslim man and an African American woman – at the centre of the story is very rare. The fact that it was even on the table was a breath of fresh air.” She is pleased they have been able to revisit Curtis’s “quintessentially British” films in a fresh way. “The truth is that those films did not represent the London that we live in – and we got to do that.”Besides, Four Weddings has been a change from all the bloody struggles of Westeros. “It’s a lot of fun – it’s light, it’s not that serious. There are a lot of shows these days that are so dark and violent and we love their drama, but this is about millennials and their love lives. And no one gets their head cut off.”• Four Weddings and a Funeral airs on Starzplay in the UK from 12 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b8164a953ae6f0d71008ecb97fefdbd8b5ec56/0_0_4266_2560/master/4266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb35aa663922c36b90d367392e146320","title":"the x factor the band review simon cowell tragic bid to revive a dying show","story":"With this twist, Simon Cowell clearly thought he could breathe new life into a cursed franchise on its last legs. Well ... it’s a big no from me!Strictly Come Dancing has managed to maintain its status as a national institution for 15 years, while its old rival The X Factor, which also started in 2004, has seen its cultural dominance slowly slip away. There are countless reasons for its decline. The pop industry is always shifting and the old gatekeepers have far less clout than they once did. A hit can happen whether they want it to or not, just as a career can tank, no matter how much is thrown at it. (Try to name the last three X Factor winners.)It is understandable, then, that Simon Cowell can’t resist tinkering with the format. But endless nips-and-tucks have left it worse off. The X Factor: Celebrity managed to sour even the usual winning formula of taking something popular and adding famous people. An All Stars version (bringing back former contestants to compete again) has been pushed back indefinitely. Now The X Factor: The Band (ITV) looks set to continue this cursed run. Presumably, Cowell was hoping to breathe new life into the franchise instead, he appears to be keeping it on life support against doctors’ best advice.The Band has been rushed out. Spanning four episodes across one week, it feels like a peculiar addition to the format, rather than a genuine contender for what it might do next if it has any chance of survival. The concept is that Cowell and guests audition singers, then form two bands – a boy band and a girl band – who compete in a live final on Sunday. If it sounds familiar, that is because it is an expedited Pop Stars: The Rivals, best known for bringing us Girls Aloud and One True Voice (RIP) in 2002.At the start of the first episode on Monday, Cowell announced he had “never done it quite under this pressure before”. But the pressure is of his own making: he has admitted that he brought the show forward because Little Mix, who came up through The X Factor, are doing their own band-based talent show on BBC One next year and he wanted to sneak in ahead of it. Perhaps that is good business sense perhaps it is the unedifying spectacle of a powerful man pulling rank on the women he helped to make famous. You decide.On Monday, Cowell proclaimed he is looking for singers with “a sense of humour, personality, ambition ... rather than puppets”, which is a bit like Rod Hull telling Emu he is over the whole hand-up-bum thing. The auditions suggested an artisanal X Factor – hand-crafted, back to basics, the equivalent of those rootsy “independent” coffee shops filled with wonky furniture that turn out to be owned by a supermarket.The process was stark and simple. Singers arrived at Syco HQ to sing in Cowell’s office, a giant portrait of his face looming in the background. Songwriters and producers from the Syco machine sat on the sidelines, a mini-audience, namedropping stars such as “Ri” who have performed their songs. If the contestant got the promising “home and family” preamble, they didn’t have a TV crew visit their house, but rather filmed it themselves on their smartphones. That is more in keeping with the social media content you might expect from teenagers, but it looked budget and dashed off. “I usually can tell within the first couple of seconds if someone has ‘it’ or not,” said guest judge Nicole Scherzinger, sagely. Perhaps that is why the series is only four episodes long.Tellingly, you could play a drinking game based on the amount of times someone mentioned One Direction – and you would be drunk enough not to notice just how much has changed since 2004. It felt appropriately weird to watch Cowell criticise a teenage girl for her “image” (what she has chosen to wear). Most noticeably, the nos were less frequent, and far less brutal than they used to be. The starting point for almost everyone on the show is good, and the feedback lacked the excoriating meanness that used to be par for the course. That is progress of sorts, I suppose.On Wednesday, the girls faced off on Friday, the boys will do the same. By Sunday, we will have the head to head that would usually come as the culmination of weeks’ worth of building up a fanbase for acts that have earned it. Can it be rushed? Cowell must be wondering. The ratings on Monday were not promising. But it is hard to get excited by a return to something we have seen so many times before. It is clear that there are talented singers and songwriters here, but it is no longer enough to watch them go through a tired process in the hope that they will get noticed, particularly when we know this isn’t the star-making machine it once was. The X Factor: The Band is not bad, not terrible, but it is only fine – and, in 2019, that means it has to be a no from me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8efbc520ac10c584a8e8132ef569ea21c124a56/254_386_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beabfd2ad2f02431aeca2460ccddf63e","title":"the country faces a bright future finland readers on their new pm","story":"We asked readers in Finland to share their thoughts on the country’s new prime minister.

Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn’t hesitate to say her opinion. I’m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I’m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, FinlandShe seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damskägg, 28, student, HelsinkiI first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland’s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, TampereI’m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she’s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyväskylä, FinlandIt’s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We’ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin’s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both ‘normal jobs’ as well as politics are being questioned and I’m quite sure this wouldn’t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I’m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance.

But the arguments advanced by Aung San Suu Kyi at The Hague in response to allegations including genocide were much the same as the Burmese leader has been making for years. Most had been discredited long before she delivered her 20-minute address at the international court of justice on Wednesday morning.There had undoubtedly been violence in the country’s restive northern Rakhine state, Aung San Suu Kyi told the judges. Armed groups had attacked the Burmese army, which had responded with force, sending more than 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. But she challenged the idea that the military’s actions were carried out with genocidal intent – “to destroy the Rohingya as a group, in whole or in part”.She cited Myanmar’s efforts to investigate the alleged crimes. Soldiers had been jailed and an extensive special inquiry was under way, she said. In addition, Myanmar has been negotiating with Bangladesh’s government for the “voluntary, safe and dignified” return of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled to Cox’s Bazar starting in August 2017.“How can there be an ongoing genocide or genocidal intent when these concrete steps are being taken?” she asked.Yet far from absolving the country, each of these steps has been sharply criticised as delaying justice, at best, and denying it at worst.Seven Burmese military personnel were indeed sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labour after being found guilty of murdering 10 Muslim men. But they were released after serving less than a year behind bars. (In contrast, two Reuters journalists who exposed the killings were jailed for more than 500 days.)It is also true that a special investigation has been established. Myanmar announced an international commission of enquiry (ICOE) in May 2018. But the rule of law in the country is notoriously patchy, and the independence of the judiciary has been in question for decades.The Myanmar government explicitly said it was establishing the ICOE in response to “false allegations” of violence against the Rohingya. At a press conference in August 2018, the commission’s chair made clear “there will be no blaming of anybody, no finger-pointing of anybody”.Organisations such as the International Commission for Jurists have concluded the ICOE “cannot reasonably be seen as having any chance of being independent, impartial or making an effective contribution to justice or accountability for the crimes under international law”. A UN investigation has said the same.Aung San Suu Kyi said the ICOE had conducted the most extensive investigation of any group into the events in Rakhine state. That may be correct, but only because her government continues to deny access to Rakhine to any other investigators.She was also correct when she said her government had been negotiating with Bangladesh for the voluntary, dignified and safe return of Rohingya refugees from their dire encampments in Cox’s Bazar. But so far, only a handful of people have returned, precisely because Rohingya leaders do not yet believe they can go back to Myanmar safely or with dignity – still lacking full citizenship, the rights to study, work and travel, and without reparations for the property stolen from them.Among the signs of progress in Rakhine state Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to was that camps of internally displaced people, including the Rohingya, were being closed and their residents moved to permanent housing. But conditions in these new settlements are so restrictive that the UN in June declared it would start to restrict its funding for the closure process, fearing the international community was helping to entrench a “policy of apartheid” in Myanmar.Aung San Suu Kyi sought to put the violence in Rakhine state in the context of fighting between the Burmese military and armed militia groups such as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. If civilians were being harmed, she said, it was not part of a genocide but a desperate civil war.“Please bear in mind this complex situation and the challenge to sovereignty and security in our country when you are assessing the intent of those who attempted to deal with the rebellion,” Aung San Suu Kyi told the judges. “Surely, under the circumstances, genocidal intent cannot be the only hypothesis.”Except the violence against the Rohingya did not commence in October 2016, when militant groups staged attacks on the Burmese army, drawing a brutal response. The Rohingya have been marginalised for decades in Myanmar: slurred as invading “Bengalis” from the north, banned from leaving their villages without permission, unable to attend universities and restricted in accessing health and education services. Even their ethnic status as Rohingya people is not recognised by the Myanmar government.Of this ongoing, systematic discrimination – and whether it rises to the level of genocide – Aung San Suu Kyi had nothing to say. The judges will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b20368041b4b7ea40b46a6ca6c7fa422bd636ccd/0_193_5040_3023/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016071b62e9d2d9a81aa330470c53c0c","title":"israel heads for unprecedented third election in a year as stalemate continues","story":"Israel’s parliament votes on Wednesday to dissolve itself in a fresh bid to break political deadlockIsrael is set to hold a third round of elections within 12 months, after a deadline to form a government passed with no politician able to bring together the disparate parties.A time limit to forge a majority coalition in the country’s parliament, the Knesset, expired at midnight on Wednesday, automatically triggering a fresh national ballot.By law, the poll cannot be held for three months, extending a political deadlock that has paralysed the country deep into next year. Lawmakers were debating late into the night on holding the vote on 2 March.Israel has been gripped by political paralysis for the best part of a year after two inconclusive votes gave neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor his rival, Benny Gantz, a clear lead.Both men have attempted to cobble together a 61-seat majority, while also stalling each other’s plays for power. A final 21-day period in which any parliamentarian could be nominated as prime minister also ended with no frontrunner.The development is seen as a boon for Netanyahu who had feared a last-minute deal by the opposition would end his decade-long run in power.However, under indictment in three substantial corruption cases and facing a small but vocal party mutiny, the leader of the right-wing Likud party immediately enters a new battle. The looming charges have weakened Israel’s longest-serving leader, and he will likely have to face a party leadership primary on 26 December.He is largely expected to win, although recent polling suggests his popularity may have taken a hit for the forthcoming national election.The political stalemate has played out during a fraught time for Israel. While politicians have bickered and traded blame, the country has fought on-off fights with militants in Gaza. Meanwhile, an increasingly open conflict heats up with Iran, Israel’s arch-enemy and a regional powerhouse.One option to end the domestic crisis was for the two main parties to join together in a unity government, as they would have more than enough support for a 61-seat majority. But there have been vast differences between the rivals during negotiations on key aspects such as how the next administration will look, including who leads it.Gantz ran his election campaign on the promise to topple Netanyahu, making it difficult for the opposition leader to accept a power-sharing deal without losing credibility.The prime minister has insisted his traditional allies from hardline nationalists to religious parties be included in any unity government, a precondition Gantz has rejected.Netanyahu was also reported to have demanded he serve first under any rotation agreement with Gantz, as he would want to remain in office as the court cases start rolling. If he retains the role of prime minister, he is not legally-obliged to step down from public office and could use his position to push for immunity. Netanyahu has denied all allegations as a “witch-hunt”.Fresh elections are expected to cost hundreds of millions of pounds and many fear bitter campaigns seen in the previous two rounds will further ide the country. Netanyahu was widely accused of racist scaremongering focused on Israel’s Arab minority to rally support.“Keep your children away from the television,” said Yair Lapid, a senior member of Blue and White, saying the campaign will be a “festival of hate, violence and disgust”.“What used to be a celebration of democracy has become a moment of shame for this building,” he added. “There are only three reasons for this election — bribery, fraud and breach of trust,” he said, referring to the criminal charges filed against Netanyahu.Netanyahu did not attend Wednesday night’s vote. In a video on social media, he accused Gantz of conspiring with Arab leaders and “forcing” new elections. “In order to prevent this happening again, there is only one thing we must do: win and win big,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Oireachtas committee chairman sends requests as Deloitte defends \u0026lsquorobust\u0026rsquo auditingAreas of NRBU concern include Palmerstown, Sandymount, Clondalkin and TyrrelstownTeams of passionate volunteers are putting together an overview of how our birds are faringReport finds a third of drug poisoning deaths in 2017 involved alcoholDon\u0026rsquot wash it, don\u0026rsquot leave it out overnight and \u0026ndash best of all \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot eat leftovers after three daysGovernment criticised for failure to build enough refuges to meet demandTD told to \u0026lsquostop your nonsense and stick to the facts\u0026rsquoMary Robinson wanted to reassure young people \u0026lsquothey have made their voice heard\u0026rsquoMan arrested in Dublin released without chargeFormer employee says he has not worked since attempting to lift 20kg bag in 2014Alliance for Insurance Reform responding to paper by Law Reform CommissionGr\u0026aacuteinne Kealy one of 17 acknowledged for their work on road safetyNew mothers being placed into \u0026lsquoone night only\u0026rsquo emergency accommodationWar of Independence dead to be recalled but questions arise over \u0026rsquoBlack and Tans\u0026rsquoIFA president Joe Healy claims retailer\u0026rsquos discounts hurt producers\u0026rsquo incomesBarrister remembered by TDs in debate on Bill to criminalise telling of lies on oathDublin 15 Action Against Gender Violence protest outside Leinster House calling for service to be expandedZappone had been in talks with AG in recent years in an effort to break impasse over BillJoe Kennedy III, Richard Neal and Brendan Boyle send letter on eve of British election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4110645.1575968774!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland has third highest quality of life in world says un report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland has a life expectancy of 82 years.

Photograph:  Dara Mac DonaillThe latest BusConnects proposals while “not perfect” do ensure that most areas have access to “decent” public bus services, the National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU) has said. In a submission to the National Transport Authority (NTA), seen by The , the union notes that many direct services have been restored under the new plans but there remain a “number of contentious locations that are not best served”. The areas of concern listed by the NBRU include Palmerstown, Sandymount, Clondalkin, Tyrrelstown, Bray and Kinsealy. “The changes that have been made reflect the huge levels of anger that existed when the first-phase plan was mooted and that was reflective in the large attendances at vast numbers of public meetings arranged by politicians of all hues,” the union’s submission states. “The phase-two proposals, while not perfect, do ensure that most areas have access to decent public bus service.”BusConnects aims to overhaul the bus system in the Dublin region by creating 230km of dedicated bus lanes and 200km of cycle tracks along 16 of the busiest corridors and a redesign of the network.Faster journey timesThe NTA says the plans promise faster journey times and a high-frequency service on busy routes and an easy-to-understand network.In July last year, the authority published a redesign of the bus network and almost 50,000 submissions were made as part of a public consultation process. Under the original plans up to 15 per cent of users would have lost their direct routes to the city, but this was reduced to 5 per cent in the latest proposals, published in October. Public consultation in relation to the updated plans closed on Tuesday. The new bus network is due to be implemented over a phased basis between 2021 and 2023.In its submission, the NBRU said it wanted “resilience” in the bus network to cater for spikes in demand, and “to that end we are of the opinion that the frequency of the new direct services should have a baseline all day frequency of at least every 20 minutes”.The union says “a main worry” is car-parking facilities at new transport hubs. “Although the wish is for everyone to use public transport, a proportion of people will drive to Blanchardstown and other centres,” it said. “We don’t want a situation where private car-park owners profit by fleecing commuters. Park-and-ride facilities should be priced into fares.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4112593.1576100408!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"regulators called in to investigate audits of fai accounts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCommittee members raised concerns that they may not have a chance to question the outgoing president of the FAI, Donal Conway, if the association does not appear before it in advance of his finishing date in January. Photograph: Ryan ByrneInphoThe chairman of the Oireachtas sport committee has written to accountancy and auditing regulators asking them to investigate the audits of the Football Association of Ireland’s (FAI) accounts.Chairman Fergus O’Dowd took the step after the committee decided in private session on Wednesday that it did not have the remit to call the auditors of the association, Deloitte, before it.Mr O’Dowd told The  that he was taking the step due to the emergence of a €55 million liability in the accounts of the FAI, which was arrived at following a re-examination and restating of financial results for 2016 and 2017, and the publication of 2018 accounts.In a letter to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), seen by The , Mr O’Dowd said he noted “with great concern” that recent surpluses had been dramatically reduced in restated accounts. In 2017, a surplus of €2.8 million had become a loss of €2.9 million. For 2018, the FAI made a loss of almost €9 million.“Can I ask that your authority, as the Irish Accounting Supervisory Authority, will investigate as a matter of urgency all aspects of these audits by Deloitte,” he wrote. A similar letter will be sent to the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board (Carb).It came after the FAI declined an invitation to appear in front of the committee on Wednesday, despite first indicating that it would answer members’ questions about its finances. The committee is set to invite the FAI back in front of it next Wednesday, and if that date doesn’t suit, it will offer a standing invite to the organisation to appear whenever it can be arranged.Committee members raised concerns that they may not have a chance to question the outgoing president of the FAI, Donal Conway, if the association does not appear before it in advance of his finishing date in January.‘Answers’Noel Rock, the Fine Gael TD for Dublin North-West, said “it is quite clear the whole country, myself included, want answers. Mr Conway is in a position to answer them. The committee are prepared to meet the FAI at any time, day or night, to get those answers into the public domain.”Mr Conway served on the board of the FAI during almost the entire tenure of former chief executive John Delaney, and was on the board when his controversial pay deal, including generous loyalty and pension payments, was signed off. He said last week he was guilty of a “sin of omission” in relation to certain aspects of corporate governance failings by the board.Committee member Catherine Murphy said she believed all the directors who served on the board during Mr Delaney’s tenure should step down. “By virtue of the fact that some directors were part of the old board, it’s not giving the new directors a fair chance.”Elsewhere, a committee plan to simultaneously question the FAI and Minister for Sport Shane Ross next Wednesday has been abandoned after Mr Ross made it known that he would not be willing to appear before the committee at the same time as the association."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4112424.1576089562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bit of breathing space from brexit at eu summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t European Council president Charles Michel: wants to send a signal to the final sessions of the COP25 climate summit in Madrid of  EU willingness to provide global leadership on climate change. Photograph: Johanna GeronBanquo, the celebrated “ghost at the feast” whose presence cast a pall of bad memories on the assembled guests, was at least at the feast.Boris Johnson, whose bumbling spirit will haunt EU leaders when they gather on Thursday, is not turning up. He has electoral\u0026nbspbusiness elsewhere, and will be represented by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel.For the first time in years Brexit will not dominate the agenda of a European Council, although the leaders will return to the issue briefly on Friday morning. Not, we are told, to discuss the implications of the overnight election count, but to say, as Michel put it on Wednesday, “we are ready for the next steps” and to endorse a continuing role for Michel Barnier in future-relationship talks that must start almost immediately after the UK leaves the EU on January 31st.That, anyway, is the working assumption – that Johnson will win with a sufficient majority to pass the withdrawal agreement and take the UK out into transition.Johnson’s infuriating ghost, however, is the expression of that niggling doubt that maybe all will not turn out as expected and that a majority is not assured. But there is here an unspoken sense, a heresy that dare not be spoken, that although no one wants the Brits to leave, it is now, in said ghost’s immortal words, time to “get Brexit done”.\u0026nbspThere is no illusion, however, that the difficulties will end here. In a discussion of the leaders’ “conclusions”, ambassadors removed a reference in the agreed text exhorting the union negotiators to move quickly to try and meet Johnson’s wild expectation that talks can be completed successfully by the end of 2020.No chance, all understand. And the British PM’s repeated assertion that he will not ask for another extension by the treaty’s specification of the end of June fills many with the sense that we are again heading for a no-deal cliff edge, this time without a prospect of escape.Target and roadmapThe agenda proper of the summit will be dominated by two other issues – responding to climate change, and the not-unrelated EU budget (multiannual financial framework or MFF) talks .Michel wants to be able to send a signal to the final sessions of the COP25 climate summit in Madrid of an EU willingness to provide global leadership on dealing with climate change with a solemn commitment by the union to carbon-neutrality by 2050. That target and a roadmap to get there were set out in the commission’s Green New Deal published on Wednesday.But the commitment to 2050 is being held up by three member states – Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic – who argue that their dependence on fossil fuels makes the challenge particularly onerous for them.They say that they will not agree to 2050 unless they get “new” money in a “just transition mechanism” to help states with particular problems. The mechanism is acceptable in principle to the other states but no one will talk yet about funding.Agreement appears difficult, even to the conclusions’ wording that “endorses the objective of achieving” the 2050 target without committing anyone. “That is extremely ambitious for some,” one senior EU official said. “We can’t have more than that on language.”Transition mechanismThe problem is that funding issues are matters for the MFF discussion and are currently so far from specifics that even a hint at how the transition mechanism will be funded is out of the question. The commission has spoken of €100 billion but that is little more than an aspiration.The MFF debate will happen over dinner on Thursday night and no one is expecting any more than a restatement by leaders of their respective positions. The issue is now taken on board by Michel, whose team have let it be known that they expect to convene a special new summit in February to finalise an agreement. The best that could be said, one senior official said, is that “we are at the end of the beginning” of the process.The Finns have attempted to put figures on the broad outlines of a deal which is significantly less ambitious in spending terms than the commission’s original proposals. Few have been kind about it, although on Wednesday both Dutch and Irish sources were willing to venture that the “negotiating box” “has some merits”.The leaders will also agree conclusions on the establishment from next year of a conference on the future of Europe. Some member states, like Ireland, approve in principle but are adamant it must not lead to treaty changes or an intergovernmental conference.Some scepticism over the project, a particular favourite of the European Parliament, was reflected in a senior official’s blunt insistence that the central thrust of the EU’s work programme had to remain its strategic agenda, of which climate change is a central part. A senior diplomat echoed the point. The conference “must not monopolise the bandwidth”, he warned.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Justin LaneEPAMore than 30 women who were allegedly subjected to sexual misconduct by the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein have reportedly reached a $25 million (€22 million) settlement which, if approved, would bring to an end most of the civil lawsuits pending against him. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a tentative deal had been agreed involving Weinstein’s numerous alleged victims in the US, Canada, Britain and Ireland. The proposal is awaiting final approval from the courts and from iniduals involved, the newspaper says, but once those last hurdles are cleared payouts would be made by insurance companies handling the bankruptcy of the Weinstein Company. Weinstein himself would not have to pay a penny to his accusers or have to admit wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, the Times reports. The lack of personal accountability for the former movie producer has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved, though parties to the negotiations insist that the legal options open to them were limited. “I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him. I don’t know what I can really do,” the actor Katherine Kendall, who was allegedly sexually harassed by Weinstein in 1993, told the paper. The pending settlement in the multiple civil lawsuits is by no means the end of Weinstein’s legal woes.Criminal charges On January 6th, his criminal trial is scheduled to open with jury selection in a Manhattan court. The criminal charges against him include the alleged rape of a woman in 2013 and an accusation of forced oral sex on a similarly unnamed woman in 2006. Weinstein has denied any claim of non-consensual sex, criminal or civil. In August Weinstein was also charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault to allow a third woman, the actor Annabella Sciorra, to testify about an alleged rape in 1993. Though the statute of limitations has passed in that incident, prosecutors hope her testimony will demonstrate a pattern of behaviour on the part of the defendant that will help secure his conviction. Weinstein has been free on bail since his arrest in May 2018. On Wednesday his bail conditions were raised from $1 million (€898,000) to $5 million (€4.4 million) after the prosecution accused him of tampering with his electronic ankle monitor. Lawyers for Weinstein, who arrived at court on Wednesday walking with the use of a frame, had claimed the irregular handling of the bracelet was innocently caused by “technical glitches”. The pending settlement in the civil lawsuits was revealed by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the two New York Times reporters who first broke the news of #MeToo sparkWeinstein’s long history of alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, sparking the #MeToo movement. The reporters went on to be awarded a Pulitzer prize and to write a bestselling book on the subject, She Said. Aspects of the tentative deal will probably be contentious and have already prompted angry responses from some of Weinstein’s alleged victims. In particular, more than $12 million (€10 million) out of a total $47 million (€42 million) package to close the Weinstein Company’s affairs would feed back to Weinstein himself along with his brother, Bob, and other board members to contribute to legal costs. According to the Times, two women involved in civil suits against the former producer, Alexandra Canosa and Wedil David, have refused to join the settlement and are challenging it. In a statement, Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for David, said: “We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims. It is shameful that $12 million of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein.” He added: “We plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do.” –  "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Plaid Cymru manifesto 2019: key policies, at a glanceBrexit Party manifesto 2019: key policies, at a glanceGreen Party manifesto 2019: key policies, at a glanceLib Dem manifesto 2019: key policies, at a glanceLabour Party manifesto 2019: key election policies, at a glanceSitting around at Christmas could damage your health for lifeConservative Party manifesto 2019: key election promises, at a glanceHow will today\u0026#39s general election affect Brexit?Manifesto watch: the key policies from each party\u0026#39s 2019 election campaignA guide to tactical voting in tomorrow\u0026#39s election: try our tool for the realist viewWho should I vote for in the 2019 general election?

They looked at a wide variety of different worlds, from relatively small mini-Neptunes only 10 times bigger than our Earth to super-Jupiters that are as big as 600 of our own planet, and from places that are between\u0026nbsp20C\u0026nbspand 2000C.They found that water was common across many of those exoplanets. But they also discovered that there was less of it on those planets than expected, and there was great variety between the different kinds of worlds.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberWe are seeing the first signs of chemical patterns in extra-terrestrial worlds, and we\u0027re seeing just how erse they can be in terms of their chemical compositions, said project leader Dr\u0026nbspNikku\u0026nbspMadhusudhan\u0026nbspfrom the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge.In our solar system, there is much more carbon relative to hydrogen in the atmospheres of the giant planets than there is in the Sun. That is thought to have come about at the formation of the planets, when large amounts of ice and other particles were pulled into the planet.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien lifeResearchers think that there will be a similar situation on other giant exoplanets. If that is true, there should also be large amounts of water.Using data from a huge array of different telescopes, both in space and on the ground, the researchers found that water vapour was present in 14 of th 19 planets, and that there was also an\u0026nbspabundance of sodium and potassium in six planets.But they also found that there was less oxygen relative to other elements, and that they might have formed without gathering significant amounts of ice.It is incredible to see such low water abundances in the atmospheres of a broad range of planets orbiting a variety of stars, said Dr Madhusudhan.The new data gives us a detailed understanding of exoplanets that we don\u0027t even have of our nearest neighbours, scientists said.Measuring the abundances of these chemicals in exoplanetary atmospheres is something extraordinary, considering that we have not been able to do the same for giant planets in our solar system yet, including Jupiter, our nearest gas giant neighbour, said Luis\u0026nbspWelbanks, lead author of the study and\u0026nbspPhD\u0026nbspstudent at the Institute of Astronomy.The discovery changes our understanding both of the prevalence of water on alien planets but also challenges our understanding of how those distant worlds might have formed.Given that water is a key ingredient to our notion of habitability on Earth, it is important to know how much water can be found in planetary systems beyond our own, said\u0026nbspproject leader Dr\u0026nbspMadhusudhan.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, has also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up quickly and effectively.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further potential environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects and it is trialling methods that do not use solvents.Drax also needs more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

should be going to genuinely zero-carbon energy,” said Ms Ernsting.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said governments and businesses had a very poor record so far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action to remove carbon from the

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career.

On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album.

The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain.

Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Sheeran has claimed a number of records in the past few years. In 2019, he shattered the world record for highest-grossing tour, after his\u0026nbspDivide\u0026nbspconcerts earnt £558 million – overtaking the previous recording set by U2 in 2011.\u0026nbspHis song Shape of You was named biggest song of the decade, with 4.3m combined sales that were tallied from a mix of streams, downloads and physical sales.\u0026nbspAdele, however, managed to scoop the biggest albums of the decade – her studio records\u0026nbsp21\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp25\u0026nbsptopped the list, while Sheeran\u0027s\u0026nbspX\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDivide\u0026nbspwere at numbers three and four, respectively.

A decade ago, life expectancy was growing 6.5 times faster for males and 8.2 times faster for females.​When compared with the time period between 2009 to 2011, healthy life expectancy increased by as much as 10 per cent in some areas, while dropping as sharply as 6 per cent in others.Poorest dying nearly 10 years younger than rich, study showsMost advantaged boys in UK expected to outlive poorest by a decadeLife expectancy in UK falls amid rise in avoidable deaths, says reportJo Bibby, director of health at the Health Foundation, said the new ONS statistics were a “stark reminder” that people cannot take the improvements we have come to expect in our health over the past century for granted.She added: “Life expectancy improvements continue to be sluggish, but worryingly healthy life expectancy isn’t keeping pace. People can now expect to spend more of their life in poor health than at the turn of the decade.\u0026nbsp“Whichever party takes office later this week will need to make the long term investments necessary for people to stay healthy in the first place. This will require a shift in the balance of spending towards services such as early years, youth and public health, as well as housing and social security, so that everyone is able to lead healthier lives.”There were significant decreases in healthy life expectancy for boys in Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington, both falling by approximately 6 per cent. For girls the sharpest drop was seen in Croydon, at 9 per cent, while Hillingdon, Walsall, Nottingham and Southampton also saw notable falls.Boys born in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Islington had the highest improvement of six years, marking a 10 per cent increase for both areas. Of the eight local areas achieving a significant increase in healthy life expectancy for boys at birth, five were London boroughs.For girls, the London borough of Southwark experienced the largest increase of 12 per cent, while Haringey increased by 11 per cent. Of the six local areas achieving a significant increase in healthy life expectancy for girls at birth, four were London boroughsIt comes after research by academics at the London School of Economics (LSE) revealed last month that life expectancy predictions in the UK had fallen to levels last seen 16 years ago, with widening social inequalities leading to a rise in avoidable deaths in disadvantaged communities.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson stands between a Stop Brexit sign as she attends a general election campaign event at Esher Rugby Club, south west London.

Capital and £60,000 from Davide Serra, whose firm has shares in a US fracking “pioneer”.“These are significant inidual donations, of up to half a million pounds, from hedge funds and financiers with tens of millions invested in businesses that are driving the climate emergency,” Mr Parr said.But a Tory spokesperson said: “The Conservative Party is funded by membership, fundraising and donations.\u0026nbspDonations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.“The Conservatives have reduced emissions by a quarter, part of the fastest reduction by any G20 nation, and boosted renewables to record levels.”In a statement, the Lib Dems pointed to commitments in their manifesto to require all UK-registered companies, and those listed on stock exchanges, to report on climate change targets “consistent with the Paris Agreement”.The party would also regulate financial services to encourage green investments and create new powers for regulators to act if banks and other investors are not managing climate risks properly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be

But it is thought that advice from candidates to vote tactically could produce a potentially decisive shift in votes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCardiff North was taken by Labour’s Anna McMorrin by a margin of eight points in 2017 after being in Tory hands since 2010.Last night’s MRP polling analysis by YouGov suggested that Ms McMorrin was on course to retain the seat, with a 53 per cent vote share putting her comfortably ahead of her Conservative rival on 33 and Mr Taylor trailing a distant third on five per cent.Created with Sketch.General election: On the campaign trail Show all 114Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.

Pharmaceuticals, a family run pharmaceutical wholesaler in WatfordBut the Lib Dem’s decision to speak out may influence supporters of third-placed parties elsewhere in the country to switch in favour of the referendum-backing candidate most likely to beat the Conservative.In a message to voters on Twitter, Mr Taylor said: “You have a decision to make in Cardiff North tomorrow.“I’m standing to give voters dismayed by the big two a chance to vote Liberal Democrat. But if you want to deny Johnson and the Conservatives a majority, vote tactical not tribal.”Earlier, Mr Devlin issued a string of tweets saying that while\u0026nbsphe could not endorse Jeremy Corbyn or the Labour Party nationally, he regarded the party’s candidate in Stockton South Paul Williams as “an honest, sincere man”.Acknowledging the seat was “a LabCon battle”, he urged his supporters to “vote tactically for someone who cares about the NHS and social care” - effectively pointing them to put their cross next to Dr Williams’ name.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the poll suggests that if the Lib Dem candidate urged supporters to back Dr Williams, he could hold the seat by a margin of 48-43.Liberal Democrats have stood aside for Green and Plaid Cymru candidates as part of the Unite to Remain alliance, and are not putting up candidates against former Tory europhiles Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry. But leader Jo Swinson has set her face firmly against any deal with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour.VFS is calling on 14 more Lib Dem candidates and five from Labour to “get out of the way” of the drive to block a hard Brexit by halting their campaigns and urging supporters to vote for rivals who are better placed to defeat Tories.Among seats on the list were Liberal Democrat targets Cheadle, Cheltenham, Winchester, South Cambridgeshire and St Albans, where Jo Swinson’s party could be assured of victory if Labour voters threw their ballots behind the Lib Dem candidate.Constituencies where the group recommended Lib Dem candidates to stand aside included Brexit figurehead Iain Duncan Smith’s Chingford and Woodford Green, where the former Tory leader is believed to be vulnerable to a challenge from Faiza Shaheen, and Putney, where Labour are hoping to snatch the onetime seat of ex-minister Justine Greening.Elsewhere, VFS are urging Lib Dem candidates to stand aside in constituencies won by Labour in 2017 where Mr Corbyn’s party are hoping to avoid losses to Tories.They include Canterbury, where original Lib Dem choice Tim Walker stood down in favour of Labour’s pro-referendum Rosie Duffield, only for Ms Swinson to impose another candidate.Mr Walker said: “I beg other Lib Dem and Labour candidates in identical situations to my own to now look to their consciences and abandon their disreputable campaigns.“I know of dozens who know deep down what they’re doing is wrong. They should announce they are voting for the Labour or Lib Dem candidate who can win - and urge their supporters to do likewise.”Other seats where VFS are urging Lib Dems to step aside are Wakefield, Warrington South, Weaver Vale, Sedgefield, Gower, Eltham, Bristol North-West, Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Wirral West and Warwick and Leamington - all Labour in 2017 and all vulnerable to Tories.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While pointing to a small Johnson majority, the margin of error inevitable in any such survey meant the PM was by no means assured of clearing the 6-7 per cent majority believed to be needed to form a government, in a parliament where no other party is likely to be willing to form a coalition with him.Created with Sketch.General election: Facts and figures Show all 79Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.379 \u0027Big beasts\u0027 at risk479 Smallest majorities at 2017 general election579 Turnout at UK general elections679 General election 2019 poll of polls779 Vote shares at general elections since 1945879 Seats to watch in North-west England979 Women MPs at UK general elections1079 General election 2019 leaders\u0027 visits -

Voting tactically is the key to keeping the door open to a second referendum.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailTwo Liberal Democrats endorsed tactical votes for Labour rivals on the eve of polling day, in the hope of ensuring the better-placed pro-referendum candidate is able to defeat Conservatives in Stockton South and Cardiff North.In his final rally of the election campaign in east London, after a breakneck dash round the country which saw him visit Glasgow, Middlesbrough, Rotherham, Ashfield and Bedford, Mr Corbyn told supporters Thursday’s vote provided them with an opportunity to “shock the establishment by voting for hope”.“We stand at a fork in the road,” said the Labour leader. “The choice facing you, the people of this country, tomorrow is truly historic.”He warned that a Johnson victory would not mean life remaining the same, warning: “He will make it worse. He will open our NHS to takeover by American mega corporations and carry on with more cuts.“Tomorrow, vote for hope. Vote for real change.“When Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins. We all win. The future is ours to make together, and it’s time for real change for the many, not the few.”\u0026nbspMr Johnson, who began his day delivering milk to doorsteps in West Yorkshire before flying to South Wales and Essex, issued a polling-day plea to voters to “vote today to break the gridlock, vote to get Brexit done, vote to unleash Britain’s potential”.“The last parliament was so obsessed with arguing about Brexit, they were even arguing about arguing,” said the prime minister. “They were not focusing on what you, the people, want.“Enough is enough. This election is our chance to end the gridlock but the result is on a knife-edge.”But Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said the polls showed it was still “absolutely possible” to deny the Tories an overall majority through tactical voting.“We know from past elections that very often voters who vote tactically come to that conclusion in the final hours before they cast their vote,” she said.Campaigners for a Final Say referendum were planning a last-ditch push to encourage tactical voting to prevent a Johnson majority.People’s Vote was sending volunteers and resources to what it calls the ‘TV3’ constituencies where tactical voting can have the biggest impact – Esher \u0026amp Walton in Surrey, where Mr Raab is coming under pressure from Liberal Democrats, Tony Blair’s old seat of Sedgefield where Labour’s pro-referendum Phil Wilson is facing a challenge from Tories and Cheltenham, where Lib Dems are hopeful of regaining a seat which voted 57 per cent Remain.Campaign manager Stuart Hand said: “With the opening of polls just hours away voters’ minds are becoming laser-focused on what they can do to return a candidate who supports putting Brexit back to the people. The answer is very simple – vote tactically.“Just a few thousand people voting tactically across the country can make the difference between the disaster of Brexit and a people’s vote.”The Vote for a Final Say campaign released analysis of social media activity by Pulsar89up which showed that tactical voting was the third most-discussed topic online during the election campaign, behind Brexit and the NHS but ahead of issues like the economy and antisemitism.There have been more than 700,000 mentions of tactical voting on Twitter alone since the start of the campaign, with a significant spike after 5 December as polling day neared.VFS has been one of the heaviest spenders on Facebook in the last week of the election, sending out 2.7 millions adverts to 1.2 million voters in 29 ultra-marginal seats.Meanwhile, the Corbyn-backing Momentum movement was planning what it said would be “the biggest and most digitally-sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation in British political history” to maximise Labour’s support at the ballot box.The movement said that 5,600 people have so far pledged to spend the day campaigning, many of them in marginal constituencies.The non-partisan Vote For Your Future group will give more than 50,000 students a polling day reminder to vote, in a campaign of flyers and door knocking in more than 15 university locations across the country.Some 1.5 million under-25s registered to vote after the election was called – 37 per cent more than in 2017 – and with almost all universities still in term time, VFYF is aiming to ensure that students turn out in their highest numbers yet.“We’ve already seen record numbers of young people registering to vote – now it’s time to make ourselves heard at the ballot box,” said campaign director Lara Spirit.Polling stations open across the UK at 7am on 12 December and close at 10pm. More than 40 million people are thought to be eligible to vote, although the final figure will not be known until after the election has taken place.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it has NEVER been more important. The stakes have never been this high.You can back Boris Johnson — who makes a direct plea to Sun readers — to secure Brexit by January  and steer us into a bright new decade as a prosperous and independent nation outside the EU.If you don’t, oryou stay at home, you risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn’s extremists, who will reverse Brexit andus to the industrial carnage of the bleak s which his union paymasters consider a golden age.Back in  The Sun’s famous “lightbulb” front page warned of the nightmare of a Neil Kinnock Labour Government.That would have been a picnic compared with a Corbyn regime which threatens to drag our great country into a terrying and dark new era.GO ON MY SUNBoris Johnson has issued a personal appeal to Sun readers to #finish what we started# as the country votes in todays kne-edge election.In his open letter, the PM calls on all readers of Britain’s most popular paper to come to his aide by voting Tory to unite the country so it can finally move on.“I want us to get Brexit done. I want to focus on Sun readers’ priorities. I want to unleash this country’s potential,# he writes.“Above all I want to end the ision and bring this country back together again. Whether you voted Leave or Remain, you matter and your voice matters.“Give me a majority and I will finish what we started — what you instructed us to do — three-and-a -half years ago.

Haskell was big enough to pacy Wrighty, the series’ one real character, and Jenner was a waste of £, as she had everyone treading on PC eggshells and queuing up to assure us she was “an amazing, amazing woman”.Most of the rest were merely present and it was hard to have an opinion about almost any of them. Especially Adele, who had a picture of Jane McDonald rather than a personality, and Oddboddish Myles, who seemed to be using “the experience of a letime” to get his own cookery show. Not the reason most people would go in there.But a lot of this year’s contestants were young, tearful, mollycoddled, over-entitled, insecure products of our woke times and were treated accordingly by the production team, who bombarded the poor homesick little lambs with fry-ups, roast dinners, care packages, letters from home and so much food, most of them left the camp sounding like they’d just spent a fortnight at The Palms in Vegas.Roman: “That was the best thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Andy: “I loved every single minute of it.” Myles: “It’s been the most beautul time of my le.”Which was lovely for them but dull as hell for us, no matter how much they banged on about the “emotional rollercoaster ride” and missing their ruddy kids.Nor did it help Ant  Dec, who tried their brilliant best to inject laughter and running gags into the show. This, though, was one series of I’m A Celeb not even they could save.On Sunday it ended, appropriately enough, with victory for Jacqueline Jossa, who probably hoovered up the “Gloria Gaynor” block vote on account of her husband Dan Osborne’s off-screen shenanigans, which were far more interesting than anything that happened on screen.If this flat, tearful, commercially driven series got the winner it deserved, it certainly didn’t get the right epitaph from Ant.“One thing’s for sure,” he claimed confidently at the end, “We’ll never forget the class of .”And with that, I’d forgotten them.A FEW points to make regarding the BBC continuity announcer’s plug for Gemma Collins’ podcast, which kicked in during The Apprentice: You’re Fired credits.“I’ve got a great podcast to tell you about.” You haven’t.“It’s so entertaining.” It’s not.“Was Gemma Collins an elephant in a past le ” PAST FEELGOOD television story of the week Nish Kumar getting booed off stage at the Lord’s Taverners charity dinner. Proof he really hasn’t been paying attention to his Mash Report audience.If he had, Nish would’ve noticed they’re not laughing, they’re applauding in furious agreement about just how much they also hate the Tories, Boris, Trump and Brexit.Those of us who don’t share any of these left-wing prejudices, of course, are just meant to sit and meekly accept the abuse and the fact that all the least funny, most obnoxious and radioactively smug people on TV suddenly seem to have decided they’re the nation’s new moral compass and we’re racist bigots.What’s brilliant about the Lord’s Taverners story and accompanying internet footage of the audience is they refuse to play ball.

A decent majority will liberate him to secure Brexit by January .But Boris also has a zeal to radically improve Sun readers’ lives — and we would hold him to it.His rival for PM, Marxist Jeremy Corbyn, was yesterday branded a danger to national security by one of his OWN senior front-benchers, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth. A Boris victory would kill off that threat for ever.He would then be able to pour £billion extra into the NHS, hire , more cops to hammer crime, inject substantial new funding into schools and green-light multi-billion-pound, job-creating infrastructure projects.Plus, Boris will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT for five years.No sane politician can or should compete with the absurd freebies Corbyn claims he could dole out. Labour’s entire plan is a vast, ruinous fantasy, relying solely on the better-off sticking around to be hammered again and again for extra tax. The truth is everyone would pay for Marxist revolution.Boris, by contrast, would not bankrupt Britain. Nor wage war on private companies, as Corbyn would, and scare off investors, causing mass job losses.And, crucially, he tends to achieve what he sets out to. He ran for Mayor in Labour-dominated London and won twice. He led the Leave campaign to victory against the Remainer establishment. He was written off as a futureTory leader but won that too. He doggedly pursued, and won, the new Brexit deal every know-all said was impossible.Boris is being subjected to a tsunami of hate from Corbyn’s thugs and diehard Remainers who know he is Brexit’s last hope. Almost all of it is confected cobblers. Boris is as liberal as any of them.He is nothing like their hard-right caricature and they know it. Had he backed Remain they would love him.Boris is the right man to lead Britain into the s. And the alternative, as Corbyn’s own front-benchers privately admit, is too horric to think about.Vote Tory tomorrow.HEARING Corbyn branded a national security risk by one of his most senior frontbenchers is almost too much to grasp.Jon Ashworth, shadow health secretary, believes that his own leader is a danger to Britain. ThatCorbyn becomes PM on Friday the civil service will need to act rapidly to keep us all safe.The Sun has long considered Corbyn an unprecedented threat to our country. He is far closer to terrorists like Hamas than our No ally, America, which he detests. Our security partners would not trust him with classied information.But this taped confession tells us much about those around him too.In public Ashworth is a loyal Corbynista. In private he says Corbyn is a security threat and a loser who blocked Brexit. He longs to replace him with someone “half-decent”.He and his allies know their leader to be useless. Worse, they are beseeching voters to hand power to an extremist they know endangers every one of us.How can they look themselves in the mirror Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By not supporting Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist buddies, I am - I am told - an “age traitor”. Boris is for boomers, the thinking goes, and Corbyn is for us.But scratch the surface and you’ll find that the Prime Minister - a man who made his name as mayor of London - has rather a lot to offer us young folk. And Jeremy Corbyn - a Marxist straight from the s- might just make our lives a hell of a lot worse.Take, for example, the issue the vast majority of young people say matters to them most: housing.If you’re a young private renter, Corbyn’s radical plan to crackdown on “dodgy” landlords sounds really rather good.But there’s a serious catch. If landlords could be forced by the government to sell their homes to tenants at a price dictated by the Government, the buy-to-let market would collapse. And fast.In a few pockets of the country, where housing supply is plentul, that would be great. With landlords out of the picture, those desperate to get on the property ladder might stand a chance.In most of Britain, though, the picture wouldn’t be so rosy. Where available housing is precious and most people can’t afford to get on the housing ladderprivate renting is a blessing. And a collapse in the buy-to-let market would hike the price of it.So under Corbyn’s “fairer Britain”, those right at the start of their careers would soon be priced out of metropolitan areas.Then take university fees. Again, the idea of “free uni” sounds very tempting indeed. But under Corbyn’s regime, university tuition wouldn’t suddenly become free. It would just be paid for by the tax-payer instead of the student.What does that mean in practice  Well, it means that the  per cent of young people who opt to get a job end up at  would end up massively subsidising the  per cent who choose to enjoy three years of student le. I loved my time at uni, but I don’t see why my  year old cousin - who’s been working his socks off in the navy for three years - should be forced to pay for it.And evenyou are a student or planning to go to university, Corbyn won’t help you in any real sense. If students don’t contribute to their own education, universities suddenly have a lot less money. Which means they can’t admit as many teenagers.In Scotland, for example, where tuition has been “free” for years, fewer and fewer young people are going to university. And because the middle classes know how to game the system, it tends to be disadvantaged kids who get let down.Andyou work for yourself, which around % of Generation Z would like to do, Labour’s radical tax plan certainly isn’t for you.Even though Jeremy Corbyn has promised that only the richest five per cent of workers will face higher bills, new analysis shows that self-employed workers earning much less could be £, a year worse off under the new rules. And sole traders - ie. young, ambitious entrepreneurs who pay themselves lower salaries in order to invest in their businesses - would suffer the most.Boris Johnson might not be a hit at Glastonbury. But like a true One Nation Conservative, he believes in opportunity. And his pragmatic schemes, like % deposit mortgages, would give hard working young people a proper leg up in le.I don’t hunt, I don’t shoot, and I wouldn’t be seen dead in tweed. But I believe that a country can only succeed when ambitious young people are encouraged by the state to spread their wings and fly. Not given countless handouts by a bankrupt Government.So tomorrow, I’ll be voting Conservative with pride.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it has NEVER been more important. The stakes have never been this high.You can back Boris Johnson — who makes a direct plea to Sun readers — to secure Brexit by January  and steer us into a bright new decade as a prosperous and independent nation outside the EU.If you don’t, oryou stay at home, you risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn’s extremists, who will reverse Brexit andus to the industrial carnage of the bleak s which his union paymasters consider a golden age.Back in  The Sun’s famous “lightbulb” front pagewarned of the nightmare of a Neil Kinnock Labour Government.That would have been a picnic compared with a Corbyn regime which threatens to drag our great country into a terrying and dark new era.Imagine you wake tomorrow to find Jeremy Corbyn, even in defeat, somehow cobbling together a Government in which the Scottish Nationalists and Lib Dems call the shots.Imagine this appalling Remainer pact drafting a new, rigged Brexit referendum and another hideously isive Scottish independence vote.Imagine them radically altering the voting rules to ensure hard-Left power for a generation.Imagine that the Pound has already crashed, hundreds of billions are being pulled out of the country and our global allies are making contingency plans to freeze out our new Marxist Prime Minister, considered a national security risk not just by them but by his own health secretary.This is not some scare story The Sun has invented. It is inevitableBoris Johnson has agonisingly too few seats for a working majority.As the economy begins its rapid descent into ruin, with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs — maybe including yours — imagine how you will feelyou didn’t go out and vote to prevent it.The Sun has warned for years how dangerous Corbyn, his creepy shadow chancellor John McDonnell and their Communist aides are.We highlighted how they backed the IRA while it was executing our soldiers and civilians. How Corbyn considers Arab terrorists “friends” while loathing the West and our No ally America in particular.We told how his anti-Semitism had drawn Jew-hating bigots to his party like flies to a cesspit and led to Labour becoming only the second party after the fascist BNP to be probed for racism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.We described how he and McDonnell revel in left-wing thuggery and foster a vicious hatred of opponents, exemplied by their repulsive social media trolls and the flashmobs that publicly vily and intimidate Tories.They have created a party of hypocrites and liars for whom no fabrication is too bigit damages the Tories they detest. A party which built an election campaign around a monstrous hood about the Tories “selling the NHS” to Trump.Corbyn was a joke once. Now, with this election as tight as it is, he is on the brink of power. It should terry every sane person in Britain. It is shocking that it does not. It is profoundly depressing to see people supposedly opposed to racism give Labour’s anti-Semitism a free pass asit is a “lesser” prejudice, even a socially acceptable one. Tell that to terried British Jews, resigned to emigrating to escape Corbyn. Or to the  former Labour MPs who yesterday begged the public not to vote for their old boss for precisely this reason.What has our country become that such a toxic, dangerous party could be within a mile of power  A party which derives its energy from grievance and hate  What has happened to our education system that the insane high-tax, business-destroying economics of Corbyn and McDonnell, which have brought ruin everywhere they have been applied, are discussed as a serious possibility  That despite mass starvation in Venezuela, which Corbyn held up as his model, his young fans still believe the same system is worth a go The answer is austerity and its successful weaponisation by a Labour Party relying on voters forgetting why it was necessary. Well, here’s a reminder: In  the global financial crisis and Labour’s scandalous over-spending left us heading for bankruptcy. Labour was borrowing nearly £billion a WEEK and left incoming Tories a snarky note: “Dear Chief Secretary. I’m afraid there is no money.”They thought it was FUNNY. The cost was nine long years of cuts, vital to get our finances back in order. These are now presented as a cruel Tory “choice”. That is nonsense. They had no alternative.But, yes, public services have struggled. The NHS is short-staffed and cannot keep pace with an older, sicker and rapidly expanding population. Police cuts have hurt the fight against crime.Homes are far too expensive for young people, particularly in the South. Many of those don’t recall Labour’s financial disaster. They just want change and an economic stake in society. But they and too many others who will vote Labour because they are sick of “Tory cuts” forget why they happened:Labour wrecked the economy. The Tories had to fix it.Boris is a dferent Tory, unafraid to spend big to pump le back into “left-behind” communities.His economic programme is far more lavish than that of Theresa May or David Cameron. He will plough billions more into the NHS, police, schools and new infrastructure projects. He has a zeal to regenerate regions that fell behind as London flourished. Mrs May talked about it. Boris will do it.And, yes, a Tory majority WILL deliver Brexit on January . But you are going to have to vote for it.Too many think they voted for Brexit once, it didn’t happen and they can’t be bothered voting any more. That all politicians are liars, so why trust any  Or that Nigel Farage has promised to deliver Brexit too, so you’ll vote for him.These would be disastrous errors.Farage’s party will not win seats. A vote for his Brexit Party is one lost to the Tories, as several Farage candidates have now admitted.Andyou’re a Remainer Tory who dislikes Boris, a vote for the Lib-Dems is not a “free hit”. It’s a vote for chaos, from which Corbyn is almost certain to emerge as PM.The stark reality is Britain cannot afford for Boris to fall short.Soyou are inclined to vote Tory you MUST go out today and do it.Boris has been in power only four months, hamstrung all along by a Remainer Parliament. He could be a great PM and deserves a chance.Go out and vote Tory today. Save Brexit, and save Britain from Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The choice facing you, the people of this country, tomorrow is truly historic.“The establishment doesn’t want Labour to win.” He added: “Tomorrow you can shock the establishment by voting for hope.Hope for yourself. Hope for your family. Hope for your community. Hope for our NHS. Hope for our country.”Mr Corbyn jubilantly declared “Labour is going to win the election” as he warned Boris Johnson to “look out”.On a -minute visit to Glasgow, Mr Corbyn blanked media amid a storm over his health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth trashing Labour’s chances in a leaked phone call. Instead Mr Corbyn declared class war on the wealthy.Slamming the Tories, he said: “Their’s is the party of billionaires, ours is the party of the many.“Tomorrow you can vote for despair and vote for the dishonesty of this government, or you can vote Labour and get a government that can bring hope to the future.”He then zipped down to Middlesbrough where shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald led the audience of around  Labour supporters in a festive singalong.The Corbynista frontbencher sang: “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Johnson needs to go.“He’ll have to leave Number Ten, it’s time to get Labour in, they made a mess the Tories need to go.“It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas lots of ho ho ho. But the prettiest sight to see, will be Jeremy by the tree by No’s front door.”Labour’s party chairman Ian Lavery also boasted about their chances. Leaping to the stage, he yelled: “It’s within our grasp — we are only inches away from the winning line.”Brandishing the little red book containing their manesto, he said Labour will “transform society”.But Mr Corbyn had to pull out of two planned stops in Ashfield and Broxtowe as he ran out of time.New evidence of the cost of a Corbyn government emerged. Tory research discovered that Labour’s economic plans could send the cost of an average Christmas rocketing by a third.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell would like to implement a tax on food based on the number of air miles travelled. The nation’s favourite roast potatoes – maris pipers grown in Israel – would cost an extra p.A frozen stuffed Iceland Perfect Turkey Crown would cost another £. — as they come from Hungary. Sprouts, jetted in from South Africa, would cost £. extra.Christmas day costs the average family £ — butCorbyn wins, this could jump up another £.Meanwhile, Labour’s shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis has called for the government to give up trying to make Britain’s economy bigger.Mr Lewis has penned a chapter in Extinction Rebellion handbook This is not a Drill calling for ministers to “abandon the fetish of growth”. He is one of John McDonnell’s key deputies and would help run the economyLabour win.Tory ministers warned a Corbyn government would cost jobs, drive down wages, and ruin the economy.Treasury Minister Rishi Sunak said: “Don’t wake up on Friday the th to the nightmare of a Corbyn Sturgeon coalition.Corbyn’s plans wouldn’t just make your Christmas expensive, it would cost you an extra £, in taxes every year.”Treasury Minister Simon Clarke warned: “Corbyn’s Labour would wreck the economy and leave the country unable to pay for anything.”Last night Mr Corbyn prematurely declared victory in the social media election war.Labour said their videos notched up .million views on Facebook compared with m for the Tories.Mr Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell need to “hear first hand about the impact of terror on families”, the group said.It added Mr Corbyn was “not just a sympathiser of the IRA but a supporter”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It says “Friday th”. Then I hear a horrible cackling — and, OMG, it’s Diane Abbott standing by my bed, her face split open with mirth.“We’re in charge now!” she shrieks: “Ha ha ha ha ha.” And then the rest of the ghouls appear.Magic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn, smirking through his beard, wearing his Lenin hat. Jo Swinson of the Lib Dems like a Girl Guide Leader from Hades. And then — grinning like Janette Krankie on acid — Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP.I try to hide under the covers but Diane pulls them back. “We’re in charge now,” she repeats. “And first we’re going to wreck Brexit. And then we’re going to wreck the country. Ha ha ha ha.”Friday, December  is the day we find out who will be ruling us for the next five years. And my nightmare could quite possibly come true.I’ve been saying for ages that the idiotic Corbyn could win this election — without actually winning any more seats.It is an incredibly precarious position for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives — and thus for Brexit.The polls seem to be tightening. The Conservatives haven’t run a terribly good campaign, it’s true.All it needs is another drop in the Tory lead of one per cent and we would be heading for a hung Parliament.That almost certainly means a government led by Corbyn, with support from the Lib Dems and the SNP. It would definitely mean an end for Brexit.The democratic decision we took three years ago would be forgotten. At best there would be ANOTHER referendum.Almost certainly rigged by Labour and the Lib Dems to ensure that, this time, the right side won, ie, their side.They have no respect whatsoever for that democratic mandate. They are very clear about that. But there will be even worse to come.Labour will usher in a ruinous economic programme which the country cannot possibly afford.Our entrepreneurs will flee the country. We’ll be back in huge debt once again. Spending on stuff we cannot afford.Labour plans to spend TWENTY EIGHT times as much money as the ConservativesWorst of all, we will be led by a halfwit who supports every enemy known to this country.You name a terrorist cell or a vile, authoritarian country and mad old Jezza will at some point have offered it support.From the IRA to the genocidal Islamists Hamas, from Cuba to Iran.The brilliant website Guido Fawkes has detailed all the times Corbyn has stuck up for terrorists or horrible totalitarian governments. Gawd help us, the list is almost endless.This is a bloke who has said he wishes Nato didn’t exist. That’s the military alliance which has kept peace for  years!But don’t take my word for it. Just this week yet another Labour MP was caught moaning about how truly bloody awful Corbyn was.Jonathan Ashworth said voters were turned off by the man and that the prospects for Labour were “dire”.He added: “I’m helping colleagues, banging on about the NHS for them, but it’s awful for them, and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit . . . outside of the city seats . . . it’s abysmal out there . . . they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.”That’s not “Tory lies”, as the lefties always say when someone takes a pop at the old scrote.That’s a member of his own front-bench team. But then a good two thirds of Labour MPs can’t stand Corbyn and think he would be awful for this country.As Boris Johnson said, Ashworth was only saying what hundreds of Labour candidates and millions of voters were thinking.You wonder why some of those candidates don’t have the courage of their convictions and stand down.In fact, plenty have already done so. Ivan Lewis, for example, who has urged everybody to vote Conservative.Then there was John Woodcock and Ian Austin. Both former Labour MPs, moderates. They even made placards telling people to vote Tory.More MPs left Labour long ago — such as Chuka Umunna, who is now standing as a Liberal Democrat, and Brexiteer Kate Hoey can’t bring herself to support the party she served for  years.The man and his retinue of Trots — John McDonnell, Rebecca Long-Bailey , the ghastly Diane Abbott — are a laughing stock. Except I don’t find very much to laugh about, to tell you the truth.And along with Labour and the Lib Dems will come more stupid, socially isive identity politics. The whole country ided up into competing victimhoods.Gay, transgender, black, Asian. Asthese were the things which define us as human beings.But then that’s the infantile and damaging way the Left sees the world.Given all this, you might think it incredible that Corbyn could ever get the keys to No Downing Street. So many people despise the bloke.And that’s before we factor in his repellent anti-Semitism .And you might look at the polls and think — well, the Tories still have a decent lead. Nothing much to worry about.It won’t be Friday th or Nightmare On Abbott Street. It might well be Groundhog Day, but that’s preferable. But this is the big problem for BoJo and his Conservative team. Complacency. The suspicion on the part of the electorate that Corbyn could never actually win. When he could win all too easily — and don’t forget, the opinion polls are very often wrong.The other problem for the Tories is, of course, the Brexit Party. They are still fielding candidates in seats up and down the country — seats which the Tories need to win in order to form a government.Some senior figures in the Brexit Party have already said they would be far better off backing the Tories in order to get Brexit done.But Brexit Party boss Nigel Farage will not listen to them.So we have the terrible situation where people might vote for the Brexit Party in order to make sure we leave the European Union — but in doing so actually STOP Brexit from occurring.Becausethe Brexit Party takes lots of votes from the Tories, that lets in Labour and the Lib Dems through the back door. And the result  No Brexit.It’s in those seats in the North and Midlands where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to a high Brexit Party vote.This is a crucial election. Not just for Brexit, but for Britain’s future.That means a vote for the Conservatives, no matter how much that sticks in the craw.I’ve mentioned before that the only time I voted Tory I felt pretty glum afterwards.But this time there really is no alternative except in a tiny handful of seats where the Tories cannot possibly win.Once this election is out of the way, we need a new party to provide opposition to the Tories.A party that will replace Labour. For me, that’s the Social Democrats. But we’re not at that stage yet.For now it’s a case of walking to the polling booth, holding your nose and voting Blue.You decide our government. You may have your doubts about our democracy — I don’t blame you! You may feel uneasy voting Tory — don’t blame you for that, either.But you hold the destiny of our country in your hands.Indeed, when you put that cross in a box, you ARE the government. The person who decides what is best for our country.So make your vote count, please — and banish those nightmares for ever. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every vote for Labour brings the Corbyn revolution a step closer.That catastrophe could easily happen this week.In recent opinion polls, the Tories have maintained a consistent lead over Labour by about  per cent - enough for a comfortable majority.But in some surveys, the gap has fallen to just  points, while one poll at the weekend suggested a Conservative majority of just .Moreover, as the last two General Elections proved, the polls can be badly wrong. The result this time could go down to the wire.What the country needs to ensure Corbyn’s defeat is a vast coalition of voters united by the one aim of keeping him out of Downing Street.This was meant to be the Brexit election but it has rightly turned into a referendum on Corbyn’s spectacular unfitness for high office.And the only result should be a wholesale rejection of his bid for power.To achieve that, all anti-Corbyn voters – no matter what their past allegiances or their personal hostility to Johnson – must vote tactically for the Conservatives.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow Chancellor John McDonnell must be stoppedThroughout the campaign, Remain supporters have talked feverishly of the potential for anti-Tory tactical voting to stop Brexit.But far more potent would be a wave of pro-Tory tactical voting to keep out Corbyn.At the heart of such a drive must lie the millions of decent, patriotic voters in Labour’s heartlands of the North and the Midlands, who have backed the party all their lives but are now profoundly disillusioned with Corbyn.If they held their noses and supported Johnson, then Labour would face annihilation.There are already signs that this could be happening.The so-called “Red Wall” of around  Labour marginals from Yorkshire to Wales, characterised by seats like Bolsover in Derbyshire and Crewe in Cheshire, appears to be crumbling.If a new army of Red Tory voters materialises on Thursday, the damage to Corbyn could be phenomenal.This week were reports that Labour are even in trouble in Leigh, where Joanne Platt has a majority of almost , and which is only th on the Tories’ target list.Similarly, the latest poll in the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby, which has been held by Labour for generations, shows a big lead for the Tories.This mood of revolt against political loyalties was captured in the words of one café worker in Labour-held Wrexham, North Wales, who said at the weekend: “I’ve always voted Labour and my family always voted Labour. On Thursday I shall be voting Tory.”People like her recognise that traditional Labour – the party of Clem Attlee, John Smith and Tony Blair – is now dead, replaced by a dogmatic, intolerant movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.The election campaign has only reinforced Labour’s unfitness for office.Lavish pledges of free services and extravagant spending increases have been dished out like confetti, shattering the last remnants of the party’s economic credibility.Meanwhile, Labour has nothing coherent to say about Brexit beyond the threat of yet more dither and delay.It is no wonder that the five million Labour voters who backed Leave in the  referendum are in such despair.Boris himself put it well on a visit to Grimsby yesterday when he said that Labour’s Brexit stance represented “the great betrayal, orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes.”But it is not just Leave voters who should back the Tories. Remainers who loathe the idea of a Corbyn regime should do so as well.A hard-left Government is too big a price for stopping Brexit, for which the British people democratically voted three years ago.The arch pro-EU Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, now standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency, said recently that he was “absolutely satisfied that Mr Corbyn would be a disaster in Downing Street.”Yet Grieve is making that dire possibility more likely by trying to siphon off votes from the Tory party.Indeed, all the opposition parties are acting as Corbyn’s allies, whatever their protestations.Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in particular, could still badly split the anti-Corbyn vote in a string of Northern and Midlands seats, like Hartlepool.The latest poll in the constituency shows the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories on  per cent, a far higher combined total of Labour’s  per cent.In Doncaster North, held by Ed Miliband, Labour is on  per cent against a combined total of  per cent for the Brexit Party and the Conservatives.Further south, a vote for Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats is realistically a vote for Corbyn, just as in Scotland, support for the SNP will help to propel Corbyn into Downing Street.The choice is stark. Our country’s security, liberty and growth can only be secured by theof a Conservative Government.There is nothing to fear from the continuation in office of Boris Johnson, who stands in the long tradition of one-nation Conservatism epitomised by Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill.But there is everything to fear from Corbyn’s ascent to power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why Donald Trump wants Boris Johnson to win. Tomorrow you can shock the establishment by voting for hope.  “Hope for yourself. For your family. For your community. For our NHS. For our country. When Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the ­engineer wins. We all win.” Mr Corbyn called on activists to spend today convincing undecided voters to back Labour, after an ugly ­election campaign marred by disgraceful smears on his character and a string of blatant lies and empty promises by Mr Johnson. He also had a dig at the PM for repeatedly ducking questions – and his latest bid to avoid scrutiny by hiding in a fridge on a milk round. Mr Corbyn, who embarked on a -mile trip speaking to crowds around the land, told a Middlesbrough meeting: “I’ve not come here to deliver milk, or to hide in a fridge.  “I’ve come here with a message of hope.

The Labour leader touched down in the marginal seat of Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, which fell to the Tories last time round, on a whistlestop tour of the United Kingdom hoping to convince voters there to come back to the party. Mr Corbyn, who seemed in good spirits, told those gathered in the cold: Iaposve not come here to deliver milk - or to hide in a fridge, with a dig at the Prime Minister who went on a milkround in the marginal seat of Guiseley, in Yorkshire and hid from cameras in a fridge. Instead the Labour leader declared: Iaposve come here with a message of hope. Mr Corbyn arrived from Glasgow, where he kicked off the final day of campaigning, to a crowd warmed up by Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald who sang his own version of Itaposs Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas including the lines Johnsonaposs got to go. While Laura Pidcock, who has a fight on her hands in North West Durham, told supporters to go out and campaign telling them that every conversation over the next few hours will count. She said: “Every single conversation you have had will absolutely be worth it. There are people right now who do not know who they are going to vote for and it our job to have a conversation with every single one of those people who do not know who they are going to vote for and tell them that a better society is possible.”  Labour Party chair Ian Lavery had a more direct challenge to undecided voters telling them it was time to ask themselves which side are you on .He told activists: When you knock on peopleaposs doors in communities up and down the country when they say they donapost know ask them are they prepared to see people in the foreseeable future kids in poverty, kids going to school with holes in their shoes, kids going to school without the right attire in these freezing cold conditions, not even having food in their bellies, .m kids in poverty, lots of them in areas like this We cannot allow this to continue. A smiling Mr Corbyn told activists: “I am utterly determined we go flat out between now and pm tomorrow evening to get everyone to vote, and hopefully vote Labour and recognise in our manesto there is hope, there is something positive.” He urged them to do all they could in these crucial last hours. Mr Corbyn told campaigners: “Please do absolutely everything you can to win in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and all the other marginal constituencies. It is our chance tomorrow to elect a government that will be for the many not the few.”  After his brief stop in the north east the Labour leader is travelling across country to the East Midlands ahead of a visit to Bedford and a final rally in London before a home crowd. Labour have an uphill fight to win over undecided voters after the latest polling showed Boris Johnson on track to win a -seat majority. Speaking after the Middlesbrough rally Mr Corbyn refused to speak about the numbers in the YouGov MRP poll.  He said: “I never ever comment on opinion polls the only poll that matters is the one tomorrow.” Askedhe should resignLabour fails to get a majority he replied: “I think you should concentrate on the election and the fact that Labour is going to win the election.” The Labour leader had told activists that he had run a positive campaign slamming the abuse he and the party had received. He said: “We now have had  days of this campaign and  days of unbelievable levels of abuse hurled at leading figures of the Labour Party, unbelievable levels of character assassinations going on against our party and our movement and I simply say this,you wish to inhabit the gutter, that’s absolutely fine by me but I will not be joining you there. Asked why he believed that he was still on course to enter Number , he replied: “We’ve had six weeks in which we’ve been campaigning all over the country six weeks in which we’ve been under relentless media assault against my party nevertheless our message has got through a message that we will protect the NHS we won’t do secret deals with the United States”.

The Labour leader said he “feels the pain” of millions of people trying to get by and is determined to make the country a fairer place. And he made a heartfelt promise to protect the NHS after our stories about desperate families struggling to get treatment from the struggling health service. In his final interview before polling day, Mr Corbyn revealed what put the fire in his belly as he appealed to undecided voters to back him to be the next Prime Minister. “I feel the pain of the people I represent, the pain of trying to bring up children in a small overcrowded flat, and wanting them to do well and wanting them to achieve at school,” he said. “I think of the people saying theyaposve got three children with quite wide age gap sharing a bedroom, one wants to play music, one wants to do their homework, one wants to play with Lego on the floor. “They just end up fighting for space, then those children donapost achieve what they could at school and their whole le path is damaged because we, the community as a whole, did not provide the housing they need. Itaposs that sort of thing that drives me to change things in our society.” Speaking to the Mirror on Labouraposs battlebus in the North West of England, he added: “Le can be cruel to many people and I want us to have a much fairer society.” Mr Corbyn revealed that his first act on becoming PM would be to allocate emergency funding for more hostel places to help those sleeping on the streets. “Iaposll do something urgently about the rough-sleeping crisis around the country as a symbol of what we are determined to do to end the injustice of the housing crisis,” he said. Labour will also prioritise shoring up the NHS in its first weeks in power – after the Mirror published a series of devastating stories about children struggling to get treatment. “It is an utter disgrace in a civilized world, we can do better. It indicates just how desperate the situation is in our health service,” he said.  But he backed away from personally attacking Boris Johnsonaposs handling of the situation. “I would rather go out there and be positive about what we want to achieve. People can make their own judgements on Boris Johnson when confronted with a picture of a child on the floor of the hospital, compared with the approach that we would take.” He praised his shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth as “absolutely brilliant” despite a leaked conversation in which he predicted they would lose the election as a result of Brexit and Mr Corbynaposs leadership. The Labour leader revealed Mr Ashworth had called him up straight away and was “mortied” and “very upset” that his “banter” had been published. “Heaposs working flat out for a Labour government. I know that and I think heaposs been absolutely brilliant on health and I think we just move on,” Mr Corbyn said. But he acknowledged candidatesapos concerns that Labouraposs Brexit policy was coming up regularly on the doorstep in Leave seats. He admitted that many people were “fed up” with Brexit but that any deal needed to be one that protected people’s livelihoods and security. “Iaposm sure many people are fed up and bored with it,” he said. “Iaposve had as my bottom line that I would prevent a no deal Brexit and would prevent a trade deal with Donald Trump that would sell off our public services.” He admitted it was going to be “dficult” to resolve the issue once and for all but he wanted to try to represent both the % and % as it was the “sensible, grown-up” approach. “I recognise that itaposs going to be dficult. I donapost want to represent just the % or the %, I want to represent the people as a whole”. A Labour government would spend three months negotiating a Leave deal with the EU that wouldnapost destroy industry and then put it – and Remain – to a public confirmatory vote in six months. Its negotiating team would include Brexiteer Labour MPs as well as Remainer ones. “It will be people who have dfering views,” he said. But he admitted his decision not to campaign for either side was “not easy”. He added: “What  could we as a party do to represent people who voted both ways in the referendum  Anything  would be even harder.”  And he warned that under Boris Johnson the risk of a damaging no deal Brexit at the end of  was very high. Mr Corbyn, who has been accused of not being tough enough on security, insisted the first job of any government was to “keep the country safe and secure”. He talked passionately about the welfare of armed forces personnel and cited their pride in missions including rescuing refugees, dealing with the Ebola crisis and UN peacekeeping. “Our armed services are there, yes to protect us against attack, but also there to deal with the insecurities that come from poverty, from environmental disaster and from refugee flows.” Asked whether he could envisage a scenario where he would be prepared to deploy troops for security reasons, he replied: “I would hope we didnapost have to, but of course you have to be prepared to defend society”. Throughout his leadership, Mr Corbyn has faced allegations of not dealing with anti-semitism in party ranks swtly or tough enough. “Antisemitism is utterly evil. Obviously weaposll continue to clamp down on it,” he said. He suggested that Labour could adopt recommendations from the ongoing Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry in full. “Theyaposre only looking at processes and so yes... Weaposd look at it of course. I would imagine we would implement them but theyaposve not made any suggestions yet.” Mr Corbyn was last week accused of being unpatriotic for not watching the Queenaposs Christmas message – but claried that he had watched news bulletins in the morning. “When her Majesty finally gets to make the speech we all know whataposs in it because weaposve seen the trails on it. There was a bit of miscommunication between the interviewer and myself on that. I think weaposre now cool.” He and we Laura Alez, who was sitting next to him on the battle bus, would celebrate Christmas together “hopefully in No , thataposs the idea”. He claimed that “we both” do the cooking but was interrupted by his we who added: “Mainly me”. What was he getting her for Christmas  “A present.” They laughed. “Something nice and something surprising”. But would he have the time to go shopping  “I make time. If you want something done, ask a busy person.” Mr Corbyn claimed he was able to cope with the scale of personal abuse he sometimes faced from the media – but that he worried about his family. “It gets to people around me more than it does me. It is very stressful for family and friends who get very angry on my behalf and feel thereaposs been a lot of unfairness. “I have been active in politics all of my le and I do it because I believe in it. You get personal abuse. Iaposm not replying to it, Iaposm not getting into the gutter with anybody.” He did not criticise Labour candidates for choosing not to put his name or picture on leaflets. “Itaposs up to them what they put on their literature. Nothing bothers me. The only thing that bothers me is winning the election. Itaposs not a Presidential election, itaposs a parliamentary election and Iaposm proud to be Leader of the party.” Mr Corbyn ruled out endorsing tactical voting but admitted he was “looking forward” to seeing Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of universal credit, lose his seat to his Labour rival.  “Iaposm not in favour of tactical voting. I want the Labour message to be there clearly all across the country.” He has ruled out forming a coalition in the event of a hung Parliament and asked whether he would stand downhe lost insisted: “I donapost intend to lose”. But after shadow chancellor John McDonnell appealed for the next Labour leader to be a woman, Mr Corbyn yesterday admitted there was a “fair case” for that to happen. He also hopes that in the future there would be two Labour deputies – a man and a woman. Mr Corbyn revealed the first thing he would do on walking through the famous black door of No  would be to check out the coffee machine – so he would be equipped to work late into the night.

A shocking image of little Jack on the Mirror’s front page became the biggest story of the election. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was slammed for refusing to look at the photo during a car-crash interview with an ITV reporter. Mum Sarah Williment, , from Leeds, said: “Never be afraid to speak out on issues that affect your children. I have no regrets in standing up for my child.” It was suspected that Jack had pneumonia and because of a bed shortage, he spent more than four hours on a floor and a further five on a trolley. He was later diagnosed with flu and tonsillitis. Jack, four, has fully recovered from his ordeal and is back at school, thanks to the care he received at Leeds General Infirmary. “The doctors and nurses were wonderful,” Sarah said as she thanked the public for their support. The hospital yesterday rejected unfounded social media claims that the story and photos were fake, and apologised to the family again.  NHS bosses re-issued their original statement, which said: “We would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family.” Sarah had already accepted the apology and said: “I have no issue with the hospital or the staff. Everyone there is doing their very best for the patients and we are extremely grateful for all the work they do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"paul routledge lets not abandon","story":"NewsopinionPaul Routledge: Lets not abandon Labour when its needed the mostThis gang of lying, scheming Tories, the off-scourings of Eton and the City, have no claim on our votes.

Vote Labour to keep alive the vision of Denis Healey, Barbara Castle and Harold Wilson for a better society. Generations of working people in Lancashire, Yorkshire and the North-East fought to sustain that dream and turn it into reality. Equality for women, massive council house building and increased social security. We supported New Labour, enabling Gordon Brown to pursue the goal, investing hugely in hospitals, schools, pensions and a surer start for kids. Let’s not abandon that loyalty now, when it’s needed most to save the NHS and alleviate hardship among the working poor, pensioners and children. Believe me, there are more important things in le than Brexit, when it might happen or evenit might happen. Like, how we live and who we trust to govern the country. And by those counts, this gang of lying, scheming Tories, the off-scourings of Eton and the City, have no claim on our votes. Remember , the Thatcher years when our gas, water and electricity were sold off to speculators, mostly foreign. Remember, the lads throwing themselves off the Tyne Bridge because they couldn’t find work. Remember the hundreds of thousands of miners, engineers, shipyard workers and utility employees who lost their jobs in the  wasted years of Thatcher’s reign. And the equally huge numbers of teachers, nurses, town hall staff, prison officers, youth and social workers and probation officers made redundant in the nine wasted years of Cameron, May and now Johnson governments. Tory rule has made Britain an unhappier place to live. Homelessness is on the increase, rough sleeping is out of control. Fewer and fewer people have a secure job, as the so-called “gig economy” booms, while the super-rich hide their wealth in tax havens overseas.

But determined not to let the condition change his le, Dom carried on working as a customer service manager at TSB in Sunderland to support his family, even while having a form of chemotherapy. Dom spent weeks in hospital being treated with Lemtrada, which works to reset the immune system. He had two courses of the treatment,  months apart,  which aims to reduce the number of relapses by about %. Thankfully the treatment, at the Sunderland Royal Hospital, was a success.  “After the second treatment, I felt my le turn around and I had a renewed vigour and energy,” says Dom, now , and a Customer Service Team Manager at the Sunderland Contact Centre.“Mentally the whole has process has been tough as I didn’t know anything about the condition.” Determined to help others like him, the now father-of-two wants to give back.

I also feel it is really important to raise awareness as it’s a relatively unknown condition - so people who have been newly diagnosed don’t know what they are facing.  Thankfully I have received many dferent treatments to keep the condition under control.” Dom, who is now planning further feats including the London Landmarks half-marathon in March, added: “I want to give something back as I am currently feeling the best I have felt since my diagnosis.

Juliet Blaxland, , told the Mirror in September that she believed her home, one the furthest east in the UK, would be safe for at least five years. But violent autumn storms, alongside big tides, triggered a dramatic increase in erosion, with nine metres of land lost in the past four months. After the .-metre section fell away overnight in a “cataclysmic event” last week, engineers found the row of three cottages was now  metres from the clf and unsafe. Juliet and husband Giles Stibbe, , will move home next week. Juliet said: “We knew all along it would eventually be demolished but it has caught us by surprise, as we could have reasonably expected another year here. “But ever since we moved in we were always aware of how little time we had left.  “Demolition is incredibly sad. It’s the end of an era.” She said that the house is a “landmark” in Easton Bavents, East Suffolk. The village, north of Southwold, used to have a church, a thriving market and many houses. But unrelenting erosion has virtually des­­troyed the community. Juliet and Army veteran Giles moved into the ham­­let  years ago, renting from the local farmer. Since then they have seen the demolition of several houses and the disappearance of the land between them and the sea. And engineers have now told the farm owner that all cottage tenants should leave. Demolition crews are expected to raze the homes over Christmas.  Architect Juliet and Giles are moving up the coast to the village of Benacre. The area suffers from erosion, too, but their new home is far enough inland to be safe... for now. Coastal Partnership East, a group formed by several local councils, has been monitoring the situation.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who has had to use AE three times in the last few months said she has spent more than  hours waiting for treatment. The state of the NHS has been bared open by Hannah Price after she needed urgent medical care in the last few months. Recalling when her daughter Penelope first fell ill just two weeks after she was born, Hannah said she burst into tears when she arrived at Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital. The -year-old from Chorlton, said there were more than  sickly children waiting for help.She told the Manchester Evening News : It was absolutely rammed.There was more than  children, all of them looking horrically ill. People were lining the corridors and lying on the floor. I had to wait [in a queue] for thirty minutes just to talk to the receptionist. Hannah and Penelope endured a -hour wait until the tot, who was suffering severe jaundice, was allocated a neonatal bed. And even then, they had to stay in the cramped assessment unit, rather than a ward. Hannah has praised hospital staff for the exceptional care they have provided but said she was shocked to witness how much pressure they are under and the NHS.  She said: I was still recovering from the birth so I was in a lot of pain. During the wait we only had a car seat because the midwives had told us to go to AE straight away. I was just putting her down and picking her back up again all the time. I was breastfeeding but there was no food to feed myself.  I couldnapost leave with her in case we got called. Hannahaposs husband Oliver was them, but he eventually had to leave to look after the coupleaposs other two children aged four and . When we finally got the incubator I texted him and he replied aposOh my God that was a fourteen-hour waitapos, said Hannah. It was absolutely mad.  Penelope has since recovered from her episode of jaundice and received fantastic care at Manchester Childrenaposs hospital.The same was true when Hannah gave birth at St Maryaposs and when she had to visit Wythenshawe AE two weekends ago when Penelope has suspected had sepsis .But again, both visits involved substantial waits for a bed. In September, Hannah was admitted to the maternity unit at St Maryaposs to be induced, but it was a further six days before a bed could be found on the labour ward where she gave birth to Penelope.  She said: They wouldnapost let me go home so my husband had to go off for a week to look after the children. He had to use his paternity leave early while I waited in the hospital. I was under consultant-led care and I was surprised I had to wait so long. When I got a bed, everything went fine, I couldnapost fault the staff.  But theyaposre just so pushed, it was so busy all the time. Itaposs such a big hospital and I feel like theyaposve not got enough staff to deal with it. After Hannahaposs two previous experiences she decided to go to Wythenshawe hospital when Penelope suffered another health scare a fortnight ago. She had a temperature of , initially I called  and they told me to get a doctoraposs appointment, said Hannah.  But then her arms suddenly went really cold and mottled. I rang  again and they said that could be sepsis and itaposs emergency so you have to go straight to AE. I thought it would be a bit quieter at Wythenshawe but we ended up waiting for six hours. I thought with it being suspected sepsis they would admit her straight away.  Luckily it wasnapost sepsis, it was a viral infection. They treated her with with fluids and antibiotics and she was was in hospital for three days. Once again, Hannah says she received exceptional care at Wythenshawe, but believes her experience highlights the strain the NHS is under. The staff are absolutely brilliant, she said.  I spoke to a nurse who said her own daughter was ill but she said she couldnapost afford to take time off. Itaposs just such a shame they canapost see everyone as quickly as they should do. Everyone who goes to AE will say the same thing - we canapost pretend itaposs not happening. A spokesperson at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said: “We are really sorry that Hannah and Penelope have had to wait to be treated on a number of occasions over the recent months.  Our staff are working really hard to support patients and families during an exceptionally busy time and are working tirelessly to provide the best possible care under extreme pressures. “We recognise that we were not able to deliver our usual high standards of care in a timely manner and offer our sincere apologies to Hannah and her family. We would be very happy to discuss this further with Hannah.” Hannahaposs experience adds to a catalogue of other shameful waiting times others have endure at AE units across the  country. Earlier this week a mum-of-two said she was reduced to tears and pleaded with nurses for a doctor to see her three-week-old baby who waited  hours for a hospital bed.  Kertu Babik said her daughter Blanka was eventually diagnosed with bronchiolitis and spent a week recovering at Leeds General Infirmary. She spoke out after it emerged that a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia was forced to sleep on a cold floor for more than four hours because of a shortage of beds at the same hospital. Jackaposs desperate mum Sarah Williment covered her son in coats in a bid to keep him warm and comfortable.

Surgeons at Birminghamaposs Queen Elizabeth Hospital also found two benign cysts in her lymph nodes and a malignant tumour in her liver in a March  operation. “Luckily the cysts in the lymph nodes had contained the malignant tumour and stopped it spreading further, Beth added.  “I was in intensive care for six days and it took me a few months to recover as it was such a big operation – I had been cut open from my chest to my belly – but I was determined to get back on my feet again and get back to university.” Bethaposs mum, Claire Ingram, praised her daughter for being strong during her treatment and for continuing her studies. She said:  “Seeing your child in intensive care with all these tubes coming out of her is so awful, the worst thing for a parent. But Beth has been absolutely amazing through all of this – we are in awe of her. The doctors wanted Beth to leave University in order to deal with her treatment but she simply refused. She even managed to pass her driving test too.”  Beth, now , has thrown her weight behind Cancer Research UKaposs aposRight Nowapos campaign which encourages people to donate, volunteer, fundraise or share their cancer story. Her friends and family have also helped her raise £, for the charity.

Zoe Curry was ready to take on a busy evening when she turned up to Wildwood in Newmarket, Cambridgeshire. The -year-old did not realise however, that she would be waiting on a Christmas party of  by herself, Cambridge News reported. Zoeaposs boyfriend Robbie Gove posted about the fretful experience on Facebook , explaining how she was told she was going to be dealing with a Christmas party upstairs, but what she wasnapost told was that by that they meant the entirety of upstairsall by herself. Zoe said: I had two tables of , two tables of , plus other tables in there and the idea was I was going to collect the orders and the other guy that was meant to be with me was going to run drinks up and down the stairs and run food as well. I only had to greet people, take their drinks orders then sort out their payments at the end. He went downstairs to go fetch the drinks and that was the last I pretty much saw of him. Zoe felt increasingly under pressure and says the customers began to get irate about the wait. The thing that broke me was so ridiculous, explained Zoe. A woman asked me for ketchup and I realised I didnapost have any ketchup upstairs so I went downstairs to get some and went out the back and bawled my eyes out by the bins.  I had people coming at me from all sides asking where their food and drinks were. After she broke down Zoe says she struggled to regain a grip on her emotions, even shedding a tear in front of customers as she raced back to work. One table of customers had enough with the situation and walked out without paying, Zoe said. A table walked out, understandably, said Zoe, and I went home and I cried to my mum in the car and I got home and cried to Robbie and my friends that were at the house. Later that evening Zoe received a text from one of her managers.  She said: I received the text message at half past midnight telling me not to come to my sht the next day, that we donapost want a repeat of today and Iaposd have to come in for a meeting with the assistant manager on Monday at pm. Thataposs when I completely broke down with aposOh my god, this is badapos. After spending most of the day on Sunday crying, Zoe claims she walked into her meeting on Mondayto find out that she had been fired. She described how the assistant manager slid a letter across the table, sheepishly I might add, and he let me read it. He didnapost even have the words to say youaposre dismissed or youaposre fired, that was the worst bit.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"exercise-labelling-food-drink-could-better-curbing-obesity","story":"They said the current system of food labelling by calorie and nutrient content is poorly understood, and there is limited evidence that it is encouraging consumers to make healthier purchases.In a paper published in the Journal of Epidemiology  Community Health, the researchers from Loughborough University said labelling by exercise instead had the potential to cut daily calorie intake per person by an average of up  calories.: Children from poorest households in Scotland twice as likely to be obesePhysical activity calorie equivalent or expenditurefood labelling aims to show how many minutes or miles of physical activity are needed to burn off the calories in a particular food or drink.For example, eating  calories in a small bar of milk chocolate would require about  minutes of walking or  minutes of running to burn these off.The UK Royal Society for Public Health has already called for PACE labelling to replace the current system, but to date, there has been little strong evidence to back this stance.The Loughborough University researchers analysed  randomised controlled trials comparing PACE to other forms of food labelling, or no labelling.They found that when PACE labelling was displayed on food and drink items and on menus, consumers took in  fewer calories per meal, on average.PACE labelling was also associated with the consumption of  to  fewer calories than no food labelling, or other types of labelling.Based on their findings, and average consumption of three meals a day plus two snacks, the researchers suggest that PACE labelling might potentially slice almost  calories off a typical iniduals daily intake.However, they caution that the studies were small and not carried out in real le settings, such as restaurants and supermarkets.Nevertheless, they conclude that PACE labelling \"shows some promise in reducing the number of kilocalories [calories] selected from menus, as well as the number of calories and the amount of foodconsumed.: Dentists leader say profession set up to fail byoverly complex fees systemThe evidence shows that even a relatively small reduction of around  calories per day, combined with a sustained increase in physical activity, is likely to be good for health and could help curb obesity at the population level.They add: ldquoPACE labelling is a simple strategy that could be easily included on food beverage packaging by manufacturers, on shelving price labels in supermarkets, and or in menus in restaurants fast-food outlets.ldquoPublic health agencies may want to consider the possibility of including policies to promote [it] as a strategy that contributes to the prevention and treatment of obesity and related diseases.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10338714.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cash-regulated-utility-like-water-ensure-free-msps-told","story":"Speaking at a meeting of Holyroodrsquos Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee on Tuesday, Adrian Roberts, the chief commercial officer for Link, called for action to ensure people are not charged for taking out their own cash describing it as a \"universal need\".It comes after the Herald revealed ministers have refused to intervene in the access-to-cash crisis ndash as it has emerged that around  free-to-use ATMs in Scotland have continued to shut down every week in the last year.Meanwhile, more than one-third of Scotlands bank branches have closed between January  and August this year.

But the SNPrsquos vision for independence is not one of real change, in fact it represents no change at all to the way our economy is run.In government, the SNP has put rhetoric before real change.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yet nothing is certain. Boris Johnson could still miss the goal spectacularly like Diana Ross famously missed that penalty at the ‘ World Cup opening ceremony.He undoubtedly has flair and talent, but can he be trusted to deliver  That has been the central issue that has limited his undoubted appeal and held him back from achieving an unassailable lead.At the outset of the campaign I argued that the election was Boris Johnson’s to lose. The danger facing him was that having benefitted from the public’s growing sense of grievance about Parliament obstructing the deliverance of Brexit he might be drawn into fighting on the ground of his opponents choosing where he could be more easily beaten. He might lose points on the NHS, he might be outflanked on social care or ridiculed for increasing police numbers that his party originally cut. Whatever the issue, Johnson had to remind the public that the general election had been called earlier than should be expected, and thatthey truly wanted to end their boredom and exhaustion with Brexit they must make a choice between giving him a majority – or sending him packing.In the end, from my own admittedly subjective viewpoint, Johnson has managed to hold on to a diminished lead because his main opponents have been unable to land any signicant blows. Indeed the very question of being able to trust Johnson that has been levelled at him by other leaders such as Corbyn, Sturgeon and Swinson has only raised the questions of trust in them.Labour’s revered Aunt Sally – the threat posed to the NHS by the dreaded Tories – becomes less convincing each time she is wheeled out in her bathchair. Thanks to the changing demographics a lot more demand is putting a strain on resources and with changing technology the costs rise further. NHS costs keep going up and this will not change whichever party governs the nation. Labour can argue you can’t trust the Tories on the NHS all it wants but it rings hollow when we know they say this every election and that every time they are in office they increase spending on the NHS – even during the period of austerity when other departments had their budgets cut.Nor do the attacks from Labour and the SNP about the threat of privatisation of NHS services have credibility.Their idea was to use President Trump as a bogey man but my MEP colleague Henrik Overgaard-Nin, a practising dentist and former head of the General Dental Practice Committee, utterly demolished this thesis last week by categorising how it has been the European Union forcing the growth of private provision of services in the NHS. Likewise it is the EU that was pushing a trade deal with President Obama that could have opened up the NHS further.In all of these points it is those such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson who by fighting to deliver Brexit are the real defenders of the NHS remaining accountable to the British electorate.In Scotland, the claims of Nicola Sturgeon are especially weak. The scandals of the tragic and avoidable deaths of children in Glasgow’s new infirmary due to contaminated water, and the unopened Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh costing an extra £ million that leaves her especially vulnerable to an accusation of rank hypocrisy. Claims about trust on law and order under Johnson – made after his promise to recruit , more police in England when it was the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats who originally reduced their numbers following the great recession – have no value when put by other parties who have their own records to feel ashamed about. This week in London the th murder was committed, surpassing last year’s total of  with three weeks of  still to go. The comparison of Johnson’s record as London mayor against the current Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, puts labour in the dock, not the Tories. Likewise the state of Scottish policing was brought into sharp focus by the resignation of Susan Deacon as the chair of the Scottish Police Authority claiming its governance and accountability is fundamentally flawed.While the issue of trust has undoubtedly undermined the Boris Johnson campaign it has not been a knockout blow, for sadly too many politicians come with the same reputational challenge about trust. Nicola Sturgeon promised the  independence referendum was “once in a generation” then “once in a letime” vote but started campaigning for a second referendum practically from the moment her campaign was defeated. At first she was careful enough to suggest it might take a few years but now, five years on and she has been pressing incessantly for a second vote – certainly not a generation later.Corbyn has his reputational problem with past associations with terrorist groups and now wishes to take our industrial relations back to the unrest of the seventies. Then there is labour’s ant-Semitism problem. Do people really trust Jeremy Corbyn The largest issue of trust for me is Johnson’s claim that only he can “get Brexit done”. It is proving a convincing slogan with the public fit to burst over the incessant parliamentary infighting and sharp practices to deliver a deal that suits the EU and leaves our country ided. I do not accept Boris’s “deal’ is anything other than an attempt to move the issue out of the public eye and play down the further capitulations of the UK’s interest that are yet to come. I fully expect the Prime Minister to get his majority and therefore get his deal through parliament – but I do not expect him to secure anything like the free trade deal with the EU that he claims is within his gt, nor do I expect him to go for leaving without a deal – so I foresee yet another extension to our membership after the end of .That’s why we need Brexit Party MPs to press Johnson to deliver, without them millions will have no voice. I would like to think I am wrong but this Brexit General Election could well prove fruitless and undermine public trust in politicians even more.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch brexit won t get done if boris wins an snp backed labour government is safer bet","story":"#Getting Brexit done# will simply continue to overshadow everything , says Lesley Riddoch.If the Tories get a working majority on Thursday, as predicted, will Boris Johnson actually get Brexit done  Will politicsto something like normal Even at a time of fairytales, flying reindeer, Wise Men and Tinkerbell most adults realise the answer to both questions is a resounding no.Passing Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreementmarks only the end of the beginning – the first stage of a bitter, contested orce which moves on to the financial settlement and future trade negotiations. These must be concluded more speedily than any similar deal in political history andthe shambolic UK negotiating team fails – by accident or by design – the inhabitants of Britain will face the same “no deal” clf edge next Christmas that was supposedly seen off in .This much we know. Every news bulletin and parliamentary debate will continue to be dominated by Brexit in . Uncertainty will blight investment, job security, le-plans, recruitment and the quality of public services. The unbelievable total of , nursing vacancies in the English NHS will not diminish but increase as EU workers finally depart for good. There will be no Golden Age for public services – why should there be when the new boss is actually the old boss  At a deeper level, how can Brexit ever “get done” when leaving is bitterly opposed by millions of voters who will neither abandon their commitment to European identity, nor be accommodated in any way by the new Prime Minister. Thus, Europe will only become more isive and totemic as an issue and will continue to distract from the seismic issues of inequality, climate crisis, and democratic modernisation the entire British political system has chosen to ignore. Most Tory voters and even Brexit supporters know this in their hearts.They back Boris, not to get Brexit done but because he’s the one who lets them dream a while longer, indulges make-believe, allows disorientated people to take respite from the bleakness and empty affluence his party has created with the vain hope of making Britain great again. No harsh realities, dficult choices or tough reappraisals from Santa Johnson. You only have to believe in his magical powers, his innate superiority and his bona fides. Or pretend. It’s like an electoral version of the Stockholm syndrome. Some depressing yet powerful human dynamics are at work.So, a Boris win is likely – but looking on the bright side, a Tory majority would change the thrust of political debate in early .Firstly, it would rob Boris Johnson of the chance to keep posing as the champion of The People against an evil, unresponsive, high-handed Remainer Parliament. If he becomes Prime Minister again, that “self-serving political elite” will largely be his own hand-picked “do or die” foot-soldiers. Any mistakes, delays, crassness or missed deadlines will be entirely and demonstrably his fault and no-one ’s. Alienated Tory big beasts like John Major will join with expelled grandees like Michael Heseltine to rub the new leader’s nose in it – and he must watch for signs of mutiny amongst hisloyal band of lieutenants Gove, Hancock, Javid and Raab – all of whom wanted to be leader themselves. At the first sign of trouble they could try to challenge Johnson, supported by Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May on the backbenches, nursing their wrath to keep it piping hot.Boris may be the darling of the Tory Party membership, but he will have very few friends in Parliament or , in the capital city. Is Johnson an accomplished political tightrope walker – we may soon find out.Secondly, an overall majority would probably also rob Boris of his best recruiting sergeant – Jeremy Corbyn. Not even Teflon Tony could have withstood the sustained and concerted hatchet-job Corbyn has faced every waking day for the last five weeks. The Labour leader has made the media’s job easier than it needed to be, but he’s also overseen a much-needed policy alignment. If Labour’s popular programme of renationalisation and public ownership is wedded to a new, more articulate and assertive leader – Boris will face real, spirited political opposition every inch of the way in . Thirdly, a Boris working majority would also end the absurdity of Arlene Foster and the DUP \u2028representing the views of Remain voting Northern Ireland. Greens and other small parties won’t stand against some Alliance and SDLP candidates, so there’s a chance Ms Foster’s personal authority will be seriously clipped – and that this could precipitate the much-predicted break-up of Britain.Astonishingly, it’s influential parts of the London media who’ve decided that’s on the cards.Channel Four anchor Jon Snow is travelling around the Celtic nations, making a series of films about dissatisfaction in the devolved nations. Radio Four’s flagship World this Weekend is planning an hour-long debate on the future of the United Kingdom for next week. Doubtless, more is planned.It’s ironic. The Conservatives have won elections in the teeth of fierce opposition from Scots for decades. But Brexit has finally thrown that crushing unfairness into sharp relief and a supportive media spotlight. So too have recent opinion polls which suggest a majority of Scots would support independenceBoris Johnson triggers withdrawal from the EU. London’s sudden interest in Scotland’s constitutional bind is welcome, but dangerous too. Enthusiasm may soon waneScots don’t live up to our newfound billing as the Remain rebels who Won’t Stand For Brexit. Unfairly, since no smaller member of this “family of nations” has yet found a way to exercise authority or be heard. But the British media doesn’t do fair, patient, marginal or incremental. So, the pressure will not relent. Brexit won’t get doneBoris wins the vote. And an SNP-supported Corbyn government is still a much better bet.

As an obstetrician, I have written often about the priority we should put on the health of our pregnant women and families as they truly hold the future health of the nation in their hands.We are less good at talking about the end of le, dying and the bereavement that follows. Circumstances surrounding a loved one’s death can be remembered by those left behind for the rest of their lives. The impact on families of a ‘bad death’ can be devastating and, of course, there is also an effect on healthcare professionals who deal with death and dying frequently.I remember a weekend working on the maternity unit when I was pregnant with my first child. I met a young woman who was at the same stage as me, but her baby had stopped moving. Initial scans had failed to find a heartbeat. Often this is when I can use my experience to find that elusive heartbeat, but not that day. I had to tell that young couple that their baby, their child, had died – feeling so guilty that mine was still alive. At the end of my sht, I felt exhausted, bereft and deeply sad.: Le expectancy going backwards in ‘many parts’ of Scotland, report finds: Grieving Scottish couple’s stillbirth charity to benefit from Christmas concertIt is often said that time heals but I am not sure about that. I think the passage of time can make it easier to deal with grief, but the pain may never leave us.Conversations are starting around ‘living’ grief and bereavement. As the numbers of people living with dementia increases, the experience of their carers is becoming a focus. They are living with and caring for someone, often a lelong partner, who may no longer care for them or even recognise them.Not a time of joy for allCarers may be isolated, restricted by the frailty and confused behaviour of the person they look after. Comments come from others like “at least they’re still with you”, yet they are grieving for the person they have already lost. For example, “I’m not a widow yet, but I don’t feel married either”, as one lady told me. Carers feel guilty and internalise their own emotions. Together in Dementia Everydayoffers a support network for the carers of those with dementia, allowing those dficult thoughts and feelings to be surfaced.I recently attended an NHS Education for Scotland conference that used the power of patient stories to explore the impact of bereavement on people. The main realisation was that we need to give our staff the permission, time, space, and support to discuss these cases as teams, exploring feelings and emotions, not just clinical facts. It often feels safer to focus on the latter, but the former may prove far more therapeutic. This, of course, can apply to the conversations we also have with patients and families and you can have with your own families at home.Why indeed am I writing an article about death and bereavement, when you perhaps want to read something uplting at this time of year The reality is that Christmas is not a time of joy for everyone – loss can be felt keenly, absence of a family member all the more obvious, a strong sense of missing someone or shared experiences, a trigger for grief suppressed. So at this time of preparation for celebration often with family, take some time to really talk, to acknowledge grief and even the awkwardness about mentioning it. I guarantee both you and the person you are talking to will feel better for it.

By the age of about  I realised this was increasingly unlikely to happen, partly based on the fact that most other boys were at least a foot taller than me by this point, but largely based on my complete lack of ability. But as I lay on my bed looking up at my carefully curated collage of adverts torn out of FHM and Loaded magazines, Michael Jordan looked back at me and told me to Just Do It.Whether it was inspired by Gary Gilmore’s final words before being executed doesn’t really matter, in  Nike’s trademark slogan was being plastered all over the world and  years later it’s still going strong. It’s enabled and empowered new generations of go-getters and high achievers – the ultimate mantra to prove anyone from anywhere could achieve anything in lethey put their mind to it. Wake up, get up, and Just Do It. Do early morning yoga classes, do a gym session at lunch, and do a creative writing course in the evenings so you can do your blog. Do a marathon at the weekend. Do that job promotion, do that new business plan and do the extra hours that you know will pay off one day. Do work emails in the rain whilst ignoring your children playing rugby, do amazing meals with exotic ingredients imported from all over the world and do luxury holidays filled with doing even more stuff. Fill your le with acts of great signicance and meaning and they will build statues in your honour. Just F***ing Do It.Of course, we also need to remind ourselves that we need to do the washing up, do the laundry and do the weekend shop too. All the stuff that Jordan and Charles Barkley never seem to mention in their adverts, like doing the car insurance renewal. We live in a world of perpetual doing. The list simply doesn’t end. There’s never a point where you get to check your list and say with a smug smile, “I’ve got nothing to do.”Which is perhaps exactly why we need to force ourselves to do less. Give ourselves time to switch off and do absolutely nothing.A few thousand years ago our lives were a lot more simple. Not necessarily easier, but certainly less filled with stuff to do. You got up, ate, fed your livestock, went in search of food, spent some time sharpening spears or arrows, looked for more food, then maybe whiled away a couple of hours making fires or doing some recreational drawing on the walls of your cave. Today – thanks to the miracle of smartphones – we can’t go  minutes with checking to seesomeone’s emailed a message that we probably don’t want to read, or updated their profile with a picture we don’t want to see.Not only are we stuffing our lives with more stuff to do on a daily hourly minutely basis, but we’ve more choices than ever before. A few years ago one national supermarket chain had  ieties of air freshener,  types of rice,  ieties of cola and a mind-blowing  ieties of coffee. No self-respecting café in  would ever dare offer you the binary option of black or white. We want dferent blends from dferent countries with dferent methods and dferent syrups and dferent milks and dferent foams.All this stuff squeezed into exactly the same amount of hours in the day that our cave-dwelling ancestors had. We simply don’t have the time for things to go wrong, sosomeone dares behave in a manner that dfers slightly from our own expectation of acceptable behaviour – for example, eating a boiled egg on a crowded commuter train – then a whole arsenal of toys are going to be ejected from the pram.Manners have nothing to do with class or wealth – as so frequently demonstrated by a iety of overpaid public figures – they cost nothing, after all. But they do take time, and in our busy little bubbles that’s almost more valuable than money. We’re cash rich and time poor, so who gives monkey’swe offend a few people by clipping our nails on the train or pushing to the front of the queue  You’ll probably never see those iniduals again anyway. We’ve all got a million things to do and are constantly reminded of the million things other people are doing, so the faster we can get things done the better, right  Well wrong. The faster we get things done the faster we get them done. Doing things properly always takes a lot more time, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “Manners require time, and nothing is more vulgar than haste.”Whether you’re doing the weekly daily hourly grocery shop, taking a group of hyperactive kids to the cinema, or signing up at your local meditation class, please, forget just looking after number one, and be on the look-out for number two as well. It’s much more dangerous when it hits the air-cooling device.We’re not talking Mother Teresa levels of selflessness here, just a few moments of clarity when we acknowledge that perhaps flossing your undercarriage within two feet of someone’s face in the changing room, might not be to everyone’s delight. A little lightbulb that pings on as you smugly sprint to the front of the newly opened checkout that tells you maybe other people have been waiting a little longer.We don’t need to Just Do It or Live Le to the Max. Turn off your f***ing phone and experience the truly le-changing miracles of doing one thing at a time. Only when we can treat ourselves to this level of kindness, will we be able to pass on that kindness to others.Simon Grfin is the author of F***ing Good Manners .

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement..."},{"url":null,"title":"car of the week suzuki celerio sx2 ","story":".L Petrol, White, Delivery Mileage or give us a call on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"harbour assistant at shetland island council ","story":"Outline of Duties: Maintain basic harbour log including names of vessels using harbour, date and time of arrival, etc. Inspect harbour structures reporting any defects to the appropriate authorities.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/001WH2911NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 29th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death. A Kids’ Craft room will be open for children to take some time to also engage with the theme of Christmas Joy.When you’ve spent some time taking in the Christmas forest, head through the link corridor to the new hall, where hot drinks and festive treats will be served. Viewing of the trees and enjoying refreshments can take place on Friday pm-pm, Saturday am-.pm and Sunday pm-pm. The suggested donation for entrance is £and gts will be gratefully received.Rev. Ross Harte from Dromore Methodist Church explained: “We are honoured that the Festival will be opened by the Lord Mayor of Armagh, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council, Councillor Mealla Campbell . The Methodist North Eastern District Superintendent, the Rev. Philip Agnew, will lead us in prayer during the Opening Ceremony and a local school choir will be singing.“Our annual Christmas Fair will be happening as usual on Saturday, December  , with crafts, cakes, decorations and a range of second-hand books and goods on offer. On the Saturday evening we’re looking forward to Storyteller and Methodist Lay Leader, Mrs. Lynda Neilands, joining us for an informal Worship Night at pm. The evening will include lots of singing, and Lynda will be telling Christmas stories.“The following daywe’ll be delighted to welcome the Methodist President, the Rev. Sam McGuffin, as preacher for our Sunday morning service at am. And the Christmas Tree Festival will conclude with our annual Carol Service at .pm. All special events are open to the public.“We’re really looking forward to this celebration of joy, and with nearly forty Christmas trees confirmed it promises to be a beautul and inspiring visit for all who come to view the displays and enjoy refreshments afterwards.”Family and police are desperately searching for missing Gillian Barr - last seen days ago Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"enda is paddling his own canoe","story":"Journey to the Edge by Enda O’Coineen, £, Ballpoint PressBook ReviewBy Máirtín Ó MuilleoirEnda O’Coineen has lived a le of extremes.From businessman behind the Iron Curtain to Sunday Business Post owner, his approach is characterised by one indelible characteristic: he likes to paddle his own canoe.Those given to radical even reckless adventuring are often dismissed as head-bangers, and, to be fair, the Galway native, does his own share of self-deprecating doubting of his own sanity.The reality, however, is far dferent: you don’t achieve the stellar success of the man who set up the first stock exchange in Prague or lead a successful investment fund without being a canny judge of human nature and a shrewd assessor of risk.Indeed, it’s the management of risk which forms the theme of Journey to the Edge, the intrepid entrepreneur’s account of his dangerous but liberating single-handed circumnavigation of the globe. O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed. We were only  minutes in and pan-nationalism and pan-unionism both seemed in tatters – except in North and South Belfast of course.Eastwood has enjoyed a good campaign. The nadir of his party’s  removal from Westminster left some wondering whether the SDLP would ever . He now stands of the brink of heading here along with a colleague. The SDLP leader may also have been buoyed by the apparent photo endorsement from Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Interesting that, given it is only eleven months since the launch of the “historic partnership” between the SDLP and, er, Fianna Fáil — a tie-up rejected by the SDLP’s MP-to-be in South Belfast.Naomi Long performed solidly and it has been a fine year for her party, its vote up % in the council elections and % in the Europeans. But a First-Past-the-Post contest remains dficult terrain for Alliance. Another issue is that Westminster contests are for the true believers. In , those identying as unionist or nationalist were twice as likely to vote as those eschewing such labels.The debate moved onto the health crisis and the associated problem of Assembly restoration. It was everyone ’s fault that it was mothballed. Not their party’s responsibility. Oh no. Michelle O’Neill gave no ground on an Irish Language Act, insisting it was a right. “It’s not an either or” in terms of a Language Act versus dealing with the health crisis was her line. Good luck with those talks on Monday, Secretary of State.Each representative performed creditably. But how much any of Tuesday night really mattered is questionable. The viewing figure for Sunday night’s UTV leaders’ debate was just shy of ,. More watched the programme immediately afterwards, where the contestants had to eat grubs in a jungle. Maybe UTV host Marc Mallett should have made similar demands upon the politicians. An internal BBC document this week showed less than half of - year olds watch BBC in an average week — and younger electors are least likely to vote anyway.A viewing figure of , for an election debate is not a bad figure, but over , people voted in Northern Ireland’s  Westminster election.So,  out of  voters last time didn’t bother tuning in.

However, this campaign has a dferent feel.If Eastwood and Claire Hanna are both elected, the party is back at the races in terms of being competitive with Sinn Fein.

His performances in TV debates have been mixed.He did land blows on the DUP in Tuesdays BBC head-to-head. But the big question is whether moderate unionists disillusioned with the DUP will switch to the UUP or Alliance.Naomi Longs party outpolled the UUP in the EU election. If it managed to do the same in this one - or even go near - it would be disastrous for the UUP.Alliance will suffer in some constituencies from the first-past-the-post system leading to tactical voting. But the party is tapping into a public mood of utter frustration with the DUP and Sinn Fein. Anecdotal evidence suggests that evenit doesnt win seats, Alliance could poll very strongly in some places."},{"url":null,"title":"some children being minded in homes that are not very safe taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But, there is a risk that it will be implemented in a heavy-handed way and that’s the concern that I’m hearing across the country.Mr Howlin askedthe Government could give reassurance to childminders that they would not be prosecuted for non-compliance.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said often children are minded by someone they know or an au pair for a few hours every day and it is convenient for parents who cannot or do not want to put their children into a creche.“We don’t want to over-regulate, undermine or get rid of that system becausewe did it would be disaster for tens of thousands of people would find that they didn’t have any way to look after their kids any more.“We definitely don’t want to over-regulate, or be too heavy-handed in any reforms that we bring in, in this area.”“At the same time we do need to put children first and we can’t ignore the fact that there are some children who are being minded in homes that aren’t very safe.“Those children could get injured, and there are health and safety issues in those houses that are providing informal childcare at the moment.“We also need to bear in mind that some people who are childminders – as we learned to our detriment when it came to foster parents in the past – had a bad record when it came to how they dealt with children, and we need to make sure that we don’t make those mistakes again.“So, this is a work in progress. I think we all acknowledge we need to get the balance right in terms of protecting children, but also making sure that we don’t close down an entire informal sector of childminding which serves families well but we need to get the balance right.”Mr Howlin questioned some of the requirements the Government has proposed for childminders, askingthey are necessary.“Officials have admitted that childminders must sign up to strict standards of care, or face prosecution. For example, Garda vetting is clearly essential but do childminders need to have a level five qualication in order to continue to operate as a childminder ”“Providing a safe and caring environment for children does not necessarily require that level of formal qualications, and there are many iniduals involved in childminding right now, who never had the opportunity to go to third level education.“This requirement is seen by those rightly as being extraordinarily onerous. Childminders are also concerned about the level of inspection of their family homes that may result from these new regulations,” he said.“There needs to be greater recognition that childminding is an activity carried out in the private space of people’s homes, rather than in any formal or structured business setting.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

He obviously knew he was onto a winner, because this year he yet again took inspiration from the fashion house – this time in the form of a sofa.Nuriev stuffed a large couch with off-cuts of Balenciaga clothes that weren’t going to be sold, making for an incredibly chic sitting situation.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season, they won the Grade D final and after a gutsy display, with goals at the right time, lted the McDevitt Cupon Tuesday afternoon at Celtic Park. The decisive score came in the st minute with a winning goal from St Conors midfielder Eoin Mullan. The sides met in the group stages and it was the Tyrone side who prevailed. As predicted by St Conors coach Declan Toner, the final went right down to the wire. googletag.cmd.push St Ciarans got into their groove in the second-half and looked the likely winners, but St Conors dug in and always had a response. Sean OConnell scored - in vain for Ballygawley, while Ryan Mallons runs from midfield gave the Tyrone side the impetus for their comeback. Oliver Wasoski opened the scoring for St Ciarans with the first of three goals in a frantic opening  minutes. Ben Murphy pounced on a rebound when Tommy Rodgers shot came off the bar, before dispatching to the bottom corner of the net to level the score.

He imposed all the suspended sentences concurrently and imposed a six month sentence on the latest charges.  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whether the issue was support for planning applications, working for inward investment, attending education or social security benefit appeals it is my view that constituency work is the cornerstone of any elected representative.“As an elected representative for over  years I am proud to say that I have been a voice for all sections of our community, irrespective of religious affiliation or political opinion. I am your voice and will continue to be that voice in Mid Ulster with your support.“This election has been brought about at the behest of a British government that has failed the people. That same government has forced signicant financial cuts to the Stormont budget leading to cuts in health, cuts in education, cuts in infrastructure and cuts in every department of the Assembly.“This election has been brought about because of a failed policy on Brexit which has the potential to bring economic chaos across the north of Ireland. It is time to send a clear message to the British government that the people of Mid Ulster oppose your cuts, your austerity and oppose being forced out of the EU.“A new Ireland is achievable and I am calling for a strategic programme to plan for a referendum on Irish unity to be put in place. We need to bring together people from all sections of Irish society including political, business, education, health and many more to create the vision for the future of this island.”“Only by voting Sinn Feacutein – Molloy X – can you send that clear message.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

in Capitol Hill, the Daacuteil, Brussels and Downing Street.“We’re on the EU side of the negotiating table and with our MEPs, MPs, TDs, MLAs we’ve certainly made a dference.“Sinn Feacutein has also delivered for East Derry.“We have led the way by decentralizing the DAERA headquarters to Ballykelly and bringing high quality public sector jobs to the north west.“As Minister for Infrastructure, Chris Hazzard delivered the A and the Dungiven bypass after decades of waiting.“Sinn Feacutein education ministers invested in the schools estate across the constituency and we have also delivered on community and sports facilities. “Sinn Feacutein is committed to delivering on investment and jobs across the constituency and improving the infrastructure including roads and broadband. “Sinn Feacutein is also committed to protecting our environment and natural heritage, and to effectively tackling the Climate Emergency through urgent and concerted action.“Sinn Feacutein remains fully invested and committed to the Good Friday Agreement.“The current political impasse is unsustainable and unacceptable and Sinn Feacutein stands ready to form a credible executive.“We want to see a new Assembly and a new kind of politics in the New year is what we’re working towards.“We want an Executive which is to be credible, delivering on issues such as public sector pay, safe staffing levels in the health service, investment in our schools, economic policies that deliver prosperity for all and that invests in rural communities, and a mitigation package that protects people from Tory welfare reform.“This is the election of a generation because what the people decide now will shape the direction of our politics, economy and future for years to come.“Discussion about our constitutional future is clearly on the agenda.“It is now a question of when notthe referendum on Irish unity will be held.“In April , the EU made a declaration which says that in the event of a successful referendum on Irish unity, the North would automatically come back into the EU with the rest of Ireland.“Irish unity is a means to enjoy many more benefits than what the union with Britain has on offer.“A stark choice is opening up between the narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain and the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland.“We’re without doubt entering a decade of opportunity where the freedom to choose our own future will be decided by all of the people on this island alone.“The opportunity now exists over this new decade to bring people together.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It came from a poor line-out which saw Derry lose possession and Enniscorthy broke quickly with second row Tomas Stamp scoring and Ivan Poole converting for the first of seven tries.Enniscorthy, with just one defeat in seven games ahead of this one, had the lead they wanted and they picked their moments again and again to frustrate Derrry. The home side looked short on ideas against a disciplined defence with brief forays by the energetic Simon Logue giving glimmers of hope, but the final pass did not live up to the build up.Enniscorthy were devastatingly efficient and when prop Sam Duffy was yellow-carded on  minutes the visitors wasted no time in striking again, a line-out ending with quick passing which opened Derry up for Ivan Jacob to score right under the posts. An easy conversion for Poole made it -.A frustrating first half ended on a positive note for Derry with Alex McDonnell converting a penalty to get the hosts on the scoreboard, but a big effort was needed second halfthis was going to go anywhere for OKanes side. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The next score was crucial in this one and Derry began the second period positively, but within ten minutes the comeback looked beyond them as Enniscorthy, so clinical, hit two more scores. Davy Murphy hit the visitors third try to put daylight between the teams and after another yellow card, this time to Derrys Dara Gill, Poole scored and converted to make the score a daunting - with just  minutes played.This Derry team are not known for giving in however and to their credit they responded well to score their first try. David Ferguson was the driving force behind the period of pressure which eventually led to the score, with McDonell eventually picking his way through the Enniscorthy line to score a try which he also converted.Any hope of a comeback was killed inside four minutes however when David ODwyer replied for Enniscorthy to make it -. Kept comingAt this stage the win was Enniscorthys but Derry still kept coming. A yellow card for Enniscorthys Paddy Waters offered a glimmer of a hope of a losing bonus point and when Callum OHagan scored to take the game to -, it became a real possibility. One more score would have given Derry that point but in the dying seconds of the game, two misplaced passes gave Kidd and Dunne simple scores, to put an emphatic score on the result that Derry did not deserve.All eyes now turn to the game at Midleton this week, with Derry desperate to get another away win to take the pressure off. This defeat sees Derry drop two places to ninth in Division C but four points on the road this week could change the picture dramatically and see Derry enter the play-off places. With Midleton also desperate for points to avoid become marooned at the foot of the table, it will be all to play for in the last game before the Christmas break.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held. For the first time in the history of the society one judge travelled from England to adjudicate.SHRIGLEY mdash A quantity of leather coats valued at pound, were stolen when the offices of the Ulster Leather Company at Shrigley were broken into. The thieves gained entry by smashing a window and made off with  coats.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar War Memorial Hall was packed to capacity for a concert organised by Wellington Memorial Silver Band.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves.

Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
